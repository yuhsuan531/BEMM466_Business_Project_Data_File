"Temu treats me and I assume it's other customers like a child. I made my first order and even before the delivery date, I'm bombarded with WhatsApp messages and emails apologising for the delivery being late (even though it's still not due) with poorly worded, deceitful offers. An embarrassing way to run a potentially great business. They will be here for the short term and not the long run.",2,12/11/2022
"Ordered 4 Tops , carefully selected my size and pleasantly surprised that the fit was  goodif not a little big, after reading other  comments I am well pleased . The quality for the price is goid. Delivery by Evri on time too",5,12/11/2022
"I bought 5 different items from temu had issues with all of them temu never offered to repair replace or make it right wIth me.  Everything I bought has broke or fallen apart.   Shoes fall apart after wearing 2 times just walking in them, watch doesn't work, hat the patch stitching came out , DC power converter doesn't work, money clip stretchy bands broke it was only 4 days of use.  I called made complaints nothing was done to make right.",1,12/11/2022
My order never got delivered to  me but a completed different address? lucky for me a kind old man from across town took the time and dropped off my package - no numbers to contact or unable to contact through the tracker number. That will be my last order.,1,12/11/2022
Are the products on Temu good quality? Temu is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and has an average rating of two-and-a-half out of five stars. Many recent complaints about Temu on the BBB website say that items never arrived or took weeks or even months to arrive.,1,12/11/2022
"I absolutely love Temu. My whole wardrobe is from Temu, some really unusual things at fantastic prices. I've bought garden furniture, kitchen accessories, curtains, toys. I wouldn't shop anywhere else. Returns are very easy and hassle free.  It's a 5 star from me !! Thankyou Temu ????????????",5,12/11/2022
"Now they want more information to better understand the problem. I say this to them. ""look at Roxy's account, see how much she has spent and look at the shopping cart.

"Adding more specific details as requested. I purchased 3 pairs of toe loop sandals, delivered to me 24th July 23 and 5th August last year- tan, black and dark brown, Temu you can see these in order history, I had to let you know that they are not durable,  they all broke after only wearing them once. The loop breaks and that?€?s the end of the sandal. I don?€?t have a problem with other clothes orders, but for these sandals I got very annoyed-Lesson learnt, never again!",3,13/11/2022
"Just using Temu for first time and lots to be disappointed with. First is the sheer amount of emails and notifications offering this or that. When you open the offer there is always strings attached. The emails I receive in Outlook, when I open a second window I cant interact with it (not sure if that is an Outlook problem or Temu).  Ordered 3 products Im happy with two of them :-) but Trail Camera is a nightmare. Tiny little instruction booklet that I cant read even with glasses on. Trying to follow the instructions nearly impossible, certainly not been able to get it working yet. Think the concept is good though and hopefully if Temu work on problems like ive highlighted above it might be a good thing eventually. Convinced now youtube instruction for getting Technology to work is better than instruction booklets. Hope I can find one to get my Trail Camera working.",2,13/11/2022
"Done shopping from Temu for over 2yrs now,delivery is kinda slow but still ,items you order will be delivered...Return policy is excellent.When purchasing items from Temu,read and understand what the product entails,and if satisfied,order it..If you order and find out its not what you were expecting,return it at no cost and no loss.",4,13/11/2022
"I don?€?t understand all these bad reviews. I?€?ve been shopping on Temu for over a year now, getting at least 1 delivery for work a week. I?€?ve never had any issue with quality or shipping and returns is super easy. They have reviews with images from purchasers on each item so you can check if what you order is going to be correct. I think it?€?s a wonderful site and has saved me so much money when ordering supplies for work.",5,13/11/2022
"Lost my return order been 2 weeks and can?€?t give me any help no manager No phone number no email u get the same poor customer service over and over This is the reply I am sincerely sorry for this issue, the return package is still on the way back, at this moment we are unable to provide the exact answer however, please rest assured that the warehouse team will kindly inform you as soon as possible when they received the package and finish with the inspection of the return package.",1,13/11/2022
"Great shopping experience until something goes wrong after 90 days. Shoes fell to pieces at 80 days, but because the order was PLACED over 90 days they absolutely refuse to do anything about the unwearable shoes..",2,13/11/2022
"Disgusting product,  ordered 3 grandad t.thirts from the foreign company who have at least 6 different company names selling the same rubbish.  Material was like cheese cloth, probably cost 50p to make. Can't return them all, only one. Don't touch temu, they are lying scum",1,13/11/2022
"I recently purchased an item from Temu, which was delivered by Evri. Unfortunately, the parcel box arrived damaged, and the item inside was also damaged and no longer usable. I contacted Temu about the problem and requested a refund. They informed me that I need to return the item to the post office.Given that the item is large and heavy, I explained that there should be an option for home collection for such items, as it's impractical for me to transport it myself. However, they did not provide any assistance or alternative solution.Due to this experience, I will never buy from Temu again. Returning a big and heavy item for a refund has proven to be extremely difficult, and their customer service did not address my concerns. The entire process has been a hassle. I advise others to avoid shopping with Temu to prevent similar issuesMy order id is: PO-210-06293693768311127They flag my review and it will get removed as trustpliot get paid for. Pathetic!!!!!",1,13/11/2022
"I just started ordering from TEMU a few weeks ago. Delivery has been anywhere from 7 to 14 days which is expected. Every clothing item I have ordered, except one, have been true to size and I have had many compliments when wearing such items. The t-shirts for my husband have been great. He loves them. The kitchen gadgets are to die for.  My swimsuit, leggings and dresses are adorable.",4,13/11/2022
"I order from Temu a lot and have to say they surpassed my expectations.  Prices are cheaper than Amazon, for the exact same brands and shipping is free.  Most items are shipped the same day and delivery is unexpectedly quick, even considering the time needed to go through customs.  The only reason they got 4 instead of 5 stars - the two small items which were not as described. Overall, after dozens of successful orders, I am pleased with them.",4,13/11/2022
"They purposely ""deliver"" on Friday so customers have no way to contact until Monday their ""delivery service "" called ""raven force"" if you read their Google reviews, or Reddits various accounts of the many people they scamed pretending to delivery products customers paid for and never received.  Just don't buy Temu. Stick with other reliable companies.",1,14/11/2022
"I have always been pleasantly surprised by my Temu purchases.  Many are identical to merchandise from Amazon but at a fraction of the cost.  The orders generally take 7-10 days to arrive, although I have gotten orders more quickly in some cases.  Any time I have had a problem, customer service has been fantastic, almost always giving a full refund without having to make a return.  I honestly love Temu.  Use Rakuten and get back a big refund.  Can't beat the value.",5,14/11/2022
Needed a refund as I had ordered incorrect size. Was done online within couple minutes via PayPal. Terrific service. I have never had a bad issue with  Temu.,5,14/11/2022
Hi not really a review just put in an order got a cash bundle then ordered a little more than usual kept saying 8.00 off got to the end submitted order and did not take the money off ye didwhat I was supposed to to get money off,1,14/11/2022
"Happy with delivery time. Quality of MOST items is perfectly acceptable. My issue is practically nothing fits - not even close. I'm 5'2 and a size 6/8 at the bottom and 8/10 at the top. Everything is way way too big. I ordered tops as size 8 UK size but they are a generic 'S'. Out of 4 tops I'd say 1 is an 8/10, 1 is a 10. 1 is a 12 and 1 is a 12/14 (that's how they fit on me anyway)",3,14/11/2022
"I use Temu often. Their goods are 95% of the time good quality and 5% I found wasn't so great. I don't mind it as it can be used for something else - or thrown away as the prices of the items are so low.I love the items, especially the t-shirts and earrings, from Temu. I feel that they have a wide variety of items, and it does vary in price.You have to look at the sizes given. or you will end up with smaller items than you thought. But you need to make sure of sizes. Temu gives all the information and is not misleading, you just need to make sure of sizes.Love you Temu!",5,14/11/2022
Terrible customer service. As if willingly not understanding what I write.,1,14/11/2022
Let me tell everyone something I accidentally hit order in my cart which was 121 something I amidently pressed cancel and the are only giving me 93. something back that is stupid never again will I order from them and I'm telling everyone,1,14/11/2022
"Bought some items for fishing, when they (eventually) arrived they were cheap and nasty TAT. Didn't even take to charity shop - straight into the bin. Glorified CAR BOOT.",1,14/11/2022
"I spent 3 days trying to send a complain to them and they are still making excuses and wasting my time. I played their rulete game and I had a message saying that I have 250 pounds coupon if I buy 4 items. I went through the app, and searched for different items to buy and get the coupon, I'm pregnant and I think it would be lovely to use it for the baby. Spent one hour to decide the items, gave my details and paid, during the process, I could only see that if I finish the transaction in certain time I can have my coupon, and nothing else. I paid and surprise!!there is not such coupon, it was a bundle of coupons, where you need to keep buying things to have a small discount. I feel scammed and lied by them, I immediately contacted them, that was 4 days ago, and I haven't received any resolution yet. It is very sad that company like this playing around with consumers and wasted their time and collected their data to keep sending notifications and gaining money on our behalf promising promotions, discount service or coupons that aren't true.",1,14/11/2022
Horrible! Items don?€?t arrive and they don?€?t send a refund they give you $5 credit to spend more. Really bad business no option to return anything and no help with tracking.,1,14/11/2022
I love this app. I have found some great bargains on there and always had good quality. If you read the reviews of the items you?€?re buying you can usually gage what will be the quality you?€?re after. Easy and free returns process too.,5,14/11/2022

"I was on your website. I got the free items at the time not sent to me. I was still looking and punching the free items then it went 2.99 I wanted to talk to the Boston office supposed to be the main group about what happened to me. They sent two pieces to my address at 4919 Lakeview Rd., North Little Rock, AR I didn?€?t know room. I did all the dad did you get on your side and pick pick pick and then you have to buy a bigger item to get all the other items I was on the phone on the Field page talking to Dawn first. It was frozen and it was done and the supervisor supposed to call me, I only got a email early in the morning saying about return even though that?€?s what happened to me. Hope this gets to the main corporate office because this is wrong. I don?€?t think you should charge somebody when they didn?€?t finish shopping and put the ship the order through two packages one she knocked it down to four I think 99 and going to reading for me with , the rest and the second item was a kidney shape organizer that goes under the cabinet, but I had to wait for my handyman to measure, cause I didn?€?t know which size I should get a bed with only two fingers on my right hand 75% loss and that?€?s what happened to me so far as a supervisor in the Philippines supposed to  call me within 20 hours 20 hours and I just don?€?t understand this whole deal so please call me at 501-539-6032. I would like somebody in the main corporate office to call me from Boston because the Philippine people said that your main office is in Boston, Massachusetts , so please give me a shout out",1,15/11/2022
"Temu is a notable entity that intertwines its business practices with Christian values and principles, establishing itself as a company that not only strives for commercial success but also aims to reflect the teachings of Christianity in its operations. The foundation of Temu?€?s approach is rooted in the belief that business activities should align with ethical standards and moral values that are often highlighted in Christian doctrines. This alignment manifests in several ways that contribute to its reputation as a great Christian company.",3,15/11/2022

"I've just had my 4th order delivered today and so far I've not had to return anything and have been very happy with quality I've received in all my orders.   I have only ordered household type of things, not clothing as I can see from purchasers photos on reviews that often the item is not entirely the same quality as the picture.",5,16/11/2022
Absolutely love Temu Everything I have purchased I've been so happy with and always got my orders Brilliant shop to order from and so many products,5,16/11/2022
"My order number PO-203-17009226645112792 was delivered to me, but 17 items were missing! I wrote to Temu many times for this, but they did not solve my problem. I sent a bunch of photos and videos as proof but they refuse to refund! A ticket was opened for my problem, but even the supervisors did not solve my problem! They offer me a coupon, I live in Turkey and I won't be able to order again due to customs issues, so the coupon is useless! I request a refund to my original payment method. Temu scammed me and won't refund the money for the missing items! Customer service keeps me busy by telling me the same things and does not solve my problem. I am a lawyer and this fraud you are committing is a crime! I urgently demand a refund for my missing products, otherwise I will report you to higher authorities!",1,16/11/2022
Please never buy from this company.Here?€?s why: Temu is a chinese company. They owned an app back in 2017-2018 called ?€?Pinduoduo?€?. It was banned off of the appstore for installing malware onto buyers devices and taking their information without consent. And using it for malicious purposes.Temu does the same thing. Temu takes all of your credit card information and charges your card without you buying anything. There are multiple cases and story?€?s of people who have bought from temu and have had their cards been charged randomly. Temu is a sketchy company that has done sketchy things. They are being apparently investigated as of the time i?€?m leaving this review. There are better options out there for buying cheap stuff. And this company definitely is not a good option. ;3,1,16/11/2022
i orderd from temu just to find a chese grater orderd it and it was horrible i had metel in my chese unforgetibil experince,1,16/11/2022
They told me to wait 48 hours until they will examine my refund for my missing items and nothing. They stole my money and goods and even don't care. Be careful they are scamers and cheaters. They will b..l sh..t you head and nothing more. In relation to quality it's typical Chinese produce. There is not such bad quality in the world like temu. Stay away and save you money. Or you want to pay for bins services more?.,1,17/11/2022
"Temu, took 3 weeks. Received an email stating that my locker box will arrive today. Anotehr email 2 hours later stating that my order is cancelled and I will receive a refund. I doubt I will. When contacting Temu online, we get a second hand bot that is less than useless.",1,17/11/2022
"This company is not honest at all. They didn't deliver your package and took your money. Never buy from them.Based on their contact them again with no solution.Temu is a dangerous site 'BE VERY CAREFUL'I made an order for CHF 71 on July 14, which they claim was delivered on July 22. The shipping company they used is unprofessional, which explains the low cost of this site. They mentioned that the order was delivered, but it wasn't. No one contacted us or knocked on the door, and it is not possible to leave such a large package in the mailbox.When I contacted Temu, they said they couldn't refund or reship the order until their investigation was complete. Three days passed, and I contacted them daily. They assured me my request was a high priority and that I had to wait a maximum of 24 hours, but this was extended several times. They eventually sent an email stating the order was delivered and they couldn't refund or reship it, suggesting I check if the package was left in an unexpected place. What?!When I contacted them again, their responses were copy-pasted and showed a lack of care. This company is very dangerous and not recommended at all. They lure you into buying, fail to deliver, send you copy-paste messages, and in the end, you make a donation without receiving anything.",1,17/11/2022
"Some decent good value stuff but some garbage as well. Dont waste your time playing their flash games, referral's for free items. Its easy to get to 95% then will be impossible to complete. I got to like 99.997 and each referral becomes less and less, giving me like .001 for some and none for some. Temu stick with online selling and stop the time wasters asking for referrals. Already have a trust issues with lot of people and this makes it worse. As suggested, I reached out to Temu Customer Service. Was not much help, given a 20% off coupon. Gave them many confirmed referrals and wasted hours doing it. Again, I wont waste anymore time with their promos.",3,17/11/2022
"I had high hopes for Temu, but my experience has been disappointing. The app advertises free items, but it feels like a scam. After completing numerous tasks and inviting friends, I never received the promised rewards. It seems like a tactic to get more users without actually delivering on their offers. Be cautious if you're considering downloading this app.",1,18/11/2022
horrible they got my return I have the label receipt from UPS and they said they did not get ot and stayed with my money. Now im in a DISPUTE with credit card and UPS. DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE. plus I was researching and their clothe is made from RECYCLED OLD CLOTHE. VERY DANGEROUS,1,18/11/2022

"I've bought from Temu maybe 7-8 times over two years and haven't had any trouble. I really like some of the stuff, some is not so good. But is Temu a scam or rip off?  NoMy wife really likes the black metal decorative silhouettes, they are well done are now all over the house. Just be realistic with your expectations. You simply aren't going to buy a $7 VOA meter that is going to be in the same quality ballpark as one that costs 20X-30X as much. But if you want a really cheap one that will work for a while---. I bought a $1.50 battery tester that works perfectly for the purpose.And be aware that it will take a couple of weeks.I use my desktop not a phone app and haven't had problems with my credit card.",5,19/11/2022

"Temu is a bit of hit and miss when it comes to the quality of a product.  I ordered some earrings, and a few of them arrived broken.  Temu wanted me to upload a picture to prove they were damaged.  Annoying.  I don't have time for that and then have to wait while they decide if I deserve a refund.  I just threw the earrings away.  Sometimes they give you a partial refund and allow you to keep a product, but who wants to keep a damaged product????",3,20/11/2022

"I?€?m basing this on 2 things , and would say to anyone who wants to part with there hard earnt cash to do the same first regardless of who it is . I always look at the negative responses even if a company or busy has a high positive one . To see what others are complaining about . If the topics are the same and fair then I?€?m cautious. I also look for if the company has bother to reply and if they have taken the time to actually write a reply that?€?s not repeated every few replies , aka just change a few words and copy and paste it .",1,21/11/2022
"Temu are Scammers! Beware of This Company!I am writing this review to warn everyone about the fraudulent practices of Temu. They are scammers! I received the wrong product multiple times, and I have finally decided to stop using their services and demand that my data be deleted from their system.As a journalist from the Netherlands living in Bulgaria, I rely on online shopping for many products needed for my house and my AirBNB, the Cactus House. However, Temu has proven to be unreliable and untrustworthy. For instance, they shipped me a sign that was supposed to say ""Cactus House"" but instead said ""Cactus Hou,"" which is completely unacceptable.Their return policy is another nightmare. They use Speedy for delivery but a completely different and obscure company for returns. This return location isn't even listed on Google Maps! I spent an entire day trying to return a product, driving 30 minutes to the nearest town, Radnevo, and wasting my time and money. Why can't they use the same parcel company for returns that they use for deliveries?To make matters worse, they had the audacity to tell me that I am only receiving a full refund because I ordered so many products from them. This is illegal and against European Union consumer laws. New customers who receive faulty products should be entitled to a full refund as well.I recieved this message:Advanced refund for return has been issued by Temu. It is available in your Temu credit balanceBecause of your good shopping history, we initiated a full refund for 2 items when you dropped off your return package. We have issued your refund. This is an advanced refund. lf we don't receive the return items, we may charge your original payment method.So meaning if you are not a good customer as claimed by Temu you cant get a refund!I am extremely angry and plan to file a complaint with the EU in Brussels. Additionally, I will be making a video and posting it on social media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Rumble, Instagram, X, and more. People need to be warned about this company's practices.I will keep you updated on my case against Temu.Stay away from Temu!",1,21/11/2022

"Great Selection, But Beware of Deceptive *** Practices Temu offers a wide selection of products at good prices, which would be enough to attract shoppers. However, the app is riddled with clickbait ""free"" items and obnoxious games that make you think a prize is just around the corner, only to change the odds or trick you into referring your social circle. This app isn't made for an American audience that prefers clear, straightforward deals without all the misleading animations and fake They believe the American audience Is  Ignorant and  do not understand the Feikin odds and gifts",1,22/11/2022
"Just can't stand the shopping experience, so I never place an order. The spinning wheel,  the app only restriction, the pushiness of buying things you don't want or need to get free delivery. Will never shop TEMU. Wish their annoying ads would disappear.",1,22/11/2022

This company is hit or miss ok they give you credit for late delivery but when they deliver half the rubbish its crap and its a nightmare to return ive brought jewellary and they wont refund unless you return even though it turns black after 2 days avoid big time,1,22/11/2022
"Pros: I have always received my orders and get tracking info until it arrives. Some products are excellent value, some mediocre and some basically junk however for the price the latter are offered at you would not expect high quality. I have bought at least three to four really quality items that were exceptionally well priced and work really well. Cons: inundated with email promotions (which I unsubscribed from) and any clothing items are almost always polyester (poor) even though they might look attractive. I will continue to deal with them when I see something I really like or want but it's easy to get into a shopping frenzy and I think that is what they are seeking to get you into with all the emails and coupons, Fortunately I have sales resistance!",3,22/11/2022
"First I have noticed a great price hike. Was to be expected to get you hooked. I have ordered a lot of things from them and honestly some have been great! That was in the beginning. Now I have noticed huge price increases and items are getting less quality. They had a good thing going but now it is touch and go for me. I still will try new things but if I keep having to return no way as I don't see the returns being honored at all. Trying to express where is the return is almost impossible. And if you do it is never clear on how it is applied. So, I don't really recommend as I first did. I guess buyer beware.",2,22/11/2022
"I love Temu, but right now I can?€?t pay for my order. All my cards have been replaced all have all new numbers and I need them all removed from my account or you will lose me as a customer.",1,22/11/2022
Poor quality products inaccurately described. Takes long to get here as well.,1,22/11/2022
Absolutely terrible got my first order thought a bit crap then thought I would try again after being told for 2 days it was out for delivery It finally arrived and I was right another load of badly made trash I would never buy from these again if it looks too god to be true it definitely is stay clear of Temu rubbish rubbish rubbish,1,22/11/2022
"I'm honestly really surprised at the negative reviews on here, as I order very regularly from Temu and am always satisfied. If I have been dissatisfied with an item for any reason temu have refunded immediately and usually allow me to keep the item. When I have returned items that don't fit they sent the return code and refunded promptly. Most items are excellent value,  usually cheaper than Amazon. Delivery usually takes approximately a week and a half, which is fine. Always given tracking updates and a definite delivery deadline. The only annoying thing is all the pop ups saying you have coupons etc, as you then have to buy more items! It's sometimes hard to resist ???? Lots of unusual items, but sometimes the pictures do look much better than the actual item received.  However,  I do lots of art and crafts and everything I have bought have been perfect at a fraction of the price I would have to pay in Hobbycraft! I'll continue shopping with Temu and hopefully my great experiences will continue.",5,22/11/2022
I am not happy at all with the products I received today all is cheap crap plastic. I am not waisting my time to return it all will go in the bin.,1,22/11/2022
I ordered something from Temu a few days ago. Since then I've been inundated with marketing emails. Until I receive my goods and find everything is in good order I am highly unlikely to order anything else. Also the marketing emails seem to be offering outstanding deals but Im of the opinion if it sounds too good to be true it often is. Until I receive my order and confirm the goods are fit for purpose I will not be responding to any marketing emails and may even unsubscribe.

ORDERED A BED FOR MY DAOUGHTER, after unpacking and starting assembly we found many missing hardware and defective parts, been chasing TEMU for nearly 2 months to supply the missing parts or send someone to haul this POS away! my daughter's room was occupied by this pile of junk for over a month and she had to sleep in the guest room while we keep getting generic emails about how TEMU is trying to find a resolution with the merchant! im a disabled combat veteran, had to finally give up, pay a couple of kids to break this junk and haul it away so my daughter can have her room back! im out $400 on the item, $200 on the guys hauling it away and HOURS upon HOURS of time and blood pleasure waisted!",1,22/11/2022

"Mixed bag. I have recently turned to Temu in my search for affordable online shopping and interesting items from the predominantly Asian market. So far so good in terms of expected pricing and products. Not always the best quality, but that comes with the territory with these types of apps, the item is hit or miss, but what annoys me is all the ""promos"" you get inundated with texts/emails/pop ups (when in the app) for deals and ""Coupons"" that never really seem to be available also don't like when discounts only apply to a single item rather than the whole cart.  I haven't been so disappointed as to stop using, but definitely not impressed enough that I would recommend anyone use it without some serious skepticism.",3,23/11/2022

"This dodgy company hires cashback promoters like Topcashback and Quidco to promote the business by offering bonus and cashback to customers. But in the end, this company (Temu) DOES NOT pay the rewards. Such a dodgy company doesn't deserve any business at all. I never have any issues with the promotion cashback with Ali Express UK. Shame on you, Temu!!! I will never buy from your website again!Response to TEMU's reply: I have already chatted with your team online yesterday regarding this declined cashback and bonus (??11.13 in total). Your team refused to help. I made it clear to your team that I WILL NOT BUY from Temu again. Dodgy company, it should be banned and shut down in the UK!! A warning to everyone: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DISGRACEFUL COMPANY!!!",1,23/11/2022

"I ordered 2 of the following item:  ""Universal Adjustable 360?? Rotation GPS Cell Phone Holder - Waterproof Wall Mount Stand with PC Material - Easy View Rear Mirror Mount for Safe Driving"" The description says, ""fits all vehicles.""  I got one put together - not easy, but possible without coherent instructions.  There is also a video on the TEMU site.  But is is called ""installation"" not ""assembly.""  I assembled one of the cell phone holders, and tried to install it on my rearview mirror - but it doesn't fit at all so cannot be installed.  I tried it on our 2nd car and had the same experience.  I have been on the Temu website for more than an hour trying to communicate (by chat, through the ""support"" portal, and by trying to give all the pertinent details of the problem several different ways.  I am very frustrated, and of course, disappointed that the cell phone holder which I wanted to use while looking at GPS navigation, will not work for me, AND confused about why this particular order does not show up in my ""order list"" on the TEMU list.

Very impressed with the service but sorry could not keep the cushions as they were good quality and very reasonably priced. Will definitely use this company in the future.",5,28/11/2022
I returned some items from different orders and it says the package has been delivered to the facility. It takes 1-3 days to arrive at the warehouse but its been over a week and it's still at the facility apparently. I think temu may have lost the package and refusing to refund me until they check the package for quality inspection. How can they check something which they have lost? How long am I expected to wait?I contacted customer services who were absolutely terrible. Swerves the questions that are being asked. On top of that there is no contact number to speak to anyone. Absolutely appalled at the level of service recieved by temu.,1,28/11/2022

No that's not true: They ""reviewed"" the order and decided it was legit. With my 15 year old daughters card, to an unknown recipient.

I ordered 10 items and within the delivery I received two items I had never ordered. In addition to this I never received two items I ordered.  This is the second time this is happening to me with Temu. You pay for items you never ordered and you don't get some of the ones you ordered. It is like a lottery. I am never using them again.,2,30/11/2022
A TERRIBLE COMPANY. HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND AFTER RETURNING ITEM. THEY REFUSED ME OTHER REFUNDS BY CLAIMING THEY COULD ONLY GIVE A PARTIAL REFUND. I AM ENTITLED TO MY MONEY BACK.

"UPDATED BELOW I did receive couch pieces eventually but here is my original post: Ordered a couch. They have only sent half of it. They claim that if I want the rest of it, I have to RETURN this box that weighs more than I do and have it reshipped, or take a partial refund of 141 dollars. Neither of these options is a viable solution. The CORRECT SOLUTION is th contact the seller and  have them SHIP THE MISSONG PARTS!!! DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY ANYTHING LARGE OR PRICEY FROM TEMU. You WILL regret doing it. IF I ever recieve the missing components, I'll update this  review. It's a nice couch, but half a couch just doesn't cut it for $420. UPDATE: The couch has arrived. Turns out it was sent in three shipments. This was never mentioned though. When this is necessary, the customer NEEEDS TO KNOW. AND RECIEVE TRSCKING NUMBERS ON ALL THREE  PACKAGES.Temu, Americans don't deal well with spending large amounts and being left in the dark. We don't do business like that. Another thing you need to change is all the snake in the grass fake discounts we have to fight our way through even if we just want to browse  the site. It's clearly fake, there is  no game of chance to your spinning wheels, they are a video played for everyone who  goes to your site or the app. It's nonsense. We can also see that you mark up the prices on ""discounted goods"" to where there is no real discount. These things make you seem untrustworthy. When I told friends that I was buying a couch from Temu they were afraid I'd end up with a miniature version of the couch and thought I was crazy to trust you with a large purchase. It's because you fake out the items you sell to look nicer than what they are, and bigger than reality, and your fake discounts, and of course we all did the feed fish until you die scam to get a coupon only good for a day or two AND ONLY USABLE if you spend MORE MONEY. BE HONEST. BE TRUSTWORTHY. That will give you longevity more so than trying to scam us into believing lies. All that does is drop satisfaction rates, and prevent people from buying larger items. Even with the couches there are adds that show full sectionals but when you READ IT, it's actually a 2 seat love seat for that price NOT a sectional. We shouldn't have to reread adds 12 times to be dang sure it's not a trick. That's crap business standards. Do better. I love what you offer, but you're low business ethic is a serious turn off to all Americans. To the point of it being a joke.",3,30/11/2022

I absolutely love Temu. I have never had a bad experience regarding items purchased. I have ordered so many clothes and they are ALL really good quality and well finished.  By comparison the same items bought elsewhere would cost four times as much.The clothing is beautiful and so many designs to choose from.I have been buying from Temu for months and will continue to do so in the future.  You have a minimum spend of ??15 to get free shipping and I find it is easy to spend more than that each time as the prices are crazy and unbelievable! I recommend sizing up and checking the measurements given for each item before you purchase as they tend to come up smaller than British sizes. Great company and great service..no problems with deliveries or drivers..all very pleasant. I highly recommend this company and they are definitely NOT a scam.,5,01/12/2022
"They seem to have mastered upselling by issuing you a credit on an item but impose a minimum to use that credit. They are the best at bait and switch. I had an entire order cancelled and they automatically put it as a Temu credit rather than original payment form. They should be banned from selling in the United States. Most of the products I?€?ve ordered were really good, but God forbid you have a problem with an item you?€?re sunk. They?€?re making their money keeping your money. Every time I order there?€?s a problem with an item or two. You take the credit but then they impose minimum orders and if it?€?s shipping from the United States they charge shipping. They can keep my credit. I will no longer play into their forced upselling.",1,01/12/2022

I'm so disappointed in customer service I've never really been happy happy with the products that I've ordered they're okay you get what you pay for I guess. A lot of the pictures of the products are misleading and deceitful. And they ask you to play this game farmland or fish land to win your free items they almost insist you pick free items I've been playing that damn game for almost a year now and have never received free item have ordered lots of stuff from them and never received a benefit of a free gift of any kind. Have a minimum order of $20 or you can't submit an order. So I called customer service and spoke with some woman who obviously was new. I asked them what they did to make a dissatisfied customer happy she politely said we suggest you continue to share our app with your friends on Facebook and get more invitations and order more. So I'm supposed to continue playing this game for another God knows how long and during that time keep ordering from them and sending them new customers when they won't even honor a free gift for someone who shot with them religiously. I'm uninstalling the app and we'll be telling everybody I know what a ripoff is everyone that I've shared with on Facebook I will definitely go back and post on Facebook that I'm sorry. Sorry be weary people if you're looking for a cool place to shop online look somewhere else,1,02/12/2022

I discovered Temu a couple of months ago. I have had five orders from them. I have NEVER been disappointed and am very pleased with their service. The items arrived very fast (I live on the West Coast so it is probably longer if you live in the East) One thing that I really notice is that I see the same items on Amazon for much more. I don't know if it is because I am getting it from the manufacturer or the markup or the tariffs or whatever but they certainly have some great bargains. Also as a plus size woman I can get the most beautiful clothes for under 30. that fit me perfectly. The fabrics and stitching are all fine and they wash up great. I have no complaints at all about Temu.,5,03/12/2022
None of the transactions I placed through Quidco are being authorised. Have placed a lot of orders and the bonus makes it more appealing. Without these being authorised by Temu makes the experience pointless so no longer use Temu,1,03/12/2022

"I'll give Temu 5 star's with the hopes that both of my orders make it to me. You see, I'm not sure who's delivering to me. I live in Edmonton Alberta Canada so there's lots of different delivery services available. But Temu doesn't say who it will be. Plus when I ordered, there was no place in the address part that I could add my buzzer box code. And that's a problem because my name isn't on my buzzer box. So I can only hope that whoever is delivering can somehow make it into my building. So I guess I need to wait on pins and needles to see if I get what I paid for. You didn't answer my question, the question I need answered. Plus; I haven't received anything yet. Please read my initial comment and answer. Who delivers your items in my area?

Product not at all what it was shown to be - ordered coasters that showed a corked bottom and laminated design - they came and were cut plastic with the design cheaply stamped on.

They used Evri which is normally good, but the driver was totally untrustworthy, showing twice a picture with the parcel in his hands, but you cannot see where he is!!! Its almost laughable, the stupidity .. however, they might work like that with instructions from Temu, because a lot of customers would let it go, as the products are cheap. Not me though and I ll report both companies to UK Trading Standards for possible customer fraud. PS I requested a refund which was extremely confusing to process, on purpose I guess... but I wasted so much time on the order, selecting the products and so on. We also stayed at home both days when the parcels were to arrive... Do not waste your time and money please!!!! I will never ever order from them, a, totally fraudulent company, plse read through the 100 s of reviews saying exactly the same!! This fraud must be REPORTED.",1,04/12/2022

Worse shopping experience of my life I was daft enough to order of a 100 pound of items to fined with In days the items iver did turn on no more or was broken so I could use them agine contact temu and got no help in any way I live chat with them thay asked if I didn't send it back thay would give a partial refund to be insulted as that partial was only for 3 pounds it's a big scam and with in days money was taken out of my account for no reason at all over 35 contracted them and that did know why I found out on line there sell your card details it's a big scam  buyers be warned run to the hills and don't contact temu as if you contact them  you will be wasting your time terrible customer did ready any of replay to them or listen to my problem I warned them I would add a review on trust pilot thay couldn't be bothered I was so upset after the conversation I will never shop with them agine IV seen your reply IV done that what you have asked and you offered me a partial refund instead of sending you I told you about my mental health battles as I shop online as I don't leave my home so I could return if I tried but you offer me a partial refund my order was over 50 pound and the partial refund was only 3 pound I don't know how you work that 3 pound is a big insult that's not even harth back if you are doing this to all your customers it's a big scam,1,04/12/2022

I ordered for the first time.  Temu payment system changed my address.  Packages delivered to wrong address and they are not willing to fix their mistake. I would not recommend.,1,05/12/2022
Their electronics for very low quality even though didn't expect great quality it's real bad. The pictures and descriptions are very misleading. I've ordered 3 different things that aren't worth using.,2,05/12/2022
"If I could give a negative star I would!!  Temu is a rip ??ff!!  My daughter was placing an order last night and hit pay before realizing that the credit card on file with them was mine and not her's.  She immediately seen her mistake and hit cancel order within 10 minutes of placing the order. To late!! They withdrew almost 400.00 from my account and only refunded 200 and something back into my account!!  Didn't package anything,  didn't ship anything, didn't do anything and kept 100 and something dollars !!!!  No explanation either as to why they kept so much of my money.  BUYERS BEWARE!!!  They will rip you off !!",1,05/12/2022
"My order was not received. It was shipped via FedEx. I confirmed with FedEx that Temu shipped to the wrong address and wrong name. FedEx provided one picture of the delivery, and Temu provided a different picture. Neither one showed my home.Temu advertises a ""No Delivery Guarantee."" As of this moment in time, they are refusing to honor it. I have reviously done quite a bit of business with them. But, now that I know I cannot trust them to do the right thing, I will no longer order from them.",1,05/12/2022
What i like about temu is there diverse product inventory. I know its 75% rubbish products that last a day at most and unfortunately comes from China and similar countries so i don't expect it to be quality. its a disposable product that's on offer. The sing that bothers me is the descriptions of the products are very vague and short and not descriptive enough.,3,05/12/2022
Don't do it. Terrible experience so far. Misleading shipping estimation.  Communication through bots + so much spam through email & WhatsApp. I was hopeful- I read some positive reviews here & decided to try. Don't do it.,1,06/12/2022

WHAT AN UTTER DISGRACE OF A COMPANY AND HAMSTER WHEEL OF THE BELOW PAR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!ORDER ARRIVED AND THE PACKAGING WAS DAMAGED DURING TRANSIT WITH SEVERAL ITEMS MISSING.I SENT PHOTOS OF THIS TO TEMU WHO THEN REFUSED MY REFUND AS THE ORDER WAS 'DELIVERED' THEN TICKET CLOSED. THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM WAS THE MISSING ITEMS. THEN I GO BACK ON THE HAMSTER WHEEL OF THE CHAT SERVICE TO GO OVER THE SAME THING TO HAVE ANOTHER TICKET OPENED THEN CLOSED AS ORDER WAS PACKAGED CORRECTLY! AGAIN NOT THE ISSUE. THE ISSUE WAS DAMAGE DURING TRANSIT.I THEN AGAIN GO BACK ON THE HAMSTER WHEEL OF OVER 1 HOUR ON CHAT TO HAVE ANOTHER CHAT OPENED THEN CLOSED AS 'ORDER DELIVERED'ALL REQUESTS TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER ARE IGNORED. NO ONE SEEMS TO LISTEN OR WANT TO HELP. HOURS IVE WASTED ON THIS HAMSTER WHEEL GOING AROUND AND AROUND GETTING NOWHERE.IVE NO DOUBT TEMU RESPONSE TO THIS REVIEW WILL BE FULL OF APOLOGIES AND ASKING ME TO CONTACT THEM THROUGH CHAT!! CLEARLY THEY DONT READ MESSAGES OR COMPLAINTS AS THEY WOULD KNOW THAT THIS CHAT SYSTEM IS THE ISSUE AND IS MADE EXTREMELY HARD FOR CUSTOMERS TO GET SUPPORT.THIS WILL BE MY LAST ORDER WITH TEMU** UPDATE 20.07.24 825AMEXACTLY AS I EXPECTED FROM TEMU!! MY PROBLEM ALL ALONG WITH THEM IS THEY DO NOT LISTEN OR READ MESSAGES/EMAILS.IF THEY DID THEY WOULD KNOW IT IS NOT A CASE THAT THE ITEMS ARRIVED DAMAGED OR NOT AS DESCRIBED!! THEY ARE MISSING FROM MY ORDER DUE TO THE OUTER PACKAGING BEING DAMAGED DURING TRANSIT!CLICKING 'REFUND' TAKES ME ON THE CONTINUAL HAMSTER WHEEL AS DESCRIBED IN MY INITIAL COMPLAINT OF 19.07.24 WITH ALL REQUESTS BEING DECLINED BY TEMU AS THE ORDER WAS 'DELIVERED' TO A BIN I MAY ADD.

"I've placed a few orders from Temu, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. Each order arrived right on time, which is always a plus. The quality of the blouses is amazing; they feel great and look even better. I do hope Temu expands their selection of cotton clothes, as I prefer natural fabrics.Additionally, the kids' clothing designs are fantastic! My daughter absolutely loves them. Overall, Temu offers great products and reliable service, making it a go-to for our clothing needs. Highly recommend!",5,07/12/2022

"I have ordered 3 times from Temu & have been very satisfied with everything (no electronics). The quality is very good for the price, some items I had previously ordered from Amazon & there was no difference in the quality. The delivery has been fair, around 5 - 8 days & they update you at every stage of the journey. I find ordering clothes online a bit risky but after reading the reviews I am going to take a chance & order some tops.I would definitely recommend this company.",5,08/12/2022
"Dishonest and not much better that scammers. While placing an order I wanted to order 3 of something but it only registered as 1. So I tried again to order the 2 and still it would not register the so I was forced to register the 3 individually. I also wanted to order a floor rug which it accepted. So believing I had ordered 3 of the item wanted and the rug I then proceeded to check out. Check out said I had ordered the 3 item twice. I cancelled the order to start again. In the mean time it had registered as ordered. I proceeded to replace the first bungled order. The bottom line was I paid $196.46 for the order I wanted but they also took out a further $112.47 for the cancelled order. To try and rectify this extra amount by contacting service centre they asked me to explain everything over and over, they asked the most irrelevant questions. I am sending the file to the ACCC.",1,08/12/2022

"What a scam. They hammer you with discount and promotion adds. And presents their products as the top quality. Until you receive them, what a shock. I have used Temu in 2023 and didn?€?t like the quality so I deleted the app. Earlier this month thought to give it another go, Ordered four items. Parcel arrived after a week. One item is totally missing. The rest straight to return mode. I will never use this platform again. I wish I can submit pictures here just to show everyone how the product look like on the site and what I actually receive. NEVER",1,08/12/2022
Ordered July 2023.. sent back. Had proof. No refund. Received items back in the post today!! A year later saying return period closed!??? Disgusting customer service. Avoid! Sent back due to dress looking so cheap like an old curtain. Sandals .. well more like a flip flop with bow. Sticking to other online site as their customer service and returns procedure is second to none  Please don?€?t ask me to contact you. I did that last year. You told me to be patient and I would be refunded - nothing. I hope others read all these negative comments and steer clear from Temu (rip offs),1,08/12/2022
"My order is missing and this company refuses to refund or resend the parcel. They insist that it was delivered but I dont have it. The experience is horrible. The texts are system generated, its not human like. Bad customer service Horrible shopping experience",1,08/12/2022
"What makes Temu so great to deal with is their no-quibble returns policy. You simply print out the returns label and drop it off at a drop-off point. Super easy. They also have a price adjustment policy, which means that they'll refund the difference in price is the item you bought goes down in price. The only two gripes I have are:1. Their packaging is really poor quality. They always ship in poly bags, which means that fragile items get damaged. Ordering birthday cards, etc., is a complete waste of time as they will arrive bent and destroyed. Such a shame really. It's also annoying if you want to order a gift for someone as the box it comes in will be destroyed.2. It takes a long time for their packages to arrive.Overall, Temu is WAY better than AliExpress. As AliExpress's customer service continues to nose-dive at an alarming rate, Temu really is the safer option. Even if it does take a few days longer, at least you that, unlike AliExpress, no one will try and rip you off.Reply to Temu: I know I can return items, thanks. That's why I like using your services. I was referring to the packaging you use for shipping fragile items or things like cards, which should be shipped in rigid packaging. I also think your shipping is a bit slow - 2-3 weeks os a lot. I'm just giving you feedback on the things you could improve on.",4,09/12/2022

Placed 1st order abt a week ago- received countless e mails offering further big discounts saying ?€?sorry we messed up?€? but no goods . Their system says it was delivered 17 July am while I was here but U do not have the goods . The signed name is NOT hiw I would sign so either delivered to wrong house or this is a scam.

Will never buy again from this site I?€?ve bought many times before i ordered a hose on reel dhl delivered to the wrong house and took a picture in my area somewhere i showed them proof that it wasn?€?t my house but they still said it was delivered and denied me a refund dhl delivered to a big house mine is a bungalow that house had a brown door mine has a green door i will never trust Temu again with my money i will tell everyone I no not to risk buying from this site because as long as the delivery driver drops it off in the area that means it was delivered they believed the delivery company over me after I showed them proof and still sided with the delivery company,1,09/12/2022

"Don't use their ""events"" as it is just a scam.  When I spun the wheel, it said I had two free gifts and gave me a list of items to choose from.  I met the requirements but instead of getting gifts all I got were low value coupons.  I tried to resolve this but no success",1,09/12/2022
"I ordered two items. One arrived and, at the time, I assumed that the second was coming separately. Life got busy and I forgot about the second item for a few weeks. When I remembered it, I went to check my order and it said it was in the first delivery. It definitely was not in the box. Temu's ridiculous policy is that you need to take a picture of the box and the contents in order to receive a return. The box was long gone, and what does that prove anyway? Someone could just take an item out before taking the picture. Anyway, customer service denied a refund because they said they ""verified with the warehouse and confirmed"" that both items were packed and shipped. Of course, they did not send me a photo of both items in the box at the warehouse.",1,09/12/2022

"Price for the same item is different many times simultaneously on the site. Their 90% bonus deals are scams. The latest scam is that their usual minimum order of $15 is now being split at the checkout into two random separate parts so that one part falls below $15 and you now have to add more items to make up the minimum split order. After you confirm an order don't be surprised that an item is designated to be sent ""by ship"" and the wait is three months for a suitcase. Some items are just so crappy you have to just toss them in the garbage. Their return and refund policy is another scam.",2,10/12/2022

The Ad for Temu Cleary stated a 5-piece patio set with 1 square table and 4 chairs. I used the chat for Temu to verify this was what I would be receiving. They read the AD back to me and had me request a call back from customer services. I spoke to someone who informed me that he was in another country and that I would receive my chairs. The bottom-line package arrived with no chairs; now I am stuck with a table and no chairs. I asked for the corporate office and was told they were busy and could not talk to me. I will continue to call and complain until compensation for my chairs. People do yourself a favor and stick with Amazon who have never treated a customer like this. I have friends who shop here I have called everyone and shared this awful experience I had with this company Temu. This is a true story take heed and do not shop at Temu.,1,10/12/2022

I came across Temu looking for gold buttons that were just too expensive in haberdashery and decide to try it with a little order, shoe soles and artistic brushes and minor kitchen stuff. The order arrived fast and in time, 11 days to Italy. I was consistently informed . Since then I made two more orders but you have to use your brain on what articles could go wrong and therefore not buy them. I avoid electronics.

"This company is little more than a scam. After you order something they inform you that it will take 4-6 weeks (in my case) to deliver your order. It then transpires that the item is coming from the other side of the globe to reach you (via Turkestan and Lithuania!!) with no regard for carbon footprint. They bombard you with meaningless platitudes and worthless ?€?special offers?€? and refuse to refund you when you eventually get so fed up of their shallow incompetence. I have now raised a chargeback dispute with my bank, blocked notifications and emails from Temu and removed the App. I will have nothing more to do with them and I suggest you do the same. Update: just look at the reply from Temu! That?€?s what you would be up against folks! Nothing more helpful than standardised ?€?Bot?€? responses.

I also asked about getting some kind of compensation for the inconvenience and was told they can't do that,  unfortunately I don't believe that as I have had this before. Temu customer service representative kept saying sorry and apologize for the inconvenience this has caused me,  but was unwilling to do anything to rectify the situation. I would like Temu to know that actions,  speak louder than words and when a customer asks to be connected to a supervisor,  they should be able to speak to one.I find Temu does not make their customers a priority,  it is all about the money to them.  We are spending our money with Temu and should be Temu's number 1 priority,  because without customers there wouldn't be any need for Temu. I asked for contact information,  but was also told that the only way I could contact Temu is through the chat option,  this I find absolutely appalling.",1,13/12/2022

Despite this, my order was marked as delivered by the shipping company, Sameday, which has received numerous negative reviews (1.4 rating from over 893 users) for falsely marking orders as delivered.Instead of addressing my concerns and escalating the matter to the delivery company for proof of delivery, Eve Swift has been responding with generic and unhelpful automated messages. Her so-called ""investigation"" concluded within 30 minutes, stating that the order was delivered without any further evidence or consideration of my situation. This lack of genuine customer support and failure to take appropriate actions is unacceptable for someone in her supervisory position.I am requesting Temu management to thoroughly review the interactions in ticket 1719503410032577 and address this issue appropriately. If my concerns are not resolved, I will proceed with filing a complaint with the European Commission Center (ECC) and pursue legal action to ensure my consumer rights are upheld.I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to this matter by refunding me the full amount I have paid especially that I did not receive my order.Ticket number: 1719503410032577Order Number: PO-032-04941629281912528",1,13/12/2022

So the items was sent to Temu warehouse. advised them on same day of dropping the parcel that the items in the parcel they will receive do not belong to them and asked them to resend to sender. 2 weeks later nothing heard so contacted them again. Then was told that the ticket closed and they cannot send those items sent to by mistake!!!! They just told me they are keeping the items that don?€?t belong to them?€? which is never heard of !! UPDATE??? I have messaged your chat team millions of times and it turned out just waste of time! Was going to lodge a complaint with Fair Trading but couldn?€?t locate your ABN!

I have made arrangements to return these however this seems an ordeal in itself. I'm disgusted in the quality of the shoes. Let's just see if and when the cost of these is refunded. Will not be ordering again.",2,14/12/2022
"UPDATE:  Our complaint is now with the escalation team, so we will wait to see whether they can improve their chaotic delivery system.UPDATE:  We have received the standard wording from Temu, but this does NOT address our issues.  Of the 60 orders we have placed since 2 May, 47% (due between 28 June and 17 July) have not arrived.  Only 15% of orders have arrived on time and in one delivery; 35% were late and most of those were split into multiple deliveries (as many as 5 per order).  It's chaotic and all Temu are doing is to offer ??4 for each order that's delayed.  This is not how Temu operated when we first started ordering with them and this is no way to run a business and keep customers happy...We are long-term customers of Temu, as we regularly place orders for our charity.  Recently the delivery system has become quite chaotic.  We never know when items are going to arrive; and the orders are being split into lots of small packages which makes it very complicated to keep track of what's arrived and what's outstanding.  The quality of items is also inconsistent and often smaller sizes than ordered are being shipped out.  Temu offer ??4 credit for late delivery, but this is not sufficient to make up for the delay in receiving items and the additional time it takes to work out what's going on.  We expect better service than this and proper quality control checks.",1,14/12/2022

"I was really skeptical about Temu first, but it has beat my expections in prices, shipping and after sales support (refunds when problems arise). I bought a number of small items - u have to scan the products more carefully than u would on amazon because the reviews are curated, But, i havent lost money or landed with low quality product since Temu quickly gave me a refund whenever there was a problem.I hope Temu becomes a American company at some point in future. I love Amazon and Walmart, but we need more competition.",5,14/12/2022
"I received an email from Temu, all it said was ?€?we apologise?€? I asked what they were apologising for. All I got was an answer to another question that I had not raised. Absolute bunch of fools. I fear the products I have ordered will not arrive and dread the thought of trying to get them to understand the problem. Best to give them a miss.",1,14/12/2022
"Don't ever waste your time buying anything from Temu, this is an unreliable ridiculous company. I have always purchased from Amazon without ever having a problem. However this time I thought I would give Temu my business to purchase an air conditioner at the same price as Amazon because Temu offered free shipping. What a big mistake! I kept getting strange phone calls from Massachusetts the lady kept saying she was from Temu but would not give me any information on my order and kept asking me what I purchased. Because she refused to verify any information I thought it was a scam call. I had also in the meantime received a scam email from Temu that I had won something. So I called Temu directly and the lady told me that my order was now verified and everything was moving forward, only for me to find out on my own when I went to tracking a few days later that they had canceled my order without notifying me. The reason they stated online for the cancelation was because of unusual payment activity which is absurd since I had checked my Mastercard account the following day after placing the order and it was pending. The reason I'm so upset is my wife is very ill and I needed the air conditioner as soon as possible because of the brutally hot weather. I wasted 5 days with Temu. So I went ahead as always and bought from Amazon with no issues with the exact same MasterCard as usual. Never again will I ever buy anything from Temu what an unprofessional stupid company!  The response below back from Temu is a lame response with absolutely no explanation or taking of responsibility.  Therefore unacceptable. And no I'm never doing business with them ever again nor would I recommend them to anyone.",1,14/12/2022
"Never again. Ordered several electronic goods. Everything send in a paper/plastic packing. All boxes inside were damaged. Amongst this a solar panel. Not sure if it is damaged during transport, but after one hour in sun my phone had discarged 10% instead of charging. Then another product, a 40 watt multi charger. It charge, but slower than my 5 watt that came with the phone. On Temu homepage both products (actually all their products) gets brilliant reviews, which is unbelievable compared to the reviews elsewhere.

I ordered from this company a few times and it was hit or miss type of thing. Some of the merchandise is cheaply made that?€?s the reason for their cheap prices.

It was the same thing they will say please be patience it?€?s on the way and I was. Then they gave me invalid tracking number @ this point I was fed up. So I reach out to my bank and told them what was going on and I had the proofs to back up my statement. Temu then notified me told me to drop the claim. Which I didn?€?t anyway they got upset so now I don?€?t have my package or money. What ended up happening was they stop the process of the package and won?€?t return my money. But I have the bank to take care of that. Will not ever order from this company. I just order within the states.,1,16/12/2022

I've made 2 different orders with Temu and am in the process of making another order currently. The items I've received are good quality and it takes about a week to get your order. I've returned items from my orders and could either choose credit or money returned. I've choose credit both times because I knew I would make another order. The prices for a lot of items are the cheapest I've seen for the item which is nice since everything is so expensive anymore. Good items at a great price.,5,16/12/2022

Awesome quality and dont misshape when washed as almost most more expensive store bought clothing. I've had household items such as storage shelving units.

"Temu is an online marketplace that I once believed offered great deals and a variety of products, but my experience quickly proved otherwise. Initially, the platform seemed promising with its wide range of goods at incredibly low prices. I placed several orders, excited about the potential savings. However, the excitement turned into frustration as the weeks went by with no sign of my purchases. The delivery times were excruciatingly long, and when the packages finally arrived, they were nothing short of disappointing. The quality of the products was far below what was advertised, with many items being poorly made or entirely different from the descriptions and images on the website. Some items never even showed up, leaving me out of pocket with no recourse.Determined to resolve these issues, I reached out to Temu's customer support, expecting a quick resolution. Unfortunately, this experience only deepened my conviction that Temu was a scam. The chat support was designed to be a convenient way to handle customer inquiries, but in reality, it was a series of automated responses that did nothing to address my concerns. Each interaction felt like I was talking to a machine rather than a human being. The responses were generic, repetitive, and often irrelevant to the specific issues I was facing. For instance, when I inquired about missing items, I received scripted replies about standard delivery times and was repeatedly asked to wait longer. Even when I managed to get past the initial automated replies, the live agents provided little help. They promised investigations and follow-ups that never materialized. Each chat session ended with assurances that my case would be prioritized, but nothing changed. Weeks turned into months without any resolution.In one particularly frustrating incident, I received a damaged product and sought a refund or replacement. The chat support agent assured me that a replacement would be sent out immediately. However, after waiting for another month, I reached out again only to be told that no such request had been logged in my account. This cycle of broken promises and lack of accountability was infuriating. The customer support agents seemed trained to deflect and delay rather than provide real solutions. They would often disconnect the chat abruptly, forcing me to start the entire process over again with a new agent who was equally unhelpful.The tipping point came when I tried to escalate my complaints. Despite numerous attempts, I could not get in touch with a supervisor or anyone with the authority to make decisions. It became clear that the chat support was a facade, designed to give the illusion of customer service without actually providing any. The supposed 'live chat' was a loop of pre-written scripts and disingenuous reassurances that led nowhere. I also noticed that many of the positive reviews on the website seemed fake, likely posted to lure unsuspecting customers into the same trap I fell into.Feeling deceived and out of options, I turned to consumer forums and social media to share my experience. To my surprise, I found countless others with similar stories of frustration and loss. It was evident that Temu's business model relied on misleading advertising and subpar customer service to exploit customers. The lack of transparency and the deliberate obfuscation by their chat support reinforced the perception of Temu as a scam.In conclusion, my experience with Temu was a stark lesson in the dangers of too-good-to-be-true deals and the importance of reliable customer service. The platform's failure to deliver on its promises, coupled with the ineffectiveness and deceit of its chat support, highlighted a systemic issue within the company. For anyone considering shopping on Temu, I would strongly advise against it. The apparent savings are not worth the risk of poor quality products, endless delays, and a customer service system that seems designed to frustrate and deceive rather than assist. Temu may present itself as a haven for bargain hunters, but my experience shows that it operates more like a scam, capitalizing on unsuspecting customers and offering little in return.",1,19/12/2022
"Look, it's highly variable. Sometimes you'll get sometimes and be pleasantly surprised by how reasonable it actually is, other times you get trash. Pros: Some stuff is actually pretty decent, the exact same thing you'd get on Amazon for about half the priceCons: You won't get the same customer service or sense of security you will with Amazon, where you know you can send back damaged items and just get a refund. One major concern is probably the packaging. I've received broken/damaged items on a couple of occasions and it's just not as straightforward a process. If you feel like you have the energy to pursue that or cut your losses, it's probably fine, because it seems a bit of an inevitability with them. I'd say I've had about a 60 percent success rate.",2,19/12/2022

"I had a 10 days delay for two packages that finally they had them combined in one without asking me and when i opened it to my surprise there where many items missing. I looked carefully at the package and i noticed that it had been opened before and resealed carefully with tape so i took a picture and send it to TEMU asking them for a refund for those items that i didn't receive. They denied their responsibility by saying that they checked  with their warehouse and the order had left safe and corect. I was very upset and wrote to them that i do not care where someone opened the package but for the fact that i did receive less items than i paid. Yesterday i got an apology saying that they checked again the case and they can see from the picture i did send to them that the package was opened and they are sorry for combining two orders in one without asking me and they will send me a ""partial"" refund of  7,99 euros meanwhile the cost of the missing items is 43 euros. That made me so angry again and wrote to them that i will never shop from them again and i will report this matter anywhere i can!!!!! ps. Today finally after a long chat and a lot of repeating of the details they offered me a partial refund for both orders for the total amount of 27,86 euros. I did accept the refund even though i told them that i am not very happy with all this situation and with the long efford so i closed the case with a small cost!",1,20/12/2022

I have had no problems with quality of products though. Some fantastic solutions!",4,23/12/2022
I do not have a problem with Temu. My problem is withthe delivery company. I ordered from Temu and my order was not delivered. I tried several times to contact the delivery company but they did not respond. How do I contact Temu?? Their customer service every time directs me to the delivery company.,5,24/12/2022
"This is an email I sent TEMU and noone has responded all Ive received is nothing but RUDE agents.Despite your records indicating the items were packaged and shipped, the fact remains that I did not receive the items from orders PO-211-11063405481591913 and PO-211-11063444071031913. I authorized these purchases, but they arrived incomplete. This situation is unacceptable and contrary to the service quality I expect from Temu.I demand a prompt resolution to this issue in the form of a refund or Temu credit. As a loyal customer, I should not be penalized for errors that occurred on your end. I expect Temu to uphold its commitment to exceptional service by addressing this matter fairly and swiftly.Thank you for your immediate attention to this issue. I look forward to your prompt resolution.",1,24/12/2022
"NO Service! Should you have a question or a problem, there is NO ONE to help! It is a completely automated system. We tried & tried to get someone to respond with no luck. Temu responded but nothing changed! They offered ""live chat"" which doesn't exist on their site, it is all BOT, no real people. STILL NO CUSTOMER SERVICE @ Temu.",1,24/12/2022
Temu is selling people mostly junk or flawed items it's out of control and trading standards should be stepping in and stopping temu from shipping junk made in a shed by god knows what kind of labour they use... they are annoying with promises and rip you off ... go temu... wish 2.0,1,24/12/2022
"Be very cautious with this company.They take your money for items that look nothing like their pictures. The goods are over-packed and squashed into the packaging until they're bursting out, often arriving damaged. If anything is missing, they refuse to provide a refund.The products are made of cheap plastic, and what appears to be lovely 3D ornaments in their photos they arrive as  flat plastic ornamnets.  The jewellery is particularly concerning, made with harmful metals that exceed safety standards. The garden flowers all fall apart and loose their colours after a few days  and the clothes are suited for very tiny people as they are extremely small and they have a weird smell when they arrive. I have watched the ch.4 documentary about this company called  ""the truth about Temu dispatches""  and definitely will be deleting my  account after watching this programe. Absolutely worrying and concerning. Absolutely shocking experience.Your policy is irrelevant as you dont adhere to it. This company is a joke.Despite my continuous and non stop communication with customer service, you have consistently refused non stop to provide a replacement or refund for the missing item, valued at ??2.39. You insist it was included in the parcel, when it was not.I stand by my review based on the points mentioned above. This company is awful. I will be terminating my account.",1,24/12/2022
"UPDATE: THEY RESPOND BELOW GIVING THE IMPRESSION THEY ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BUT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING!!!I placed an order for several items with Temu on 8th July.I received a confirmation email, which recommended double checking address.I realised I had not updated to my new address, so selected the 'update address' button and changed my address.I received an email confirming my address had been updated.A few days later decided to track my order, which had been split into 2.One order had been updated with the address, the other had not. So one of our orders went to our old address several hundred kilometres away.Repeated emails and chats with Temu, returns the same suggestion over and over, that I need to resolve this myself. Theybwill not accept responsibility for what is, in effect, a bug in their system. I now need to work out how to get my items delivered to me. They are refusing to reimburse for any charges I may incur.",1,24/12/2022

I ordered goods but TEMU didn't have them and told me I could have credit to order something instead . I didn't want anything else but they won't put my money back into my account.  I will contact the UK Police as this is theft.,1,25/12/2022
"TEMU are disgusting! Not only have they cancelled their Farmland free gift challenge game in Spain when I am on the verge of winning free gifts, but they also refunded for goods not delivered, then gave me ???5 compensation plus ???1.94 credit from a while back which I went to combine against a fit watch that was ???15 meaning I had to add ???8.06 which I went to do, only to find their minimum spend had suddenly gone from ???10.00 up to ???20.00 & keeps increasing!When I try to buy a watch closer to the ???20 mark, the shopping basket doesn't add my credit at all, which I can only imagine is due to said item already having a ""large discount"" on it and they don't  want me applying the credit, so that means the credit isn't even real!!!

They use clickbait 'win 10 free prizes' send a bunch of people you know a link to visit and confirm then string you along while never reaching 0.0 thus never getting your items all in 23 hours. Their items aren't especially well made just cheap.,1,26/12/2022

"I started with Temu around April got some good buys all shirts fit to big so sent them back and ordered all small perfect fit, free shipping and returns free shipping. I got a nice pair of loafers $16.00. fit so nice.If you return something you get a credit not money back to you. This is the way they operate you come back to spend your credit.They sent me 6 gulf shirts without my authorization and above all they automatically took money from my pay pal account. Their web site is hard to navigate is just not easy to get a return shipping label. I found their support phone number and called the girl was broken English hard for me to understand her any ways I asked her for her manager so what they did was told me to keep the golf shirts and they returned me my money plus extra over and above what they originally took. But they give me a credit to spend for more merchandise. They were very accommodating. So I gave them 4 star rating.",4,27/12/2022
don't order I have just found out from my bank they have been taking money out of my account they are scammed 17.90 out of my account and I want it all back I am going to the Police if not it is you who has been taken the payment not anywhere else and it is not the first time you have done it so don't try and get out of it,1,27/12/2022

It was your courier who  had lost the package! and you want me to wait for another 10 day just to be considered a refund?! if your courier never admitted the mistake, you want your customer to Never get the refund?! that is ridiculous! I'm not sure if Temu wants any business in North America! Thank God i only ordered $17.63 worth of stuff, imagine i had ordered $170... Anyway, I don't think i would be using Temu again!",1,27/12/2022
Great products,5,27/12/2022
Do not be scammed by the 90 credit offer.You will be lead to believe you only have to spend a small amount of money to receive this but it's absolutely rubbish. I tried to complain and was thanked for my review. So I have blocked them and will never shop there again. As a pensioner I am not good with computers and can ill afford to spend money. Be warned,1,27/12/2022
"The scale and efficiency of the operation is staggering, it seems they are building new items based on my clicks and sending them out to order  - the prices are ridiculously low - the explore section will also reccomend items to you that you didn?€?t even know you need, quite magic. They take a while to arrive and are literally impossible to hold on too! I have bought 25 - 30 items over 2 orders and honestly have not got a single thing still in my possession - weird! Maybe a spiriitual clawback from incumbents. The marketing process is completely demented and infuriating constantly saying they are ?€?awfully sorry for the delay?€? when there is no context or reason, beyond getting you to spin a wheel and buy some more items that will blow away like dust in the wind.EDIT: Wow. On a separate note, ordering a hit on customers who provide constructive feedback is NOT acceptable, eek you just lost a star for that you scamps. Now, on your WeiEDIT2. Also, look this company is a weapon of mass market destruction a complete and brutal war machine on the west; by providing us, TOO GOOD a deal. But hey, then we make us lose the items, will we learn eventually? No. I just bought literally 700 pound worth of s*** for 20. It?€?s like hand sanitizer, if it?€?s there I?€?ll use it even though it kills us all, so try get rid of it. Where am I gonna get my grills from?! Muahah",2,27/12/2022

"A family member warned me not to use Temu, I should have listened. He told me that at first everything is going to go smoothly and then Temu would start failing. He was absolutely right.I have requested at least 6 refunds for orders that never arrived. The Customer Service agents barely speak English, they lie to you as well, example I asked them not to use USPS with my packages because after losing 6 of them I was done with that. The agent promised me that they were going to block USPS. Well, all three packages were sent via USPS because ""it was cheaper"" - alright, I had my screenshots and asked for a supervisor...the agent went into a circle repeating that ""I'm here to help"" and never acknowledged my request for a supervisor. I'm actually still waiting to hear back from someone, and that's a week waiting to hear from someone that actually might care about customers.I opened a claim with PayPal in hopes of getting my money back. I won't ever recommend Temu to anyone, save yourself the trouble and buy from Amazon even if it is more expensive. Edit: Temu had the audacity to reply to my complaint with a canned answer that has nothing to do with my issue. That's the clear example of how bad their customer service is.BTW, I'm still waiting for a supervisor to contact me, zero communication from Temu.",1,27/12/2022
Ordered 3 x iron skillet pans and some other kitchen items and I was happy with the quality. Yes some items were not so great but overall I was happy with our order. I would recommend but just read the advert in full to understand what you are getting. We will use again.,5,27/12/2022

"I have ordered probably 12-15 items from Temu in the past. I have maybe 6 or 7 of those items that I like and feel are of good quality. However, the remainder have fabric that is so thin it is transparent. You not only see your underwear but the entire outline of your body. The fit is sometimes a bit odd, a bit on the large side. The one thing that really stands out however, is the return process. It is super simple and they always give a 100% refund very quickly. It really does set them apart and helps make up for the hit or miss quality.",4,28/12/2022

"Normally I don't leave reviews but I decided to order from Temu and only AFTER the order I read the reviews here and was shocked and concerned about this website and was even ready to lose 20 euros (1 polo and 2 sport sleeveless) but everything went smoothly, I got my package within one week and quality seems to be ok. Well, the polo isn't made from cotton but for such a price it's fine. So, I think Temu deserves a good review",5,28/12/2022
"The pictures of products bear little resemblance to the actual products,except the stickers which are good quality. The other stuff if its seems cheap pricewise its becsuse its is ..cheap quality and much smaller so check the size carefully if you want to risk your money.

"I am a frequent customer.  Never disappointed.  If something does go amiss ( once or twice) Temu is is lightening fast to refund or send missing product etc.  Just this week I received a 20 x 10 chicken run/cage.  Good quality, all the pieces accounted for!",5,28/12/2022
"So many deals, sales and discounts. But they changed the price on what I wanted to cater for the discount to turn out to be more expensive than previously. Then once I purchased the price went back to the original. I ended up paying more with their bs discounts",1,28/12/2022
"The first order in Temu and was ???15.30, which I accepted to pay via PayPal. I made sure there were no other checkboxes selected to avoid any extra charges. A few minutes later, I logged into my PayPal account because I don't trust this companys. I saw an automatic payment, and they had already charged me an additional ???120. This is not right, so I give them 1 star for this. Edited: 3 stars now because they quickly handled my request and I got my money back.",3,28/12/2022
"Hello! I am writing with a request to return everything as it was before: added a bank card, added items to the cart, paid without problems, picked up the order without problems. no, it was necessary to add a useless thing like CVV code, which by the way is CONFIDENTIAL information of the buyer. we are people too, and this kind of thing doesn?€?t inspire confidence in us, you never know, there are hackers on the site, everyone is waiting for me to give the red carpet to hack my bank card. please return it back, payment for the order is no problem, because people who are very vigilant about such little things will refuse to order on your website,likewise, customers will fall.

"I've shopped with Temu for a while and have always been very satisfied with their products and service. Until now.On 6 July 2024 I ordered one set of 3 hand weights (3,5 and 8 lbs) and the stand for the listed price of $6.99. I refuse to install the app, only order online and have receipts with pictures.On 10 July 2024 I received an email my order had been delivered but I couldn't find it. After much back and forth with the post office and Temu, I learned it had been delivered to the wrong address. USPS informed me that not only does the tracking number not match my address, but the product weight was listed at 3 oz. For 6 hand weights and the stand.Temu denies the address is incorrect and will only confirm my address of record as the one the weights were delivered to.USPS and the tracking email I received says otherwise, the zip code on the email does not match mine.I attempted to find a similar set but there is nothing on the entire site for under $30+. I believe my order was a pricing error...or a scam...and I will not receive this item for the listed price. Temu customer service has been disappointing in its response. I'm reserving judgement whether I do business with Temu but will definitely never again do business with their vendor HEALT HONG.Very disappointing.UPDATE 11 July 2024: In the spirit of transparency and fairness I?€?m updating my experience; Temu has issued a full refund.",2,28/12/2022

I kept getting the same message about my order status and nothing about my actual issue of not getting my order confirmation in my email. My email was confirmed on their site before this too.

"Be very careful with Temu. I ordered 6 retractable freestanding garden fences which are impossible to assemble due to a fundamental fault in design. The company is uninterested and will only offer a refund on return even though they are unusable. They are clearly seconds but sold as perfect with a price to match!Returning such large items is a chore especially as my local Correos office is 20km away but I have no choice.I will stick with Amazon from now on, Temu are a waste of time.Please note that the reply from Temu is a template I have already received twice from their customer service department when I asked for help with the situation. It is completely insincere, just a bunch of meaningless platitudes.No solution was offered except return which is extremely difficult from a tiny mountain village.The fences I received are a completely different model from those advertised and missing the vital diagonal supports which give stability to the base. They are a very cheap model by comparison retailing at far less and without the weight or strength I had expected.I am more annoyed than I was before having seen Temu's response to my issue. Clearly they didn't bother to check anything or they would have been aware of my extended communication with their customer service department yesterday.I cannot find words to express my contempt for this unscrupulous company.",1,30/12/2022

"Their customer service is superb.The product quality is consistently outstanding, exceeding my expectations. I was completely impressed with their professionalism and customer service.. ??????",5,02/01/2023
"I am so very, very disappointed in Temu.  Twice I wasted my time ordering from Temu and got notification of delivery which did not happen. Most recently this morning July 9, 2022. This last one was extremely disheartening  as I ordered items I needed for my trip to Prague at the end of the month. VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED, TEMU!!! I hate to think they are dishonest as I have received two other ordered as scheduled.  But!!!!",5,03/01/2023
Do not use this company. They saved my card details although I didn't authorise them to. They have sent two unrequested packages and charged me for them then I have the lengthy task of returning and getting a refund.Despite asking to be unsubscribed I continue to receive unrequested marketing eMails. The online chat is useless with operators avoiding answering the questions put to them.I believe their actions are bordering on fraudulent and they are almost impossible to get rid of.avoid at all cost,1,03/01/2023
"it worked last time I ordered. this time I accepted some deal on shoes etc, but at no point could I enter the size of shoes I want.. and of course the ""support"" button is just endless loading, when i try to enter the order I get endless loading .. seems the only thing that works in the app is making orders. so I'm guessing I'll receive tiny shoes and never use Temu again :)",3,03/01/2023
"They used to be good - if there were issues with the delivery, you could get a refund. But not anymore. I ordered a pack of 3 macrame plant hangers but only received 1. All attempts to contact their support failed - I only receive bot answers and the refund requests are automatically declined. I guess this is just the way all Chinese retailers go: first they attract customers with nice prices and customer-friendly approach, but after a while you are left with no ordered items and no money. Such a shame! Stay away from these guys, they are just dishonest.",1,03/01/2023
"I recently ordered from Temu and was very disappointed with the service. Two items were missing from my package, and when I contacted customer support, they refused to offer a refund. They asked if I had a video of the unboxing, which is an unreasonable expectation as most people don?€?t record themselves opening packages. This made me feel like they were questioning my honesty. I would not recommend shopping with Temu due to their poor customer service and lack of accountability.So I paid for items and never received them.",1,03/01/2023
I absolutely love Temu. The majority of items I have purchased are of great quality. I find their Customer Service agents excellent and have never had any issues getting a problem resolved and I'm shopping with them for over a year.,5,03/01/2023
"TEMU advertise that they will credit you ??4 for late deliveries - this is false - i have contacted them twice, and no credit has been applied after delivery due date.",1,04/01/2023
"They lur you with a free gift to become a customer, but it turns out there are nu such things as free gifts, suddenly it becomes a discount and you end up paying, asside this they use a very agressive way of advertisement you are constantly pushed to buy with claims of discount, last items on stock, buy more pay less, etc. I just removed the app and will go on with my live.",1,04/01/2023
Since My review below I am still waiting to be contacted - I have used the link provided and is same poor customer service ???? rubbish service never use or recommend them again no response within 2 days no support whatsoever. Very disappointed and upset set with whole experience Customer service is absolutely rubbish - I received two items which had damaged and parts missing - I am Disabled and vulnerable and have tried to get replaced or a credit note added to the account - however they have treated me like a Liar - I have disposed of the items as they were useless and I was unable to return - I do not have a working camera on my phone so unable to send photos - have now replaced through Amazon and the service by Amazon was much better - I am waiting rest of my orders to be delivered and I will never use Temu again - am still waiting for a outcome of the complaint I have lodged - very disappointed customer,1,04/01/2023
Temu is a good online store but there are still very expensive things.,4,05/01/2023
"I was ready to buy another load of items, but I left my shopping cart because, full with items because it supposed be a minimum of $25+tax for free shipping and all of it sudden they raised it up to a minimum $35+tax to bad cause I've been buying constantly being a loyal costumer, I won't be buying from them any more, goodbye.",1,05/01/2023
"I've been ordering through Temu for the last 2 months (5 orders).  All orders arrived withing 2 weeks and was always updated on the shipping.  All clothing products were better quality than expected.  I had to return 2 items, due to my mistake on sizing.  Received return print label through email, repacked items and brought to local transport company that is authorized.  I had requested a credit to my Temu account and money was credited the same day. Totally satisfied with all products reveived",5,05/01/2023
"Low quality clothing, although the price is very good you can tell it is low cost, for a hurry saves you but it is a single use clothing. :(",3,05/01/2023
Been using temu to buy a few things over the last few months very happy with the merchandise that I have received. But only fault is that I have bought some joggers and shorts for summer. But when washed there on a low heat there seem to come out with holes thought it was just the washer but ordered another pair same problem when washed so be wary of buying  polyester. But apart  from that everything is just as described,5,05/01/2023
Only a new customer bought package of pens but only a single one came bad quality not like pictures. Bought a pair of sunglasses very bad quality would not even stay on my face without holding them I live in Ireland will not shop again might be cheep but not worth it if only fit for bin.,1,05/01/2023
"This company contacted me to be a reviewer of products. They do not send reviewers the actual product, though, I was instructed to give 5 stars without actually ever seeing or handling the item. I asked, ""to be clear, these are fake reviews for items I have not used"" they answered: ""yes. you understand the job correct"". Total SCAM.

"I had on order placed on items l had in my cart, l put these items in the cart while l decided if l wanted any of them.There were duplicate items such as two different styles of bath mats, two different styles of shower curtains etc.Temu took these items and created an order costing $193.24.They took my money through PayPal I contacted them right away expecting them to say , we'll start the refund for me, they would send me a return label and as soon as the items are received by Temu the refund would be issued That never happened.There are many emails from me asking when will l get my refund .These email responses were from many different reps.Since l got no reply saying I will get my money back l thought it was time to file a claim about this. I've tried several times to complete the questionnaire and before l could finish l was timedOut I am going to try to find a phone number.Temu is the worst company l have ever found to be this dishonest and l have to shop on line as l have chronic renal failure and a condition that makes my blood pressure bottom out and causes me to faint.I am 69 and I live alone so their is zero chance anyone else would make rhis purchase.This ordeal has caused anxiety, sleepless nights..Why would they take this much money from me?",1,06/01/2023
"Pop up Temu advert was for 'Jobs Vacancies' . I clicked on it as I suspected it was a scam and sure enough, not a single job vacancy, just more cheap tat that they are desperate to sell.I have reported Temu formally to Advertising Standards for their persistent scam adverts for jobs, financial services and all sorts of other things they don't sell, yet they still get people like Microsoft to take their advertising money.",1,06/01/2023
"I am still waiting for goods to be delivered, I?€?ve paid for it, I feel cheated, please get back to me, the amount was taken from my account",1,07/01/2023
"The company is amateurish and deceitful, the special offers don't materialise, customer service are evasive and they don't appear to actually have any of the items in stock. They blarneyed on about meaningless reference numbers which only meant that they didn't do or have what they offered. Don't get involved with this company it's not worth the trouble!",1,07/01/2023

"My first and last order . i ordered a shower curtain which let water from the shower splash straight through. 2nd item was a bathroom shelf...which was so bent it would not sit straight.

"Temu offers promotions that are false advertising, the app lies and the customer service will copy and paste lazy answers to questions you never asked to avoid responsibility. Don't play any of their promoted games, don't fall for the lies from the app about credits and always check photo reviews before buying. Also had my positive review about a dog swimming life jacket removed as apparently my dog was offensive.. stopped reviewing after that. This app is only good for cheap small things.",1,08/01/2023

"so i've been purchasing from them for about a year and a half , have had some issues in the past was a little hassle but was resolved for the most part without to much sweat and tears , not even close to as good customer service as some other shopping sites we know and love but up till this point i guess you get what you pay for that was until yesterday when my package arrives im really confused by the size of the bag because i know the amount of items im expecting and there's just no way they are in there so hoping i'm wrong i open up the bag and i'm pulling out small items like a pillow cover ,scissors , cleaning brush ect but after pulling out a few items along with a birthday card i never purchased but was complimentary i guess since my birthday is in a few days , which givin what in fact is about to happen dealing with them is either a dig at me from the person packing my stuff or just really ironic , because after just a few items im done there's nothing left in this bag and i'm really confused because there was no shipment being split into multiple shipments ect , there was 10 items missing from this small-ish bag 2  13 inch antiques style mirrors 5  6 piece sets of food storage containers 2 additional pairs if kitchen scissors and a cleaning brush  , i reach out let them know by phone and they say i need to speak to a specialist but that person left for the day the specialist will call me tomorrow but in the meantime i can go online and request a refund , so i do and it says i have to up load photos of all the items a received along with the packaging , so i lay out everything along with the temu bag that clearly shows the bag with my name and the tracking number ect and you can clearly see in the photo that there was no way that bag was fitting all the items that are missing , that bag was already crammed when it got to me , there was no way it was fitting two 13 inch mirrors ( whether they come disassembled or not ) let alone 5 sets of containers and each set includes 3 containers 3 lids  not to mention the other small items its absolutely impossible , anyway i take the pictures upload it all tick all the boxes it it said that the estimated amount of the refund would be about 12 bucks and change and i have to wait for someone to review this claim um ok sure, i wake up this morning to a email saying ,Kate Marjorie PabalanJul 7, 2024, 8:49 amDear Valued Customer,Greetings from the Temu Customer Service Team.

"Ordered, on June 28th, 2 pieces ZEALOT S67 60W Wireless Speakers for a birthday gift on July 11th.I picked the version ""from local warehouse shipment within 4 - 8 days"" and paid more than for the "" from Zealot direct"" ( = from China ) version. Today, July 7th, not shipped yet and all solicits were answered with long lipservice BS - but no shipment date !Payments was done, of course. ""Local warehouse "" at a higher cost when shipped anyway from China ??? I consider that DISHONEST !Never ever TEMU, never ever Zealot !!!",1,11/01/2023

"People like to buy Chinese stuff from all companies in US and pay alot to low quality products, temu have good (not the best not bad too) products with great prices,  same stuff you have pay double or more to get it in US they give it to you with a great price,  I'm not sure why people still complain?Me, personally I appreciate temu because so many of things I been wanting to have make them mine. I'm happy and happy to spend every penny I been spending with them. Keep good job guys #Temu",5,11/01/2023

I WAS A RELUCTANT CUSTOMER BUT ENCOURAGED BY A FRIEND. IF ONLY I HAD LISTENED TO MY GUT. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. DREADFUL EXPERIENCE IN EVERY DAMN WAY,1,12/01/2023
"Could be very good but misleading and deceptive marketing free credits are just plain shonky and I did try and read the T & C's but made no sense. Temu response was to contact them how about stop misleading promotions as pointed out in several other reviews.Also disappointed in Trustpilot handling of reply from Temu, just read other reviews with same problem also cannot reply to Trustpilot email!",1,12/01/2023
Was very wary at first but have since placed many orders. Most of the items are of good quality though occasionally items are smaller than expected or not quite like the picture. They keep you up to date with shipping. I would say their roulette games and daily spins are to be avoided as they are there to encourage you to buy but they do offer you one free return on multiple orders and you get to keep the item. It is addictive though so be cautious!,5,12/01/2023
They keep on saying that my parcel is in the time frame when it's not even on a flight yet while a parcel ordered later has been on a flight and cleared customs,1,12/01/2023
"Order with care and check prices elsewhere before buying.Temu started off OK with reasonable prices and not too bad delivery times however as Temu has become more widely known the service and prices have changed and not for the better.Some items are cheap or very slightly cheaper but most are no cheaper than buying from UK. I have compared prices on Amazon many times only to find Amazon was cheaper! Prices are hiked up to ridiculous amounts so they can give you ?€?discounts ?€?. These are not discounts they are the correct price! Items are shipped by land without prior warning. You don?€?t know this in advance of ordering which items will be shipped by land and which by air but if items are shipped by land you can expect to wait over a month for delivery! Today 7th July I am still waiting on an order placed 16 June and there has been no update on tracking for nearly a week! Aggressive and annoying marketing constant emails and notifications offering ?€?discounts?€? that aren?€?t true discounts, endless pop ups and the ridiculous spinning wheel offering you a discount you cannot claim! Overall I don?€?t see why I would continue to order items apart from the odd item that is genuinely at a good price but most things I can get on eBay or Amazon at the same or very close to same price if not cheaper and I don?€?t have to wait weeks for delivery!",3,12/01/2023
Quality of merchandise could be a little bit better. Description didn?€?t really match the pictures.. size chart is very different than most sites. None of my items that I ordered fit the size that I usually wear.. customer service was very nice and easy to work with,2,12/01/2023
Did not  get the package I paid for want to know where. It is I already paid for it,1,12/01/2023
"I was very happy with TEMU website and I fully  switched all my shopping from Amazon to Temu. Free delivery, free returns and items are almost the same. Today unexpectedly  they set up a limit for minimum order on my account. It says on the website that they offer free shipping on ALL orders, but when I contacted their customer service they said this was only for items that sold by Temu. All my items are sold by TEMU, so there should be no reason for setting the limit. It does not say anything about exceptions and not even mention about 35$ minimum to spend. The info on the website is misleading. No trust to TEMU anymore. Tomorrow they would tell no more free returns for you. By the way, all my friends still enjoy free shipping on any order, but because they set a limit only for me, maybe it's time to switch back to Amazon. Very disappointed.",1,13/01/2023
I can?€?t understand why it is taking so long to receive items!!!! I?€?m so annoyed it?€?s been far to long and when I look at the app it states order will take even longer than advertised in total it will be 3 weeks plus if that goes to plan . I?€?m being bombarded with discounts to buy more without having my first order ! Too slow & too high pressured marketing,1,13/01/2023
It's easy to be mislead when looking at the items on their site. But very rarely does the actual item and website photo match. Their things are cheaply made and don't last long I purchased a pair of colorful overalls. There were three buttons on each strap so you could adjust for the best fit. It all seems just fine until you realize the buttons are glued on!  They started falling off an hour after I put it on,2,13/01/2023
"When I first started ordering from Temu over a year ago I was pretty pleased; low prices and decent quality on most items.  Now their prices are going up and quality is going down.  Lately I have received a lot of items that were broken or broke the first time used, items do not meet the ad description, they don't work at all and are very cheaply made.  Also. you have to pay close attention when ordering.  If you add something to your cart and go back later to place the order the price will be raised.  Most of their kitchen items are junk and their artificial flowers are terrible.  Be very careful what you order.",2,13/01/2023
Said I won a free prize and have to download app to get it. I did and said I don?€?t qualify not a first time buyer. I just made a purchase for first time. There were other things they said I won like 100% money back. Etc.,3,14/01/2023
DO NOT USE TEMU!!!!  ordered 3 things money came out my bank what a fxxck on they used a made up email address that I have no access to they are saying I need to access it to confirm order like I said useless scammed me out of 15 quid.,1,14/01/2023
Temu is no different than every other asian wharehouse with useles stuf. When. Every time my sister orderd something it was borken within 2 weeks. And you don't have to dig deep to find that temu has been acused of child labor and slavery many times. Horrible,1,14/01/2023
Most of the products I have got have been true to size just the odd one or 2 items which are small size but overall you get what what you pay for and there is a few bargains to grab I got to say though be careful it can be quite addictive,5,14/01/2023

"I ordered last Sunday, since ordering I have been bombarded with emails with special offers and free gifts and discounts and the same goes on WhatsApp, its overwhelming and irritating beyond belief, all I wanted was a few items of clothing",1,15/01/2023
"Furious... Clearpay (credit) suddenly appeared when I tried to pay for goods of ??22 (over the ??15 shipping) Credit via clearpay had been added to my account payment system so partial payment never qualified for the ??15 max shipping.I've never used Clearpay, looking it up i discovered it was credit... So Temu is sneakingly forcing me to add/purchase more goods to qualify for shipping and create a debt situation without any authorisation.When I complained they kept insisting I added clearpay. I ONLY USE PAYPAL there is no Clearpay linked to my Paypal.I insisted it was done by Temu to increase sales and create debt or my account was hacked.They said no hack and are ignoring the issue to remove clearpay.SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!!!Look up TEMU NEGATIVES on Google... AVOID!!!!Ironic... Several days later and after threatening to leave Temu, Temu removed Clearpay from my account, thereby proving they HAD added it to force more sales and create debt!!!!",1,15/01/2023
"I have placed numerous orders with Temu and, until recently, have been very satisfied with their service. However, their decision to switch to a new logistics partner has led to a noticeable decline in delivery quality. My latest order is now being sent to a distant parcel locker instead of my home address, with no option to change the delivery location. Additionally, their customer service has been unhelpful and unable to grasp the problem.",1,15/01/2023

"The problem is your strategy for giving free gifts. My free items got down to 50 cents and it told me on the website that this was the last person I would have to invite before receiving the free gifts. However, it never gave me my gifts and this is false advertising because all of the time I spent doing the invitations and then do not get any free gifts. When I called customer service I was told that the orders that I had for free gifts had already expired so I was supposed to start all over again which was not going to happen because you never do get it down to get a free gift!! The spinning wheel is ridiculous!",1,15/01/2023

They would get -100 as a rating if Thai were an option.",1,17/01/2023
I quite like temu. I don?€?t order often but when I have everything has been quite good. I wouldn?€?t order clothes from them again as they break very easily (5 tops down) but their household products are still going strong for me months later so you win some you lose some.

"The products I've purchased from temu, range from JUST about worth the cost (in other words, you could spend ??20 on a pair of boots, but find better ones for ??13 at Shoezone in UK) to shockingly terrible quality. I bought a disc drive. Lasted maybe 10 uses. A pair of cargo trousers. They felt cheap but ok. Zip lasted about 5 uses. Bike pump didn't work AT ALL. Their stuff all looks good on the site, but less so in real life. And usually it's worse than it looks. Spend a bit more and get it from a shop or Ebay. Easier to return if you don't think it's worth the price.",2,19/01/2023
Never ever received items ordered kept getting excuse and then asked if I'd like to make another order but still taking money for orders that have never arrived I would advise anyone not to botherx,1,19/01/2023
"End of the day they just take your money, if dont get parcel its ur problem they care only with mssages nicely 'sorry blah blah' but no reship and no refund They just repeat "" imile delivered to you"" until you just give up by being pissed off. I felt whats different to scam. They scam ur money in polite way. Its disgusting. How sad i paid for nothing. Now i see, so many people had same experience, Temu and imile might work together as scam team, who knows. They offer you low price and scam ur money random. Thats how they make money.",1,19/01/2023
"I wrote a review about temu customer service and product i recieved that was damaged. They emailed me to say they were not publishing review. I recieved an order with damaged shoes and items that were 2 big, i went through Temu returns process and was only given the Evri return option. The value of goods to be returned was ??70.00, temu offered me 20% of next order upto ??20.00. I refused as the value of goods to be returned was ??70.00. Shoes could not be repaired/ worn and other items too big, so why would anyone accept that?. I offered to return items via royal mail if they could send me a pre paid lable. This was ignored and i was advised to return via Evri. I took a photo of Evri saying there was no return facility near me and explained to temu my nearest evri facility is a 180 mile round trip from me.Again i was refused refund and offered 20% discount on next order upto a maximum of ??20.00. I submitted review on Temu about the boots and evri with photos showing damage and evri location facility and was still refused refund. Temu then refused to publish my review.......i had placed lots of orders with Temu upto this point and spent a fortune. I have cancelled some orders that had not yet been shipped and will never shop with Temu again.!!!!!! Temu response to this absolute rubbish as i could not return items as explained earlier, and i did contact with photos of damaged items, so, be aware!!!!!",1,21/01/2023
"It has been sometime since I used Temu simply because they were a nightmare to use and I spent inordinate amounts of time resolving issues. In the main because they have very poor customer service who will not put you through to a manager even if you continually ask. But they were just starting out so I thought I would give them another chance. So what has changed, late deliveries you only get ??4 instead of ??5, and now you need to spend ??15 instead of ??10 and the trust pilot score is dropping. Apart from that everything is as it was appalling as it was. I wonder if their TP score hits 1 the penny will drop that they need to do better. You will note the same we will just bull you and won't bother to answer your comments. As I have said nothing has changed same appalling service!",1,21/01/2023
"The most terrible company, in every way. Products of execrable quality, extraordinarily bad shipping, but the worst experience is that of the return. After walking from one side to another to drop off the package (the instructions on the website have nothing to do with reality), you wait a month to receive a refund that was not even issued. I have been to the bank several times so far, only to be told that the ARN code sent by them to verify my transaction is invalid. There is no other solution/proof that the money left them. But the bank claims that no refund request was issued from them...So, keep in mind that you will never receive the money for the products you send as a return, from this terribly bad Chinese company!!!",1,21/01/2023

"I supposedly recently received two orders from Temu. I only received one and requested a refund for the missing order from Temu.They asked me to look all over for the missing order, but it still was not found. I told them the shipping service they used loses orders all the time (they have the lowest online rating possible). I showed them how both orders had the same photo of one Temu order in the same position. Just when I thought things were resolved, they suggested I look inside the package for both orders together.This would be 11 items, and they wouldn't all fit. They said this three times.I even reached out to Temu and PDD leadership about this out of frustration. My family is a good customer of theirs, and we have recommended Temu to countless others, both online and offline.  All they have to do is look at my communications back and forth to them via email and with their customer service and they will see all the details.  I was told several times by Temu they would resolve my situation via their escalation team within 24 hours and they do not.  I keep getting what looks like an AI response which doesn't resolve my situation.  I just got Thank you for reaching out to the Temu Customer Service Team. We're pleased to be able to connect with you. It's always a pleasure to serve you, and we're grateful for the opportunity to meet your needs.We understand your concern and apologize for any inconvenience caused. After conducting a thorough investigation, we have confirmed that the package was delivered to the correct address. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a reshipment or refund for your order. We kindly suggest that you check your mailbox, around your house, and any other possible locations where the package may have been delivered. Sometimes packages can be left in unexpected places.",1,23/01/2023
"Thank you for your response. Should I use the things that I wanted to return or wait for your action. Because I am going from here on 7th of July. Kindly update me.I bought things worth 890dhs from Temu and I wanted to return things but I am not able to do it as it's showing my payment is not updated. I made payment on Monday and Thursday also I am waiting for their updation. When I spoke to the staffs they are saying they cannot do anything. How long I have to wait for the updation, I don't know. I will never use Temu and I will not suggest it to anyone.",1,23/01/2023
I would recommend to everyone to purchase. It?€?s not only fast and good prices. Through models of cloths and shoes etc you could be trendy every day.

"I previously wrote a review that I have now removed because I was worried that the minimum checkout price would keep increasing but it did not and I am happy about that. In fact, I am happy with some other things too. Temu does have a wide choice and there is something for everyone on the app. Items range from pennies to pound range, from bargain basics to premium show off and everything in-between. Items on TEMU are competitively priced and often further discounts are offered via voucher codes or claim credit back offers, so customers are almost guaranteed a good deal.Temu are very good when things go wrong and in my experience they work hard to make things right.Obviously TEMU cannot stop damage during transit and items do go missing. With huge numbers of items sold it is unfortunate but things sometimes get to the customer damaged in some way, TEMU has a refund or replace policy and the customer service agents are usually available, fast acting and friendly. Even the bot has refunded me when it reviewed the photo of a damaged item, I thought that was very cool but it was also fast and efficient and I was a happy customer.I know some people are worried about security but nearly all companies or websites collect data on customers it's not anything new.I hope to keep shopping for great items...Thanks TEMU!",5,23/01/2023

I needed the items for preparing my products which have been indefinitely delayed. The courier company is unreachable, in fact Temu is not able to get hold of them.Now they have messaged me that the package is delivered when it clearly is not. They have shown that the delivery was done at 1:47am in the night at a safe place. When I am asking for a refund they ask me to contact customer service without providing any link or contact information. They are frauds.",1,23/01/2023
"for 2 years i loved temu. Then in february this year (2024) I bought an item and paid for it with my paypal account. A few days later I realised I had forgotten to buy something so bought it and again paid via paypal. That is 2 seperate purchases on 2 seperate days each paid for seperately. A few days later I started getting an alert from my bank saying there was a payment due to come out. I was told by my bank to get in touch with paypal as this is where the issue was. Paypal put a hold on my account. A few hours later I realised that what Temu had done (somehow I dont know how) was add up the 2 seperate sales and taken it as 1 singular payment, even though I had paid for each one as I bought it. I contacted Paypal and they lifted the restriction. That is when the problem with Temu started. I tried to purchase a few things but when it got to the checkout they would neither accept my debit card or my paypal saying there was a temperary hold on my account due to an ""issue"" and that it should be sorted out within a few days. That was in February. Since then when ever I have tried to buy something I get the same message. I have been in touch with Temu about 15 times asking why I cannot pay for the items I want to buy. Each time they say that the computer is showing an anomaly. I have constantly asked what the anomaly is but all they say is that it is the computer that is showing this up. I asked if they had such a thing as a person who worked on computers when there is a problem. There isnt. My bank is healthy and so is my Paypal account. They will not, however many times I have asked, explain just exactly what the anomily is. I have also a million times asked why they cant sort it out as it was their error in the first place. If they hadnt combined to payments as one even though initially I had paid for them seperatly then there would be no problem. Then they had the cheek to send a message for a ""how did we help"" feedback survey. How did they actually manage to take a single payment when I had already paid for the items a few days apart from each other. In my eyes, I seem to be banned for ever. I even tried a different debit card account but again I got nowhere. What awful customer service. You would think they would want my money and sort it out ASAP as any other company would but apparently not. If I could go for no stars I would but there isnt the option so had to begrudgingly give the company 1 star which they do not deserve.  Atwickwitch",1,24/01/2023

"Temu is master of deceptive advertising. They seem to have no understanding of Canadian law under the Competition Act.Items are routinely displayed at a certain price but when added to your shopping car, the price has magically increased. If you don't watch the process like a hawk it's very easy to miss.They routinely use terms like Gift and Gift Card that have no similarity to these terms as they are commonly used in Canada. They basically represent an ungoverned wild west of internet commerce, and are scofflaws to our laws of commerce. Zero stars - stay away! Alibaba and Aliexpress are paragons of virtue in comparison.Temu is -not- accredited by the Better Business Bureau, and currently has class action lawsuits against them in a number of US states and in Canada. As well as using ""deceptive"" and ""unscrupulous"" marketing practices (Arkansas state Attorney-General), many lawsuits concern the app""s hiding its mining of users' personal data. Others refer to the ""bait and switch"" pricing changes I've personally experienced, similar to the lawsuit that Walmart is facing. Repeated attempts to seek a resolution with Temu's ""customer service"" department only resulted in more discount coupons that are only useful if you continue to buy more of their products - but no explanation of the mysterious price hikes. Kind of like a pyramid scheme, or in economics terms, reinforcing sunk costs, sending good money after bad. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.",1,24/01/2023

"Avoid this company at all costs, but, if you do make the mistake of buying from them, be absolutely sure to use PAYPAL to pay for your items so you will be able to dispute and get your money back.  Customer care is outsourced and it shows in the way that customers are looked after, resolutions to a satisfactory level is seldom achieved and leads to more frustration to the paying customer. Products are ok and you get what you pay for, delivery is where they fail miserably with certain courier services like SAMEDAY couriers failure to deliver at all. After 3 years i am done with them. Avoid this company at all costs to save you the hassles many other people are going through, it may start of well but sooner or later the wheels will fall off. Sorry TEMU i was loyal to you, but your corporate greed and lack of integrity to your customers  will bite you in the end.ps oh and Temu if you do reply to this, please try and make it sound a bit more sincere and not one of your standard canned/scripted responses.

"NOW the 11th July and according to EVRI my order has not moved. According to TEMU it is still waiting for a  flight since the 8th July 2024. This is unacceptable and obvious that TEMU is unable to provide the service they promise. I can't wear a ??4 refund!!!  They just send stock replies while actually doing nothing and go on their own sweet way.  Combined with phishing from EVRI that could only have come via the use of TEMU, this is a disaster as far as customer service goes.  They rely on numbers so that when they lose a customer another sucker will come along. I think there's an expression that 'every minute a new sucker is born.' Sadly it appears that I am was one of them!!!! TEMU don't bother to reply. I couldn't be bothered to read it!AT THEIR REQUEST VIA TRUSTPILOT I HAVE SENT TEMU MY ORDER NUMBER WHICH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO CONFIRM THAT THIS REVIEW IS GENUINE. FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, I do not wish to provide further personal details via a system that is visible to all.  I trust TEMU will understand this and look into the issue with phishing. I have just ordered two items of clothing and to my horror I have already received a spam message where a company using the EVRI delivery company logo has made itself a member of all my WhatsApp groups and it attempting to sell me things but stating that due to missing parts of my address they cannot deliver the item. According to the delivery company the items have not even been received by them,never mind entered the UK. I have had to warn a large number of people to look out for this and delete and report. Some have already received WhatsApp requests to join via an unknown mobile numbe and I am concerned for myself and them.I have deleted the Temu app from my mobile phone, and having now read all the reviews, will be surprised and delighted if my items actually turn up within a reasonable time and if they do, turn out to be wearable. Thankfully I have only made a small order, although (and I find this odd) there is a minimum spend, and having taken a closer look at the second item, I would think it will be very skimpy and probably unsuitable.  So I'm treating it as a trial run knowing that I might have just thrown away ??16 but not expecting an immediate attempt to take over my personal data and that of others.",1,28/01/2023

Temu and it's customer service is the absolute WORST.I will chargeback with the bank. UPDATE: Everything they answer on here is FALSE.

"I have been in touch with your Temu team regarding a non receipt of an order that got marked as 'delivered' over the live chat and they were unable to proceed with a refund due to some limitations on their end. I have placed order #PO-097-21260539003511516 on 9th June and a few days ago it has been marked erroneously as delivered by the system. I have investigated into the matter and read countless of local reviews pointing out that other buyers have experienced similar after sales treatment and on a matter of principle my father's law firm would be willing to take the case to court and file for a class action lawsuit if I so choose to. I can't bare the idea that your so called dedicated team has ripped me off and declined a refund for an entire parcel that was supposedly lost or stolen in transit, and there would be dire consequences if you choose to not follow through with it. I'm writing to you here as a disgruntled customer, but if you do not handle this swiftly, I would get one of my father's employee to send you an official legal warning. Bare in mind that I'm disputing the measly sum of around 40 euros and that under Israeli law you, as the seller, are responsible for the receipt of the order rather than the other way around. Suggesting that the parcel might have been left around by the property shows complete disregard for customer satisfaction and is beyond absurd. I have emailed your legal department this warning but would like to publish it here to warn off others of the scam you're runningI look forward to hearing back from shortly.Please check out their reply. They couldn't bother doing anything more than slapping a copy and paste message in there. they obviously don't care enough to reply personally but we'll meet them in court",1,29/01/2023

"DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER MAKING SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES, REFERRING FAMILY, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, AND CO-WORKERS WHO HAVE ALSO BECOME LOYAL CUSTOMERS, MAKING SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES.

IN THE CHAT I WAS COMMUNICATING WITH JAMC A SENIOR CUSTOMER RESOLUTION SUPERVISOR WHO I BELIEVE IS THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM. SUPPOSEDLY THIS SUPERVISOR PROCESSED A REFUND TO MY METHOD OF PAYMENT.

I reopended the chat of this same order and earlier communication and was connected with the automated system when I specifically requested a live agent. This automated system said a refund had not been processed. I requested that the previous notes in the chat to be reviewed. Over and over again the automated response was that the refund had not been processed. I wrote in the chat that this was a bunch of b------t. A pop-up appeared on the screen with an option to submit my phone number and TEMU customer service will call me. thats when I spoke with Rona who requested that I not use profanity as it was not productive. I asked her how could she see the profanity in the chat and not see the notes that a refund had been processed to my method of payment by Jamc. I informed Rona of my intentions to share with the public my experience.I have a screenshot of the lengthy chat with TEMU?€?s Customer Service Senior Resolution Specialist, Jamc this morning that reflects their knowledge of this incident. I can forward the chat if required. I also spoke via telephone with a live agent named Rona in detail for quite some time today as well. TEMU is fully aware of the incident surrounding my review.

"Did like temu until money was taken out of my PayPal, when I didn't even order anything. I disputed it with PayPal. Got my money back but now temu won't let me order from there anymore. Which isn't a problem as they tried stealing from me but trying to explain the situation to them was ridiculous, no one even understood half the time and was clearly getting copied and pasted replies, rather then someone actually having a conversation with me and the fact they stopped me from ordering, when they are the ones that tried stealing from me is pretty frustrating but their loss. Not sure why they are asking me below to contact them. Clearly I've already tried that a few times and it failed",1,04/02/2023

I have had to open a paypal dispute, Temu have lied to paypal and said they refunded me as a credit to my account, so i just sent paypal a screenshot to prove this is incorrect, the refund i received was for a pair of leggings i cancelled, not the missing item.

"I have placed close to 75 orders with Temu. I have had few problems until recently. The past 6 orders have been nightmare with shipping. I have liked the company and their 1st line of Customer Service tries to be helpful and if the problem is escalated nothing happens no way to influence the shipping issues. I have NOT had problems with most products and the couple I have no issues with refunds. I placed two orders. You can not pay for expedite shipping with electronics in States so that order was the 2nd order I placed. I chose expedite shipping since I have had issues recently ( things like 6 days being handed over after clearing customs, 6 days to pack order, missed Father's  day gift though due no later than 13th showed up 20th of June)  I paid 12.90 US for it to arrive between 2nd and 8th. Reported to them on 29th still packing was being shown. ( virtual agent who escalated it.. a useless thing in my experience) and phoned today. The order is still being gathered. He explained that some items were out of stock now and they were holding the order. I requested they just cancel those items out of stock and just ship. Nope. The offer of 13.00 would be given if it doesn't arrive by 8th. Darn straight it will that is just a refund of my expedited shipping. I live in rural Maine so it won't be here even of it is shipped out today, which isn't happening.  The Customer Service people on front line offered me a 5.00 credit.. which after spending so much time on my last few orders I won't be using. I will maybe try in a few months and right now I am done with this.. hopefully they will get it back together..Update: I have changed from 1 star to 3. They were able to influence the expedite delivery and make it to my home. I thank the Customer Service agent that did the research so I could cancel the items so the order would process.",3,08/02/2023

"I used Temu for the first time to order two matching white computer desks. I got sent one white and one brown one. Tried online to get a returns label to send the brown one back. Supplied them with a photo to confirm the brown one. Was told they?€?d make a decision in 72 hours and told me I had to keep checking the messaging facility on the app or the website for their response!! I pointed out I am not downloading their app, nor am I going to keep going to their website to check for their response and asked them to email a returns label direct to me. To which they just kept saying to keep checking the message facility on the Temu app or website. The pieces of the items are absolutely filthy! Some pieces have not been spot welded properly and have come apart! Enamel is missing from parts of it. The white top of the white one is actually a dirty yellow it is so dirty!

"After emailing back and forth no less than a dozen times, TEMU refused to resolve this issue.  I ordered two of the same shoe shelves.  They were too big and cumbersome.  I asked for a return but they were way too heavy for me to lift.  TEMU offered me a ""one time keep no return"" for one item and a partial return for the other.  I even tried to arrange a pick up to return to TEMU but that is not possible without their authorization.  They ended up refunding only about $125 out of $400. About 4 times TEMU asked ME to provide screenshots of what their internal records should store.  I'm very disappointed that TEMU didn't honor their own offer to me.  I'm donating both shelves to charity.  *UPDATE* TO TEMU's REPLY BELOW:  This the same runaround response I received before this post.  Nothing has changed.",1,10/02/2023

"My experience with Temu delivery in Qatar has been extremely disappointing. On the last day of the promised delivery period, the delivery guy called me while I was out for some errands. I asked if he could deliver to my current location, but he refused and said he would deliver the next day. When I called the next day, he told me he had returned the parcel to the company. I contacted the customer service number in the U.A.E provided on the Temu app, and was informed that the parcel would be delivered the next day. However, despite multiple promises from different agents, my parcel was never delivered. The customer service agents at the Qatar delivery company located in Industrial area were rude and consistently ignored my calls and messages.

"We ordered a TV Stand from Temu. It was delivered on time but when we tried to assemble it the screws for Step 1 were missing. We contacted Temu and they refunded us about 1/3 of the cost but offered no help on the missing screws. Luckily we were able to find them at the hardware store. Step 1 was completed. On Step 2 we discovered that the face board was totally drilled wrong and warped. So we could go no further. Temu kept saying they were working on a solution over the course of 3 weeks. Their solution was to send us a total set of screw ?? This did not help us with the face board. Temu would not refund the money and wanted us to ship the item - a TV Stand! - back. This weighed at least 100 lbs. and would be difficult to repack and bring to UPS, which is what they wanted us to do.We went a different route and are now convinced that we will NEVER order from Temu again!!",1,11/02/2023

In the beginning Temu treat you like VIP...offer you discounts and even 99% off items....after you get used to shop they treat you like garbage...Temu does not value old and loyal customers.They even have the minimum limit of checkouts which is different for every customer...since I was the old customer they keep on applying the maximum limit for my checkout unlike my friend's new account for them the limit is less..Temu is biased for every customer differently.The reason of limit restrictions they give is the cost on the package they have to pay....although their packaging is the worst...most of the items are damaged specially if its a boxed item then don't ever think you will get the box undamaged...Temu really disappointed me their customer service sucks and never helping in giving explanations...Most of the time its only automated replies.After writing this review Temu contacted me through Trust pilot and asked me to be more specific about my problemsTo be specific..I have the major issue in buying the discounted offers like 90 or 99 percent off items because i cannot checkout due to the minimum limit restrictions of 35 dollars..And Many of my friends who are Temu customers told me that they have checkout limit 20 or 15 dollars.So my major issue is that why they are charging me the more in order to checkout...This is not fair at all that i need to spend 35 dollars at any cost even if i need to buy only 10 or 15 dollar items.,1,16/02/2023

"Where to start, I ordered from temu on the 13th June, the order was split into 3 parcels, the first one due on 19th June. I checked the temu site to see when it would be delivered(as had no emails either from temu or evri the courier) and it said it was delivered by evri earlier that day with a picture of it just left by my front door, went to check and it was gone so obviously stolen, I gave evri feedback to say because my parcel was left outside it had been stolen, bare in mind I was in all day and they couldn't be bothered to knock on my door(I also have dogs who would of barked had they of knocked) contacted temu right away to let them know what had happened yet they refuse to listen or help let alone take responsibility for the stolen parcel. I have been on the temu chat daily for over a week trying to get it sorted also emailed them countless times yet they keep fobbing me off saying as evri says its been delivered they can't offer me a refund. I have told them a picture of the parcel sat outside my door is not proof of delivery and as they are the merchant and my contract is with them its there duty to sort this out but as of yet they are refusing. why should I pay for goods not received? I have also stated to them that I never gave evri instructions to leave parcels outside my house, I have told evri before to always knock on my door as I live in a dodgy neighbourhood. I'm now at my wits end as no one is helping me solve this issue. I have been lied to with two agents mentioning a refund then get emails saying the same copy and pasted replied emails saying the same, after our extensive investigation the goods were delivered therefore we regret you wont be getting a refund or reshipment. no matter how many times I tell them I never got it because evri left it outside because they never knocked and it was stolen Temu still wont listen or take responsibility for it, no matter how many times I tell them a photo of it dumped outside my house isn't proof of delivery they still wont help or refund me, so I am now ??48.19 out of pocket for that first missing parcel.. heres an extra kicker, despite me telling evri about the missing first parcel they did the same with parcel two, left it outside my house without even knocking on my door. thankfully that parcel hadn't been stolen yet when I checked but its still pretty disgusting that temu aren't refunding me for the first stolen parcel. I am now going to write to Temu head office in Dublin(as sadly there is no phone number) explaining the situation and will be given them all the customer service agents names who have fobbed me off for over a week without helping me, and also will contact Trading standards as its Temus responsibility to make sure items I've paid for arrive. I feel frustrated deflated and angry at the treatment given by Temu customer services and certainly will never shop with them again. the reviews here for temu aren't mostly good either so that should tell you something. avoid this company Edit. the reply from temu was another way to make themselves look like they are doing something, in truth they are still sending me the same copy and pasted emails stating I would not be getting a refund, to the point now it could be classed as harassment as I've already received three so far today despite me telling them to stop. again avoid this shambles of a company.",1,16/02/2023

I have had no problem buying and returning any items that were not suitable and have been purchasing items since last year.  When I needed to speak to someone they called me and were extremely helpful.  So far I have been pleased with most items. Clothes that weren't suited to me were easy to return.  The tracking is excellent and they keep you updated.  They also credit if the parcel is late even when it is only a day late which I think is great.  I wish that the review for clothes gave sizes of customers and maybe photos so that it makes it easier to choose the correct size and also to see if it's going to be suited. Any clothing I have bought has been good quality and has washed up well. Other than that I am content and have just purchased a few more items.,5,18/02/2023

DO NOT ORDER FROM TEMU! I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY ORDER AND THEY ARE NOT REFUNDING OR SENDING A REPLACEMENT,1,22/02/2023
Thought I would give them a try instead of using Shein. As with all suppliers  finding what you want very time-consuming as they stock so many versions of what you want.Easy buying process but as there was a minimum ??15 spend for free postage I ended up 3 instead of the 2 I could have bought from Amazon so buy 2 get 1 free wasn't bad.Not too long a wait but sadly items weren't suitable so returned.With Shein you can drop them at a locker but with Temu it's either Evri or Royal Mail so not so convenient.It's a few more days before i can get to post so can't comment on any problems with refunding but will certainly be reducing the 3 to 2 stars if there is.,3,22/02/2023
Was alright at first but when I received an order and items were missing and 1 item not as described temu did not care one bit about it they are quick enough to take your money but when things go wrong they don't want to know and they say they are there to help there customers will not be buying from them again will  going else where to spend my money they just proved they are out to con and rip people off. I think they don't realise that customer is always right but they don't see it like that,1,22/02/2023

I got on chatbot and told them to cancel my order because the price listed was not what I paid, they kept jerking me around and got two different chat bots to help me, I told them I wanted by money back. They had me click cancel order and I have yet to get my refund. Typical Bait and Switch routine. I went to PayPal and they have done nothing to get me my money back, yet I have interest charges continuing on my credit card. FOR ALL THAT IS HOLY, DO NOT USE TEMU.",1,22/02/2023

They took one  order and split it into several orders and charged me 18.00 in shipping. Temu started out great but now they are very bad. I will not use them again.They have  a min. order for the local warehouse  but it turns  out it is not a local warehouse  but a lot of different vendors. Each vendor has their own minimum  order.Temu takes your  order and splits it to each vendor so you do not make the minimum  order and you are charged shipping  for each vendor. Temu does not notify  you on what they have done.,1,22/02/2023
"I thought that as I reached 60 years of age  I believed I heard it all but Temu excuses are unbelievable. I was notified that it was out of their control that a package arrived at my home 5 days late , they want me to believe that they are not liable for the courier they chose to do the delivery. So we are to blame because a package arrives in Malta then get delivered 5 days after . Good job Temu you are the worst Is that your reply ? Aren?€?t you ashamed of yourselves , you seem to think people are stupid or something. From all the messages and emails exchanged you never reply directly to the questions asked. Guess its because you know what a terrible service you provide.",1,22/02/2023

"It actually works!I ordered some small tool for adjusting my wrist watch. I could track the delivery all the way and the delivery was even free!!That's pretty amazing!Temu do have a lot of annoying adds and they will spam your email back to the stone age if you don't unsubscribe, but that's a minor inconvenience for the great value for money they provide.",5,22/02/2023

"Really upset with temu! I got a package that had a big slit in it and was missing half my order, even had an empty baggy mixed in with whatever items I did get. Temu said package was fine when it left them so no refund and nothing else they can do. So now I'm down ??20+ and not the items I PAID for!!!Had nothing but bad experiences, my first order was delivered outside and stolen!Edit: temu asked below for me to contact them.

They have a reward program in that they say we can choose many items for free, all we need to do is join through any invitation link, after choosing those products , it will say our product is ready for delivery and we have to give our address etc. Then finally it will say there is something called Energy lol to get energy we need to find people n make them join with this crap. for that there is a time limit, if we cant make them join within this period we will not get gifts. y cant they say this information before choosing the gifts. y tricking people like this. this is haraam. I am thinking to file legal action against this company for tricking and deceiving people. All their promotions r like this. we will become a cheater in front of our friends when we send the link to make them join. Its a time waste.

The products are somewhat good in quality but the shipping is rediculous. It?€?s a nightmare to tell you the truth. The products I was promised to receive never came in time and was five days late on the promised date. That is unacceptable for many customers including myself. Temu needs to improve their shipping so the company gets better. You?€?re asking for a reference number. Where do I get this for I don?€?t see it anywhere???,1,27/02/2023

One purchase arrived a month late, another item I bought did not arrived and when I checked, it showed it had not shipped so I contacted the seller and was told the item was no longer available.  On 3 occasions I found out items I purchased would be delayed.  Today I received a package that was to contain 35 panels of decorative garden fence however it only contained 10 panels.  The seller showed item was no longer available so I have to repackage and bring item to delivery company to return then wait for refund while once again shopping around for item.

Package arrived with items missing due to the packaging being damaged and ripped in transport. Contacted TEMU via their live chat and what an absolute shower of ???? I sent evidence of the ripped packaging and still they will not send me replacements for missing items or help me any further! Just sending me a load of copy and paste ???? ???? TEMU are con artists! I will now go through to my bank and do a chargeback and get a refund there seen as they don?€?t want to replace missing items in transport. I will NOT be ordering from here again and suggest no one else does as when it goes wrong they will NOT help.

And your customer service was just bad. You gave me some bad excuse: ""Temu has established this requirement to provide our customers a wider selection of lower priced items. and that the order amount might change periodically due to factors like promotions or discounts.""I find it totally unacceptable that you increase the Minimum amount you want people to pay, just so you can make more discounts and promotions (then its not really a promotion or discount)I am Sad to say this but I'm done with Temu, which is sad since I have a LOT of things I want to buy. and it's perfect for people like me who have a really low income.",2,28/02/2023

I have bought household objects and adults womens clothing and been really happy with nearly all of them. There sizes are pretty true to the label as well. I have even bought a couple of kaftans that are identicle to ones purchased from Amazon but at under half the price. I think many people who complain are just plain snobbish and don't want to admit to buying quality items at the low prices of Temu. I however will keep on purchasing from them. Another thing is that when on the odd occasion there has been a problem and I have complained they are super quick to give refunds and without any hassle.,5,02/03/2023

TEMU scamI?€?ve been buying stuff regularly on this site. Today they offered me special credits of ??90 if I place an order. So I placed an order of ??20 and they never sent any credit to my TEMU account. I?€?ve tried to solve the issue in online chat but it didn?€?t worked out I?€?ve placed order twice yesterday. Chatted with customer service for 30min. Twice I had to cancel the orders because TEMU?€?s logic of credits are not explained clearly before the checkout. To be honest no one have time to read all those non sense of terms and conditions. So cutting short they are just playing with people.,1,03/03/2023
I played over 10 games invited more than 15 people and they all accepted and everytime I'm Close to getting 100% off for my items it starts getting unfair. like that game of watering plants all i needed was R100 and i was almost there. than right after watering the plant to 100% it gives me R50 knowing i won't have enough water left. mxmi feel like this app is a disappointment and it does not deserve loyalty from any customer.,1,03/03/2023

Awful ads. I've reported so many of them on Tumblr due to flashing or fast moving images that unexpectedly show up on my dash. Now recently they are also AUTO PLAYING SOUND even though I have SOUND OFF on videos and no other ads or dashboard videos are playing sound. For someone with sensory issues it is a NIGHTMARE. Will never buy anything from them.,1,03/03/2023
Yeah - some of the stuff is rubbish and they do bombard you with emails and the orders are a  bit slow to turn up - but most of the items I have bought have been fantastic value and their money back guarantee is second to none.My whole family and many of my friends are regular shoppers with them and I heartily recommend Temu to anyone.,5,03/03/2023
"Horrible experience. Refunded my money to Temu credit and not back to my bank account. Also got faulty product which caused a big damage to my expensive item.

"I've been shopping w/ Temu for about 5 months now and have had amazing deals on things from swimsuits, to coats, pants, boots, shoes, housewares, fun jewelry, etc.  Most of the items are good quality w/ a small percentage being a bit off on ""long sleeves"" being too long.  Used to get 1 return per order without having to physically return anything but recently had to physically return items via UPS (pre-paid label) so all good there.  I'd say about 89% of orders were pretty good.  I'd give 4.5 stars if I could instead of 4.  I rarely give 5 stars to anyone",4,04/03/2023

"Temu shut down my account because their Chat refused to accept written proof showing full payment of a charge that my bank mistakenly withheld.  I submitted a letter at Temu?€?s request to Temu from my bank confirming the bank?€?s error, along with bank statements showing Temu was paid for all charges.  Temu then wanted another letter from the bank, but would not tell me what amount was allegedly owing or what date.  Temu Chat dragged this out for weeks.  The Director of Customer Care in the Temu Boston office does not respond to her written letters and documentation.  Temu needs to substitute Chat representatives and their Escalation Team, along with their Director of Customer Care, for real people who comprehend a fairly simple situation.Hilarious!  Went back on Chat because they are so eager to help.  Agent Jude never even read one line of history!  AliExpress, my new best friend...",1,04/03/2023

"I live in the UK and wanted a couple of pillows for my neck as I have multiple disabilities. Obviously I have heard about Temu but always a bit sceptical, and wondered if the products would be decent, also if they would arrive. I looked on the site and read every review on these pillows. They cost ??22 for a pair. The delivery was free. They use Evri to deliver once here in the UK. I was very impressed once ticking the box, that I had lots of emails at every stage of my delivery.The delivery was quick, from ordering to the delivery, took 6 days.From ordering to the home delivery, my pillows arrived. I opened up, and let them breathe, and I have to say the best pillows I have ever had, and they do not go flat. No neck pain at all. They are beautiful, and now going to order more. I have since ordered some make up and some signs for my garden. Again all notified via email or text. Some things aren?€?t any cheaper than the UK, but with the cost of living currently, Temu have been a great asset. I bought pillows from a medical store for ??300 and were rubbish?€? these were around ??11 each and the best I have laid on.All in all a great experience, and one I?€?ll be using again.Thank you Temu.",5,05/03/2023

In other words Temu sells junk and on a big scale.",1,05/03/2023
Not to be trusted.. I have ordered things in bulk severally and paid the full amount but they didn?€?t deliver all the things that I had ordered and paid for.. and the worst thing is it?€?s so hard to communicate with them.I would advise only use COD but don?€?t pay before you confirm that all the items have been delivered.,2,05/03/2023

And now they are saying the 4th order was delivered. I have a box at my front door in a very secure area. Can you please send me a photo of the last delivery.

"I have been shopping with Temu for over a year. I can honestly say I t?€?s the best shopping experience I?€?ve ever had. You get what you pay! And I have had decent products. Anything I don?€?t want, I return, get my money back, promptly. And late deliveries, past the promised ten days, I get ??4 reimbursed for a minimum shop of ??15. In the past it used to be ??5 for a minimum shop of ??10. More often, products arrive from China in a week. My only complaint is the constant barrage of info re what?€?s on offer, and especially on anything I show interest in. It can be very annoying!But overall I am very happy with Temu and I can see why it?€?s becoming such a threat to businesses in the west. Ironically, nearly all the products we buy originate from China, with huge markups.Now those same products are coming to me, far, far cheaper!No doubt, as the company progresses, the prices will go up. I am already seeing it happening. Meanwhile, Temu is my mainstay!!",4,07/03/2023

"Several weeks later, still no goods and no sign of them. I'm told they're in some distribution centre God only knows where. Meanwhile they're bombarding me with pop ups on my phone offering further discounts. CONSTANT SPAM. BUT STILL NO SIGN OF MY FIRST ORDER! Loads of excuses and platitudes when I talk to their robot AI (supposedly a real person). It comes up with the same drivel and excuses every time. I demanded a refund WHICH I STILL HAVE NOT GOT. So no hair decoration for my daughter's wedding plus the other items I wanted with little time to get something else. Meanwhile they're spamming my phone with annoying pop ups offering all sorts of wondrous (and most likely fictitious) promises and offers. DO NOT, I REPEAT, NOT USE THIS  COMPANY! Also I think the good reviews here are written by Temu robots, the same ones that are spamming my phone. Absolutely useless!",1,07/03/2023
Have recently used Temu and Shein to buy clothes. Some of the clothes are available on both sites but I found that Shein had a far bigger choice and in most cases were much cheaper. I will continue to use both sites but I end up buying more from Shein because of the bigger choice and in most cases cheaper prices.,3,07/03/2023
"My parcel was delivered via Evri while I was out, and no one was there to receive it. The driver left the item outside without any note and didn?€?t bother to leave it with a neighbor. I contacted customer services to let them know and explained that I have looked everywhere, including behind the bins, and asked neighbors who said they haven?€?t seen the package. After 24 hours, I received their reply, which indicated that after investigation, they wouldn?€?t be able to offer a reshipment or refund. I am totally unhappy charging for items that I haven?€?t received and could be stolen",1,07/03/2023
Do not use this service its a scam.I ordered and paid for 6 items and received only 4.When I quizzed them about this I was told by their customer service agent Beatrice that there's nothing they can do and wouldn't refund or at the very least resend the item,1,07/03/2023

I bought a none slip mat for the kitchen as I was scared of my wife tripping on the one we have as it keeps slipping and bunching up.     The mat that Temu sent me does not meet the description in any way especially the none slip part when it came it was folded so small and in such a way that it was even hard to get the packaging off and when I eventually did the mat was so full of creases that it will take ages to get it to sit flat if ever plus the quality is very poor.i have shopped with Temu for a while now and agree with other reviews a lot of what I ordered in the past has either came broken or not as described I have now came to the stage after receiving this order is that I will not be ordering with them again most of what I have received in the past has been poor quality and would not have purchased these items had I known the quality they are very good at disguising their items to look good but when you get them they are pure rubbish and I would go as far to say that a very high percentage of their customers would agree with me probably a Chinese company.,1,08/03/2023
"My recent encounter with Temu's customer service was absolutely infuriating. I was ""assisted"" by a representative named Mays, who left me hanging for a staggering 15 minutes with zero communication. It felt like I was talking to a brick wall.This level of service is completely unacceptable. The blatant disregard for my time and the lack of basic courtesy are astonishing. Temu's customer service is a joke, and Mays's incompetence is a glaring example of their failing system.I urge anyone considering Temu to think twice. They clearly don't value their customers, and until they make drastic improvements, I cannot in good conscience recommend their services. This experience was beyond disappointing ?€? it was an insult. Because of this, I will not be placing any new orders with Temu",1,08/03/2023

"Careful! First gave me a chance to roll a luck spinning and on second chance offered a coupon of 250$ if I buy 3 items, but gave only 10 minutes to decide which 3 items to buy from an predefined list of items. I Bought. To use the coupon you need to spend huge amounts to get the 250$ discount 620$ in total in form of bundle. This 250$ offer should be used in 2 days. The catch is to make you think you winning something first, then the put you under pressure. In the end will be the same if you keep searching online for different options and buy without any pressure of time or date limits.",1,08/03/2023

"BEWARE!  Temu is broadcasting an email to its customers informing us of a change to their ""Terms of Service"", to take effect on July 5th, 2024 which specifies that the mere act of placing an order with them, on or after that date, restricts us to Binding Arbitration, in place of our right to bring suit individually or as a class (Section 19 et al).Section 19.3 says specifically that we WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.You can ""opt out"", but you have only 30 days to do that, and you can't use their email method. You have to send them a specifically detailed letter via the postal service. (par 19.10)That ""Terms of Use"" document refers to Temu as a ""SERVICE"" in multiple places.  I thought they were a retail seller of merchandise.

I placed an order PO-210-05357041679993668 on 21/05 and it was delivered with multiple damages after a month time. This is such a disappointment and completely wast of time. I shared the pictures with TEMU customer support and got worst response. The customer support asked me to return the item which I am okay with it. However they mentioned they won?€?t return the full amount back to my payment card.Example: if you buy an item from TEMU for ??35 and it was shipped by land. During the shipping period the price dropped to ??25. TEMU refunds the adjusted price to TEMU credit. There is no option available to refund the adjusted money back to payment card.If you return the item even though it was arrived damaged then TEMU won?€?t return you ??35 rather they will refund ??25 back to payment card and ??10 in TEMU credit. So they will hold your money illegally to make you purchase more. A con business model. This is called customer looping. The customer support told me due to security reasons they won?€?t transfer the TEMU back to my payment card and then the supervisor told due to the time past they won?€?t be able to transfer the credit. Strange I received the package today and reported immediately. What if I don?€?t want to buy the same item and don?€?t want to buy anything from TEMU. My money is gone. This is completely illegal and I have never seen this kind of behavior from any retail shop.,1,09/03/2023

Temu would not honour their code they had just sent me & said it was expired. It had 14 hrs left on it though. They apologised & said they want to help & empathise all whilst continuing to lie. Only offered a small discount as I'd cancelled a previous order & wouldn't honour the code they sent me. They make rules up as they go along & break trading standard rules & the law. Got refunds ok but sorely disappointed for all the wasted time & lies. It's corrupt. Not shopping with them again due to principle & they won't honour their promise.

They only have access through a live chat, no telephone number, and the live chat is a joke as when they cannot answer a question they send you a template response over and over again.

"Bought little things often. All was fine until?€? ordered some clothes. Over $160.00. They didn?€?t fit and material was marginal to poor. So we packed it up in a big box and returned it. Long story short, temu said they never received it. Then they said they did but only one shirt was in there. Then again said they never received it. Had me send proof of return. I did, then proof of this and that. I did ALL. Then they had me resend again. I did. Time went by. Finally in the end after months they said denied, when I sent all information to them when they requested it. They were dishonest and ran me around in circles and denied it in the end?€?. To top off my loss, now they said I ordered something I didn?€?t and withdrew money from my account. I unlinked it but over $100 was stolen out of my account. Please beware of these people.",1,11/03/2023
"Extremely misleading & deceitful. They say you've ""won"" prizes and have free shipping.They have you go and select them and everything. but it's impossible to get them because you have to f****** farm for who knows how long, virtual watering plants. After hours you get nowhere, stuck at 99%. Just let me buy stuff.  Stop pushing fake ""bonus"" crap",1,12/03/2023
"DO NOT TRUST this company they are crooks and cheating..Just made a mistake and pressed wrong button and I have ordered everything was in my cart. Realised immediately my mistake and tried to contact them and explained to them what happened.Of course they didn?€?t give a f@ck as they are there only to grab your money.Got plenty of messages from them that they are sorry and they are going to offer me opportunities to make up with offers to buy more in a very cheap too cheap.Got a message from them telling me that my order will be later than expected code they got problems with suppliers.Well don?€?t expect to get nothing from them.Just lost ?? 69.Go to safer supliers E bay, Amazon or any where is trusted and safe.Too cheap is unsafe..Please please B careful.Temu is a very unsafe online place to buy.",1,12/03/2023
"Feeling a little sketchy, funds taken out! Confirmation was sent, but tracking numbers are not valid at this time. For a few bucks more Amazon has all the same things and is honest and abrupt about shipping even from china!

"I really am disappointed in temu. Like I ordered from you guys and got stuff delivered. I am just disappointed with your mind games. Like a friend of mine sent a link said play this game. I won 6 free prices they intentionally asked me to get 0,7 energy when it was time to give me the free items until time ended like I hate mind games.  I really do. Like don?€?t play games I buy from you in your customer I trust you because I?€?ve ordered from you it?€?s best to find better ways to get more customers than play mind games with your customers promising them they will win if they share your link and than we share get you more people and you waste our time. That?€?s not good business I won?€?t order from temu again because of that. Yes I love honesty. The fact that I sat for hours inviting people than only for you to not play your part that?€?s sad. Especially because we adults. I?€?m disappointed shame I really am.",1,12/03/2023
"I've been a customer for more than a year now or whenever Temu started business online.  Bad experience I had was the mini juicer which is very cheap.  So I was tempted to order it.  It works for a while, but there's time that it got stuck while in the process, I patiently checked what's wrong.  re-charged it then it works a bit then stuck again until I got tired.  I finally made my first review to the company and made a complaint.  So, whenever you make a complain, the company would refund the money and keep the product. (I didn't keep it, I threw it away)  So, I noticed most of their electronics are low quality (being honest here) as they say...enjoy the price or get what you paid.  But...there are items that I like though, because I love fancy jewelries so most of my orders are either earrings or bracelets.  Their fake jade looks so real compared to the local store in our state which is way cheaper but same brand.  Then other items I like are their eyeglasses.  My young adult son is very satisfied, and he said, looks more elegant and way cheaper than the one he bought from Target with the same brand. Yes, I agree with other's comments that the 50 to 100% discount only apply to new customers.  They ask you to refer a friend to get gifts, I did refer more than 5 friends & relatives already and they are now active customers that even their families are now customers BUT I DIDN'T GET NOTHING FOR REFERING THEM. I'm fine with that thought. Temu knows how to play around and gain customers?????€??????? I still have my recent orders that won't work no matter what.  No more time to go to the App and make some comment.",3,12/03/2023
"I returned a nail fungus laser that was about $32. Simply did nothing for the condition. They sent me  a prepaid UPS label, I enclosed all the original items plus packaging even the original carboard box, dropped it off at ups and waited. A week later, got an email, they received but needs to be inspected. A week later got an email the box was empty. Huh? I filled the box and sealed it. Either they are lying or the UPS guy stole it or the warehouse guy stole it. Either way, they denied my refund. I filed claim with paypal. They said , if you remove the chargeback, we will refund you. I removed the chargeback. Still no refund. They keep saying if you send us back the item we will refund you. Pure BS. I cannot refile with paypal, so now I will try the credit card company attached to my paypal. Even if I had taken video of the item in the package, they would still not have believed me . I asked them to show me the packaging to see if it was torn . they refused. Beware! Now I don't have the POS item and I'm out 32$.",1,13/03/2023
"So I have ordered from Temu for a while now. When there is no problem on my deliveries, there is no complaint. So I bought some more things these past few months and had some missing items. Temu refunded my money for the first items that were missing. Then another item was not refunded but I still purchased things. Now I just bought some items about a month ago and was missing like 8 to 10 items. When I reached out to Temu they said that they will not be refunding or crediting my account because they said it was delivered and also that they checked and have proof that my items were sent out. I even give them a picture of the items that were sent and still nothing. So I contacted the delivery company OnTrac and filed a claim with them as well as my cards company. I won?€?t be shopping with Temu anymore cause all of this difficulty for things and money I lost is just not fare. So beware you might get a refund the first time but afterwards they not gonna help you if you are missing things from your purchase! F U TEMU!!!????",1,13/03/2023
My goods arrived on time as promised and even sometime a little earlier.Received all my merchandise in good standingMerchandise was as advertised.Sizing was a bit different and the Large was sometimes too big.Will keep on ordering from Temu !,4,13/03/2023
I ordered a number of things and was sent new offers and ordered more and again more. These totalled nearly 100 euros. BUT despite staying in all day for 3 days I have only received notification that they were unable to deliver despite 3 separate promises of that day delivery. Then I received a 100% refund coupon with a date 4 days in the future but when I clicked on it. Guess what it had expired. So I am 200 euros the poorer and NO order ever received. Iny opinion they are a con.,1,13/03/2023
"Packages missing.My parcels were delivered to my residence June 19, 2024. There were 3 packages, and I only received 1 packages. I love shopping with Temu, but would like to receive my packages to my mailbox. Thank you.",4,13/03/2023
"I've had a number of items from Temu & plus I'm very lucky to have a excellent 5 ??? courier delivering for Evri.(Some of Evri couriers are - no comment)Some of the products can be of low quality but l personally would say the majority 95% are excellent, l've only had one negative experience & that was caused by a relief courier & my item disappeared into the Ether & l have my thoughts were the package had gone. ???????????? but I was quickly refunded by Temu. ????",5,14/03/2023
"Temu can be odd. There's certain things you can get for cheaper on Temu than elsewhere, and generally for most products you'll at least get a knock-off or something similar. That is rarely the case when it comes to clothes. Thought I'd try my hand ordering 150 quid's worth of clothes. Should have realized Temu is no different to the others like Geekbuy and Alibaba. I got a plastic raincover hoody that was described as 'casual and stylish' that looked nothing like it's original. A 'stylish summer shirt' that looks like it was taken from Chairman Mao's collection of shirts. In fact wearing it, I feel like I should praise the communist party!So yeah avoid Temu in general and only use them for the cheap stuff.",1,14/03/2023
"Scam! My AMEX started getting weird charges that I didn't do ""suddenly"" after my first purchase at TEMU.Never had this before. and people than told me that's a common thing that they sell your CC details on the dark web.needless to say I canceled my card the day after and also my order.F you Temu! I rather pay double to honest people and never pay you another cent.",1,14/03/2023
"I am shocked to read so many bad reviews!I have had many packages delivered usually on average  within 12 days or before never later... earlier this month I sent my first return package free without a problem it turns out I had miss calculated one item Temu informed me of my error and deposited the amount for this item $18.26 into my bank account I was very impressed! I would have been none the wiser without the honesty of Temu. Also as a one off gesture they allowed me to access my return credit before they inspected the returned goods.I simply cannot ask for better customer service than that!! I am very graceful I have purchased many household items and clothes from Temu with much success, the only reason for any returns have been because of sizing on my part or the material wasn?€?t what I expected?€?plus one damaged item a rug which I have returned today for a full credit refund.. no postal charge!! Which I was delighted with.Just for the record I requested a credit on my account rather than a refund into my bank accountI am a real person/customer and I live in Australia.I am absolutely thrilled with this company and its customer service I also plan to keep on shopping!!  Happy and very satisfied customer!????",5,14/03/2023
"Worst customer service ever. I received two 50 lb items, packaged and shipped in their own boxes.I needed to return them but Temu would only send 1 return label. I called them advising I needed 2 return labels and they told me to print the label twice and attach it to both boxes. Then, if I incurred any additiona printing charges, to save my receipts and they would review the documents to see if I should be reimbursed!!!  UPS refused to take this shipment. Now I am battling and receiving the same response from their ""open ticket process."" Not to mention, their own website told me in 2 separate pop-ups that I could not use the same return label for both boxes. I am still battling with this inept company. How difficult can this possibly be?",1,14/03/2023

I am still waiting for your response to my parcel going missing. I did not receive the order. I have not received a response to my messages on the TEMU website. The parcel was left outside my house and gone when I got home. I have already left one review and you state that you are looking into the issue. How long does this take because I have waisted enough time trying to resolve this matter. Gary Conlon,1,14/03/2023
"Worst service, first of all u have to spend whole day to reach any customers service of their delivery service, nobody answering ur call, luckily if u get connected they will keep giving u false information with false hopes that they will contact u & u have to keep waiting for rest of ur life for their call.",1,15/03/2023
I have been very happy with the quality of over 99% of the items. I mean very happy.   They arrive in about 10 days. And are exactly what I order.,5,15/03/2023

"All good when things are running smoothly...but boy when the proverbial hits the fan BEWARE. They also edit out negative criticism for products in order that things look rosy by saying that the purchase can't be verified, yet they are more than capable of keeping and verifying the good reviews...  Was a customer and probably like many before me fell out of love for their tricks, long delays and cheating tendancies.",1,15/03/2023
"My parcel was missing 2  items. I had ordered 3 of something and only 2 were sent. Another item was not there at all. It was made more confusing as they had merged 2 orders and sent them in one package, and both orders had multiple small items in. They refused to accept that the items were not sent and my refund was denied. It did not amount to much in ?? but that?€?s not the point. *****Update Temu have done nothing and the reply link took me nowhere.  It sounds like a nice reply but it solved nothing for me!",1,15/03/2023
So far I?€?ve received every order within the advised timeframe and all products were good value.,5,15/03/2023
"After a year of shopping with Temu and multiple transactions I'm giving 3 stars. The app only favours new customers and longer you shop the more excruciating prices you get, unfortunately. There was quite a lot of orders where I received either faulty or poor quality product. What is good about Temu is that I usually get the parcel between 1-2 weeks, what's bad is rising prices and poor quality. Electronics especially, they break after week or two of usage. I now buy only things that are for my art/craft projects, little bric-a-brac, things for kitchen and clothes.",3,15/03/2023
Cheap crap that are rejects from manufacturer?€?s would not recommend,1,15/03/2023
"Increasing the minimum spend twice so far!Once again Temu say they value our custom but when my minimum went from $15 to $35 and then to $40 I contacted Temu and asked why? They responded with its an environmental issue and cost of delivery. They had no problem when it was $15! It?€?s a money grab and we should vote with our feet and simply stop buying, when it hurts their hip pocket they will drop the minimum to a the $15 they advertise on their website and stick to. Let?€?s remove the app and they will email you when they want you back!Sadly at the moment they don?€?t value us at all, it?€?s lip service only, otherwise they would have looked after us already!",1,15/03/2023
"Cheap prices, and often appear quite good items. But everything I have had breaks really quickly. Drinks bottles for me at gym and toddler all now leak after a few weeks, 5 pack of Hair clips all broken with a few weeks.  Kids toys all snapped after only 1 or 2 uses.  Summer dress was see through in the sun! Leggings shrunk in the wash. Kitchen stuff has gone rusty on the metal parts (except the peeler I brought) hair brush set, missing bristles after one use, mini side table collapses at the weight of a tea cup! Kids pjs horrible material. Glow in dark stuff doesn?€?t glow in the dark.  I Will say the solar lights are still working after 8 weeks, will see how they fare.  All the coupons always have a reason you can?€?t use them or they expect you to spend a lot of money when your on a site that?€?s obvs for people trying to save money.

Been buying from Temu for a long time and purchase iyems nearly every week. I track my deliveries and they arrive on time.  The prices are great.  No extra charges for shipping.  I am very happy with Temu.,5,16/03/2023
"I have made several orders on Temu and everything went well with all except for one part of an order that I am still waiting to receive. All others came on time. I like the price adjustment option and they give you the money back instantly. The quality of goods is so and so but this is kind of expected. I love their customer service and they should serve as a model to many! For my last order they send the wrong charging wire and when I contacted them, they instantly refunded about 80% of the price to me. Also, for the part of the order that was delayed they have fully refunded me already when I was asking why it is late. I will for sure continue to buy stuff from them.",5,16/03/2023

"I bought a pair of trainers for 15 CAD, using them every day because I don't want to wear out my Forces, Dunks, and Jordans too quickly. Won't say it's the best running shoes ever, but a decent pair for 15?Compared to Amazon, this platform is just one step less in the reselling process, less the brokerages and the storage fees. Most of the daily products one finds on Amazon can be found in Temu at a better price, except shipped directly from the other side of the world.You have to, however, consider the high cost of return, if you are not happy with the product(s). Take that risk into the calculation before you make a purchase.Remember: you will get what you pay for.",5,16/03/2023
I?€?m so mad at Temu because I returned a package every item in original packaging but they denied me for refund!! I paid $170 for nothing,1,16/03/2023
"Dreadful, is a polite way of putting it, l am still waiting for my refund, they refunded 2 small items but not the original order which we never got, they are trying to say that it has been paid but it clearly shows that this is not the case, we are just going round in circle's will never buy from them again.",1,16/03/2023
"Shocking customer service. I?€?d be embarrassed to work there. The people, if you do manage to speak to someone are following scripts and do not comprehend a simple enquiry.

"It's been almost a month since I received a package on May 26. My item was missing a part, so I called Temu support online and via phone to request that you send me the missing part. I told them exactly which part was missing by showing them a picture of the missing part. I was only getting an answer from their customer that someone would get back to you within 24 hours. But none did. And I spent almost every other day on their site chatting with their support team and giving the same answer. They will get back within 24 hours. After two weeks of getting the same answer, I returned the item and requested my refund. I shipped the package back, and the warehouse received a quality check on Jube 11th. But I'm still waiting for my refund. I have been calling them almost every other day and talking online about the refund status, but they keep saying that the warehouse is doing a quality check. Today, June 19, I have been waiting for over an hour over the phone to talk to the Supervisor, but she was not able to resolve my issue",1,17/03/2023
Scammers they sent a picture of the ornament I ordered  and another item only received one of two items notified temu denied refund really are thieves and impossible to get a refund afterwards it's cheap for a reason it's Chinese scam artists,1,17/03/2023

I ordered products over 6 weeks ago and I see a tracking number but it has been showing out for delivery since June 6th and today is June 19th.  When I contact OnTrac ( only available thru Chat) they give me no information except it's scheduled for delivery. Once they said they don't have the shipping information.

"A lot of people say don't use TEMU they scam you and nothing is what it says it is I beg to differ! I've been using the site for a while now and as long as you really look at dimensions, sizes in yr country against theirs you can get some fantastic stuff. I ordered 8 summery event dresses 1 of which I did not like on but that soon got snapped up by a mate and there sofa throws and even there hair extensions are amazing the colour match on those to my natural hair was spot on. Give them a go and follow there scam advice it's a winner for me",5,19/03/2023

They can start by changing their delivery company. Although I love the look of the clothes my first order arrived at a designated parcel shop as I was wary of their delivery company. My second order was supposed to be delivered yesterday but their delivery company couldn?€?t find the drop shop. I would be very very wary of using this company I was informed Evri couldn?€?t gain access to the drop shop ???  Temu and evri cannot even try again to deliver which doesn?€?t make sense as they have only tried once to deliver (supposedly). Lovely looking clothes at reasonable prices - probably too good to be true. All they could offer was a refund which I accepted here?€?s hoping I receive it. Ive now received a request from Temu to verify this review so I?€?ve sent them the tracking number as I could only fill in one number. With all the correspondence I?€?ve had with them (which I?€?ve screen shot) they obviously don?€?t want this review seen. They?€?ve got all my details so they can see this is a genuine review.,1,19/03/2023
"Very poor delivery, very poor customer service, delivery using EVRI is a joke.TEMU owes me over ??10 for a non delivery and refuses to pay me.  BEWARE Even though I have proved that EVRI delivered incorrectly and accept it was delivered to the wrong address, TEMU still refuses to refund my money.  Worst company to deal with BEWARE.",1,19/03/2023
"I was charged for the refunded parcel!!! I sent the screenshot from DPD service with parcel ID and all photos of the refunded items. All clothes were neatly folded in a parcel and sent through the DPD service, using the return sticker TEMU provided. Temu charged all money for the refunded items explaining what something happened with the parcel and items are not eligible for the refund.Still doesn't know what happened and who is responsible for the occurred situation. No-one from support clearly explained me what happened, just charged money from my credit card! Scammers!",1,19/03/2023
"This was my first time using Temu. When I went in there, I received notifications about the discount I was getting, then it changed to AUD120 cashback or voucher if I purchase 3 items. So, I did to a total of AUD102. The items delivered alright but I didn't want to use them yet because there is no where I can find the voucher or cash back. Please tell me how could I get the AUD120. My order id was PO-012-09709039370872272.Thank you.",1,19/03/2023
"Now I heard all the things about Temu so I don?€?t trust using my card on their app (which is a shame since you want to build a trust with your customers). Instead I used a gift card (visa) , the first time I used this method it worked but when I tried the second time Temu said they didn?€?t take that gift card as payment so I bought a different card (Mastercard) and before I bought the card I looked it up to make sure that Temu took Mastercards but when I went to the app and tried to buy something they said they didn?€?t take that form of card either. This was very frustrating so I just stopped using the app all together. Would NOT recommend.",1,19/03/2023

Such a waste of my time with nothing to show for it. They dangle ?€?coupons?€? in your face, but to use them you need to spend A LOT of money within a very short amount of time. Basically blackmailing you into spending more money. I?€?m so angry with them for conning me into doing these games and want to warn others not to bother. Their aim is not to reward you but to extort money out of you.",1,20/03/2023

"I received 2 baggage scales from Temu - one with a battery that didn?€?t fit and another without a battery. I found the Temu website too confusing when it came to complaints so I opened a dispute in PayPal who eventually advised me to get back in touch with Temu. I managed to set up a direct chat line with a Temu agent and the moment I mentioned PayPal dispute they said categorically that they coining longer discuss the matter unless the dispute was closed. Months later PayPal said there?€?s nothing they can do so I have to close the dispute and go back to Temu. Apparently it still has it listed as a PayPal dispute even though it?€?s been closed, and also stated it could take months to resolve - and it?€?s just a petty sum of money involved. I?€?m currently waiting for more orders to be delivered and might close my account after that.Some time later having sent Temu the additional information they asked for in order to deal with my issue. No response and I have to accept by now that they just wanted to create the impression of being helpful whilst actually ignoring their own culpability.",1,21/03/2023

"Bad experience with TEMU. I have placed an order and they told me that it will be delivered in 3 weeks ... I waited 3 weeks and other 3 weeks. Finally, they wrote that my package is lost and I can re-order goods. When I tried to re-order it ... Oppps ... the goods are out of stock and I can order other goods.

They are not real.It is sad, because the products I have received are often identical to Amazon and can be cheaper. Check first. Not always.But if you have a problem, the response is a form letter I don't think anyone with a working amount of English reads them.

To be honest, I wish companies based in the UK was as efficient, gave as much detail on items such as size, length etc.  Their delivery information is second to none, I am informed of the delivery every step of the way.  In all the time I have been using Temu  have only had to get a refund once and I should have known better than ordering a pair of shoes costing a couple of pounds. The quality of the clothes are great, in fact I put a Temu blouse and a well known companies blouse next to each other and our daughters in law could not tell which one was which.I will continue buying from Temu, not because of the low price of their products, but because of the efficiency and free postage (over ??20 spend) that Temu provide.",5,25/03/2023
"Psychological trickery.  I spent $80 and got 90% the way to a $150 AUD reward credit. I had 12 credits left to get. You would think that would be around $20 to get the extra 12 needed. But no, The credit reward system is based on a negative exponential curve so that the closer you get to the reward, the more difficult it is to earn the credits as in much more difficult. As in I would needed to have spent over $200 to get the extra 12 needed to get to the 150 AUD.  There must be lots of poor people who get sucked in by these tactics. When I discovered what they were doing, I promptly cancelled my order.  Let's see if I get a refund.  They try to get you to have your refund as Temu credits about five times in a row, each time getting more sneaky with how they ask you.

"Completely unusable service.Was directed to the Temu website via an ad that matched my search term perfectly.Was greeted with a huge spinning ferris wheel overlay blocking the page that I had to close to get back to the product page.Then a bunch of arrows pointing at the item from the ad. Clicked it, but instead of showing the item, the Google Play Store opened up on the Temu app.Navigated back and found the item on the regular product list, thinking this banner was some kind of shady click grabber. Clicked that, and the exact same thing happened.All product links broken, I thought I'd do them the favor and contact support to let them know their site is currently broken, at least on mobile.Found the ""Contact us"" link at the end after all the bot and Q&A support links and clicked that. A create account page opened up, but before I could click anything, an overlay with some call to action newsletter something something opened automatically and covered the screen.Got that closed, and then tried to navigate back to see if I accidentally clicked the wrong link, or some other overlay had opened up automatically and I accidentally clicked something there.To navigate back, I first had to confirm via an overlay that I really didn't want to sign up and instead miss out on all the great offers and blah blah blah. Once succeeded, I confirmed I didn't click the wrong link.For a site that literally just acts as a middleman to sell from other Chinese websites with a markup, it's bordering on insane that their website is so broken, even spamming their visitors with distractions and clickbait at a staggering rate the second they make the mistake of visiting it.Wow.

"Temu was good in the beginning. But suddenly they have increased my minimum order value from 10??? to 25???. I don't buy their nonsens about wishing to reduce shipping and environment as this seems to be in place for some customers and not for others. Or the amount seems to be different. I noticed that if I spend to much here they put up the minimum spend also. Interestingly is that if you create another account with different email, address etc then your minimum spend goes back down to original 10???. Needless to say after 20+ orders I decided to return to AliExpress where I still have the option to pay for separate shipping of single items. Temu does not offer this to me and just try to force me to fill up my order with small items I don't need to reach minimum spend value. I don't see how this kind of tactics will reduce waste or help the environment one bit, producing items nobody wants. So my experience is to stay far away from Temu and their horrible way to treat customers.",1,26/03/2023

I'm pleased to say that all of my orders have been delivered by Evri, who I find to be extremely reliable.

"So I'm sitting on the fence at the moment with temu, it seems to be ok with the goods on offer out there with some weird & wonderful things you didn't think you needed or thought existed & at seems to be ok prices, BUT look at this as like a gambling site because imho it could get addictive, but why I'm here is to warn others to avoid any promos, i am new to temu & i took advantage of a 90% discount for first time users, lets just say it was more like a 60-70% discount plus you don't get the discount on everything on you first order, it was so confusing on what i was getting discount on & what i wasn't, any i thought i was spending just over ??10 for a few discounted items but by the time i pay by paypal the bill come to just over ??40, only released this after i had paid,,,,it looked like my checkout invoice was ??40 but with the discount it would come to ??10, now in my head this is not a 90% discount & the invoice is confusing & made me believe i was paying less than i actually paid! FUN SITE BUT BEWARE IT IS CONFUSING ON THE CHECKOUT WITH PROMOS!!!!! So here is an example: everything for ??1 voucher/rewared,,,so i go to pock something for a ??1 item but when i come to buy the item it would still cost me ??9.38, so it's a false promotion! I rest my case, beware of their bull promos!",3,27/03/2023

So basically scammed by the seller through mis selling/mis describing the item. So send it back I thought. Well that seemingly is going to take weeks before I get my refund. So Temu is basically supporting the scam. But I bet they don't even bother to contact me. But I will be writing to their C E O again much for my pleasure as again he'll no doubt ignore me. And yes I have his e m a i l addr. Bottom line Temu has once again proven it does not care about it's buyers but only about making money hand over fistUPDATE after TEMU (system generated) responseYes Temu I know how to return goods. But what I want you to do is take responsibility for the (poor and inaccurate) advertising by your sellers and in this case for me to receive the goods I had ordered based on the listing description.

Hi I am a good customer. With temu . Most things I buy if not good like bad quality I give to charity . I had a tip to send back . They sent me a qr code . Great. Then next day I had 3 bras to send back . And a top . Then sent a qr codes for them . Then an hour later they said as u are a good customer we have paid u . I went to post office with the qr code and when I pressed it it came up with we have refunded u if we don't receive the items we will charge u . So I came home tried to find how to get in contact .or a address for me to pay the returns no good so I put them in the bag with a code . With a letter inside explaining what has happened. Then yesterday I got a email saying I am not entitled  to a refund on both and they took it back. I'm not happy . I spend a lot of money with temu. I will not order from them again till this is sorted . I got to 2 bits to send back . I will stand at post office . Ask for return.

"I have appreciated almost all the items I have purchased on Temu; decent quality, good delivery, fast service. However, the promos are very questionable, don't go near them! A recent offer offered 100% discount, and the process to select and include items in the promo are highly complex, and the discount only applies not on the latest purchase, but on future purchases. In other words, a sneaky way to get customers to keep on buying ad inifinatum.

They are not reliable. The packages are delivered without a signature or proof so if they go missing they do NOT do anything about it. I rely on shein more for customer service and quality. They have replied they offer refunds which is a lie since they will not even acknowledge the fact that DHL claims the shipment could be lost or stolen. They do not have proof of delivery. So when contacted for a refund they never did give me one. But just closed me cases several times. If Temu wants update then they should review my account it's quite obvious,1,28/03/2023
I still have not received my refund back into my account and it has been weeks . I have emailed them but no response.,1,28/03/2023
I received my package  but with the wrong contents.  There's no way to contact someone directly!  they refer you back to the seller to dispute.  Poor service!  I will never order from them again.  I'll  stick to Amazon and least they stand behind their products & service.,1,28/03/2023
"I've never experienced a company who doesn't want my money. Cancelled my order without contacting me at all stating suspicious activity but then proceeded to process payment from said ""suspicious card"" and ship those orders after.I'm headed on vacation soon and was ordering stuff for the vacation and now by the time the refund processes won't be able to order so I'm left screwed over in a small town stuck using overpriced Amazon.Tried speaking to customer service about it and they just didn't care at all so I deleted my account. Definitely do not recommend dealing with this company because even when they screw up they'll just be like meh. Thanks for refunding the order without consulting me guys that money definitely won't be headed back your direction after this.",1,28/03/2023
"Went through ordering process for first time and was just about to put card details in when I got message about ??15 minimum order.

"I order from Temu.com many times, but this  time is really disappointing, I order goods around 393 from Temu, but never received any packages,the courier claimed it?€?s delivered and posted an wrong picture with no relevance to my address And they refusing to help me find my order which is extremely important that I get it They refused  creating tickets asking to just re order which I can?€?t and I don?€?t want it ,I just need my order delivered The whole experience is been disappointing and bad ????",1,29/03/2023

They don't honor their referral program I invited about 20 people and they only counted like six of them said that the rest of them didn't count because It's up to TEMU If you were referrals count or not so in other words they don't want to give away free stuff they won't even know they offer it,1,29/03/2023

"Deplorable. I?€?d rate them in the negative if it was an option. Was supposed to receive a credit for a delivery that was late, the frustration of trying to have a conversation with CS, their lack of actually reading the conversation, was so frustrating it would never amount to the credit for the time wasted and frustration, nor their lack of follow through. Poor service, poor communication, lack of follow through all for cheap products. Save yourself the frustration.",1,29/03/2023

"Buyers beware!  I?€?ve bought several items from this company. A large waterproof picnic blanket which was definitely NOT waterproof and at best water resistant!  A mobile phone/ear pod/Apple Watch charger which was a big fail and ended up in the bin after one week; it stopped charging, when it did charge it was super slow and overheated.  The electrical items are the worst; a lint remover which just stopped working and clearly wasn?€?t up for the job. It looks cheap, it is cheaply made and I guess you get what you pay for!",2,30/03/2023

"The customer service is terrible. I had ordered some bags for blankets, they did not come with a pump as you would expect. I requested assistance from their customer service team, after many, many requests for a solution where they would say they are working on it, they finally suggested two pumps that I had already ordered but they do not work, when I told them this they closed my chat and are no longer helping me.",1,30/03/2023
I ordered  and payed for 4 items. The 2 lesser expensive  items were delivered but the 2 more expensive items were not. I could not get in contact with anyone.  I could only chat online and the only response was check with the carrier. No more Temu for me.,1,30/03/2023
Temu has pulled the old bait & switch on a lot of their products now. Products I was buying regularly just 6 months ago have now gone up in prices by as much as 100% to 250%. That has been happening while the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the Yuan. There's no reason for the huge price increases in products other than to make bigger profits in China. Looking across all items in many different categories on Temu and this has been the case. There's really no advantage to buying on the platform anymore as you can get most of the things here at home in the U.S. for similar prices now and not have to wait a few weeks for your order to arrive. But that's what all newer companies do now. Start with unbelievably low prices at the beginning and then continually raise prices and in Temu's case extremely high in a very short period of time.,1,30/03/2023

"Recently very aggravating and deceptive ads.  Just like any marketplace where they have different sellers there are issues that you run into with that said, as far as quality some items are great some items not so great, some items are just total garbage so you find a good seller and you stick with them basically.  Since they have come online they have added several direct outlets.  The problem that they have right now is there are many many ads that are very deceptive in their appearance an example is a Saker 4 inch mini chainsaw $20 Ad clearly shows the chainsaw and if you scroll through it shows what you might expect that would be included with the chainsaw a couple of chains, without pictures of say the battery to use the chainsaw cordless on this particular item. And it wasn't until I read reviews because Temu has a habit of only posting the five star reviews that you can actually see you have to click more reviews to see all of them. So it was only until I did that that I realized because I had seen the ad of several times and to me it appears that they it's the 4-in chainsaw with a couple of chains for $20 but once I read the reviews it's 2 Chains no chainsaw and there were many many reviews where people are very unhappy because they had two chains and no chainsaw when they thought they were going to get a chainsaw so I didn't buy it I got lucky and only because I read all the reviews and tried to figure out myself what the scoop on it is but they have many many items like that and it's very time consuming very deceptive and I'm sure they have hundreds if not thousands of people who are buying things that they think they're getting that they're not.  And what I also saw is that he move doesn't answer reviews or make exception to people who didn't get what they thought they were getting.  Another thing that's very deceptive about the website is if you don't leave a review on an item it sits there as a five star which is totally unacceptable it should be zero star until you actually rate it but that's not how the website is. And recently with them adding all these direct buyers another example is a three-piece bistro set is the picture on the ad and you see the price and you get excited but you you've got a really really research to try to figure out if it's all three pieces or if it's just the table or just the chairs and they have hundreds of ads that are a great price but the picture is not what they're selling it might show all three pieces but they're only selling the table or the only selling one chair so it's really deceptive and it's it's not good advertising and they need to really do something about it because it's confusing a lot of people and I only know that from spending the time out of my day and my life to read other people's reviews and how upset they are because they thought they were going to get a 4-in chainsaw and all they got was two chains and I ran across many many ads like that and I'm so aggravated that I'm almost done with the website literally because it's just too much aggravating deceptive BS",2,30/03/2023
"I have had 3 large parcels from Temu now,  all received well before expected date due to your despatch and Evri deliveries and kept up to date all the way through. Clothing is a bit hit and miss due to sizing, one sweat top was about 3 sizes too big and went into my charity bag.  3 pairs of earrings were described on site as 925  sterling silver but weren't.  it says on the packets silvery.  The art and craft section is excellent and so much variety and value for money.  When one garden item was broken I got a refund straight away.  Changed my mind now - customer service is useless 18th July 24",4,30/03/2023

The clothing is not very good quality, but basic items for the kids, does not have to be good quality. It will get stained and ripped no matter the quality anyways. I am satisfied with Temu",5,30/03/2023
"Ordering from Temu can be a time-consuming activity but not unpleasant. I have ordered many things and have tossed maybe 20% but at the price it is insignificant. Clothing orders are hit or miss mostly due to sizing. As I petite person, most items are too long. They do offer shorter pieces but you need to specifically look at the length. Some of my orders were things I could buy from US retailers at 4X's the price.",4,30/03/2023
I still don't get proper answers for my complaint at Temu Customers service. They all talk round and round no conclusions on my problems so basically they're quite poor with response as well. Sometimes they send messages which are not related queries! I'm so tired with that shopping website. Although Amazon is quite good than that.,1,30/03/2023

Products are fair  but delivery is getting worse considering you NOW have to have a $40 order to complete cart. Cannot order $40 all the time.Put some things in cart for a few days only $20 got a reply choose or loose so I loose. What a shame do what Aliexpress do them charge you a few dollars for deliver for items.Shein does it also. Amazon does it if you order over a certain amount free shipping but below that a fee is issued. Been buying for over 2 and a bit years spent a lot...Thanks Temu,4,01/04/2023

So I have been asked to update my review,  I can only tell you.  That upon noticing that there were transactions I did not purchase. Called my CC company and both CC lady and I went through my bill.   She was the 1 who caught where this issue went sideways.  Also I know I am still missing a couple items, or was shorted.    Am sorry this is a crappy review. I wish my experience was better.",1,01/04/2023
I really wanted to like Temu but it has been 11 days since my order and the package hasnt even left the country it is coming from. No flights apparently. And that is before it arrives and I check the goods. Also it says trackable but when I put the number in the object is not available. Disappointing so far.

"I had a flyer on my IPhone from Temu and as the prices and the discounts looked good, I decided to give them a try. Instead of processing my order promptly and earning my respect, I have been swamped with loads of further offers for more items; so much do that I have now blocked them on WhatsApp.I have now been informed that my order has been cancelled for delivery issues having been told on many occasions that my order is on the way. I have been told that my PayPal payment will be returned to me via PayPal on 14th July and I suppose if I still want the goods, I will need to order again. What a waste of time!I am still getting messages (not on WhatsApp since I blocked them) offering huge discounts) but what is the point of dealing with them if they can?€?t provide the 3 very ordinary items I ordered, due to delivery issues which have yet to be explained.If you want the items ordered in a hurry, forget the silly discount offers and order from a trusted supplier.",1,02/04/2023

I thought I would use the credit for some garden lights but am unable to access the credit so I am 30.00 down with no chance of a refund. Please do not use this company.

"Terrible customer service. For a very simple issue, they just passed me to each other for 10 days and each time asked me to explain the issue again. At the end the issue was not resolved after wasting my time for 10 days. Also be very careful with clothes, as the pictures and the size guideline could be very misleading. And the price adjustment feature is mainly for advertisement. If you use it, they will increase the minimum shoping value limit to compensate the adjustment they gave. Good points: The site is not fake and delivery time were as written.",2,03/04/2023
"Temu deals with their own delivery agents who I have on video surveillance throwing my items and damaging them. Temu doesn't refund or replace these items.

"UPDATE #2 I just received my package in the mail - my sincerest apologies to Temu regarding or implying that they ""steal, stole"" from me. My Complaint however was  about ""Customer Service"". I stand by that portion of initial complaint: They have horrible customer service should problems arise with your Order. RE Delivery Status Error or Fraud by USPS.UPDATE: Temu response sent stating customer service of Utmost Importance... NO IT IS NOT ???? ????!That very customer service they speak of is why I wrote my Review! They respond cute to reviews but personal experience has me beginning to differ.I stand firm in my ""Initial Review of Temu"" They are Dishonest Merchants with Horrible Customer Service!Temu has unlimited great products at unbeatable prices, however, I'm not paying ANYBODY to Disrespect me and steal my money.This last sale ends my Business with Temu. I recommend YOU not risk your money shopping at Temu!??? ??? ??? DONE ??? ??? ??? I have been ordering from TEMU for some years now with pretty good results. However, When I placed multiple orders within a 3-5 Day period, I had a few separate shipments coming.I was supposed to receive a package to day. I noticed the Tracking Report said ""Delivered"". I did not receive the package. I contacted Temu and Informed them that I did not receive the package.Their first assumption was that I was lying to get another package free. How's that for Customer Service?Then they told me ""Go door to door ???????????? to your neighbors and ask about the package.I was furious at the treatment I was receiving and asked for a full refund for all orders NOT Received! They started to go into the cat and mouse game again with no resolution. It was then I realized Temu is not an honored Vendor or an Responsible or a Accountable one to it's many Customers that feed their greedy little pockets.I decided to chalk the money up as a loss and NEVER do business with Temu again!The Federal Government warned us some time last year about dangers: Identity Theft, Theft, Fraudulent charges and who knows what other harm they are doing to other Consumers.Don't Take a Chance with your money, DO NOT SHOP AT: TemuThey do not honor us, don't spend your money with them!Shop Local - American Made!??? ??? ???",1,03/04/2023
"On Friday, June 10th after my closet organizer delivery, I contacted Temu thru customer chat. At which time I have provided over 10 pictures of the labels and item as requested. The item I ordered was right but the color sent is wrong. I ordered a. black unit and instead I received a conac color.  I spent well over an hour on chat doing and sending everything requested on Friday..chatting, opening the boxes shipped for more pictures, and waiting for a resolution. I was told an exchange which is what I wanted was not possible. Returning it is possible but only if it is picked up which I was told not possible. The order is two large over sized boxes weighing over 100 pounds so I had no way to get it to UPS. I was told a pick up exchange was not possible. I then agreed to a credit adjustment if pick up was not possible but have never received a message back to determine amount.

"Awful. Company is dishonest. Don?€?t purchase from them. This site uses false advertising to try to draw you in and then sets a minimum spend of $45 upwards despite advertising free delivery on all orders. They then lie about not being able to change this, even though they set different amounts for different customers. It?€?s a scam and dishonest. Don?€?t purchase from them or download their app. Delete your account for your own safety and security. Temu mines your information and data to on sell. They have recently been prosecuted for this. Don?€?t trust the supposed 5* reviews these are stacked and posted by Temu. This is a site that is deceptive and cannot be trusted. Customer service is nothing but repeated cliches of cut and paste word for word comments with no resolution. if you look at their response here to the mountain of growing complaints it?€?s very clear their responses are just cut and paste rubbish that offers no actual resolution. Previously I had recommended Temu, never again, every customer gets to this point of deleting the app and voicing their frustrations. Save yourself the trouble they can?€?t be trusted. Shop with more reputable sites, that will actually save you money in the end with better quality and genuine free shipping and no bs minimum spend. Done with Temu for good. Wise customers will do the same. I was a long term customer of Temu, and have made multiple purchases, so my comments come from genuine experience and experiencing the deterioration over time of their service and becoming alert to the scam they are running. They cannot be trusted in any way. Make sure you delete you account in Temu and then the app or they will illegally retain your information.",1,04/04/2023

I am a frequent Temu shopper.  I try to shop a little bit every two weeks to keep my wardrobe fresh. I gained a lot of weight and have had to replace most of my clothing with a larger size and this would have been financailly difficult without Temu. I find that their clothes are consistently as good as Target and sometimes as nice as Talbots clothing. The sizing took adjustment but now I know that as a 14-16 I should buy an XXlarge instead of X large in most things.  The dresses are my favorites as they are often very beautiful and easy care. Cold water wash and hang to dry. The T Shirts fabric is a blend and not as nice as 100% cotton but still tolerable. I bought a sofa cover for $30 that would have costs at least $100 and is holding up fantastic. My husband is against the site due to suspicions over China. I remind him everything else is from China in most stores any way.,5,10/04/2023

Quality of items is very hit and miss, their trainers although so much better choice wise and aesthetically great compared to the UK WHITE OR BLACK. However I bought about 10 pairs, all were warn through after about 3/5 months. Clothing is the same poorly made and obviously yours is one of thousands, Quality control is a clear issue. Also some of the advertisements are or can be very misleading and when it does arrive it?€?s disappointingly shabby cheap rubbish. I have purchased items that have gone straight in the bin as they were shocking.  The tracking for their parcels is usually great, but Evri lost Two of my parcels over the course of my membership, meaning the order had to be submitted all over again.

Apart from that I am utterly surprised how much TEMU mislead customers by sharing incorrect information about this product. TEMU site mentioned the over all product weight is 435 KG (2 chairs + 1 side table), however the actual weight of the product is max 28 KG. It?€?s extremely poor quality. TEMU customer support asked me to return for refund, which is fair. However, I requested to pickup the package from the doorstep as I am currently unable to drive and can?€?t bring the package to shipping store. I had hours and hours chat with the TEMU Customer Support, then they created a ticket, which was completely useless. I just received scripted messages again and again. No one able to understand the situation to help. They closed the ticket without resolving the issue. Such a rude behaviour. It?€?s been 17 days the issue isn?€?t resolved and the package is still laying in my lounge. This is really unethical and disgraceful situation I have to face as a TEMU customer.

"Temu's Service had dropped quite considerably . Sizing of clothing is very hit and miss. To be fair, some products I have purchased have been good value for money and are very good quality, however some are absolutely terrible and should not be sold. When an issue occurs. Rather than doing something about it they just offer a refund. Refunding DOES NOT resolve the issue. The delivery times in my opinion and based on what I know, are misleading. They have also attempted to raise the minimum order value without notification. That I have rectified. Prior to 2024 delivery was very good. I cannot say the same of recent purchases. These are just my experiences. Contacting customer service via the web site is a waste of time. All one receives is a pile of generic prearrange reply material. followed by an offer of refund in order to detach from resolving an issue. I will probably continue to by some items as the do work but my lead time will increase to avoid disappointment .

"When Temu first arrive it was great,better than any other selling site online. Now..it really sucks! The shipping would be free is you spent just 10 dollars,but now you have to spend like 30 dollars minimum, AND whats worse, they take your order, let's say 6 items totalling 30 dollars, and they break it up into 3 orders of 2 each. THEN they charge you shipping for ALL 3 orders,because each order no longer meets the requirement. Not a mistake, they did to me more than once! Yes, I did contact them and politely say,are you stupid?! You broke up my order, and you want ME to then pay extra for shipping. So my 8 dollar flashdrive was now 12 dollars with shipping. Watch out because they won't tell you they are doing that. Very low, undermining trick! Then there is the good deal never available! They sell 3 dozen of the same item, and one ad is a super great price, while the rest are just ok. You will notice, EVERY TIME you locate the super good price, it says out of stock, would you like to be notified when available. This is a scam! I found that same item, in another ad, for a higher price, AND it was available!!! I spent some hours on this site discovering these things. Most of the good items are overpriced or not available and with the new shipping scam, it makes the item higher than walmart prices. What's worse, the ""notify me"" is also complete scam. I clicked on notify me with 3 dozen items in 6 months and not one ever notified me it was available. I then found said item at a higher price. So it's not that they didn't have the item, they just didn't have for a good price. I am finding other scams, like if the item is on TikTok for 30 bucks, Temu will have for $25. But check on Goigle and it's 3 dollars! Don't assume these 2 sites are the lowest! Don't even get me started on how they ship the items. Every metal sign arrives bent, etc. I'm not saying don't shop on these sites, I'm just saying don't rush to buy the item because you think the price is great and are worried it won't be available anywhere else. Every item they said ran out, will notify you, I ended up getting on another site for same price or less! Hope my endless hours of research has helped my fellow Americans.",1,15/04/2023

The size is very small.And when I had several to return, they told me to keep them or give them away or donate them.Whatever I want to do with it.They refunded my purchase within seconds as a credit. Although they try to solve the problem immediately when you complain and give it lower than four stars, and they then make a 5??? rating that cant be changed. They do try to solve the problem. The only thing I had to keep doing from Dec 2023, Was to continue to write exact directions to my Mobile home. They Used UPS Or USPS.They're other delivery services SuckAlways dropped at  the door in the front of the mobile home park at the administration office and the administration office does not deliver packages to the residents. They finally got this straight.And since then I only have them ship through those two delivery companies. There is a way when you check out to pick a delivery company that meets your expectations and they will send it that way. I've had a lot of pleasurable experiences with them BUT once in a while, not so. But for the savings in items, It's well worth it. Let's be honest there isn't a company in the world that has 100%. THIS TEMU company tries to please. Be patient with the robots- lol- they don't quite understand what they were programmed for!!!????????????",3,16/04/2023
Easy to order items and kept up-to-date with the different stages of delivery.,4,16/04/2023
"I recently tried to purchase from temu, and there was a delivery attempt, instead of calling me to let me know that they had arrived they deemed it no access, I spoke to the customer service which is surprisingly good, however they said that they would not reattempt to deliver my package due to no access, I have never dealt with a courier service that only makes one attempt, now I'm out of $50 and this was my first purchase ever, do not use this garbage website.",1,16/04/2023
"If I could leave a lower than 1 star review, I would. I ordered a projector months ago but only had the opportunity to try it today. My fault for not trying during the return window. It doesn't work- says no device connected. I tried every which way I could- even tried Google for an answer. When nothing worked, I went through the ridiculous process of the Temu bot. Useless. Absolutely and utterly. No we can not refund. The product has even been discontinued, which tells me they know it's defective. Lots of great products on Temu but one bad experience and I've deleted my account. Some products are complete garbage and selling cheaper for a reason. Update: Temu has answered my review with another standard bot answer that is exactly the same answer as their previous one. The problem is, it leads back to ' unfortunately we can't refund your purchase'. It's all bs.",1,16/04/2023

I have tried to establish what is happening the automated robot does not answer with the information required and endlessly goes around in circles. Not am easy return that I was hoping for.

No update since on items being processed and refund agreed. Still no update showing.",1,17/04/2023

Temu offer excellent value on all items from clothing to household items. Sometimes the size isnt quite right or the quality may be not what you expect. However 9 times out of 10 everything is good and on the occasion something isnt right they offer an excellent and efficient refund service. I love Temu and shop with confidence as they always put things right immediately!,4,17/04/2023
Around 6 months ago I bought an Animal Repeller for use in our vegi garden. I thought it might be a simple rechargeable battery problem but the solar cell was working and the battery was able to recharge and hold a charge. The problem was within the system - un repairable.

"I recently started purchasing from Temu.  As for the customer services are concerned, they appear to be good so far.  A great difference to Ali Baba, which is terrible.  However, where the merchandise is concerned, the quality has no difference to Ali Baba merchandise.IMHO, Amazon appears to be the best out of the three.  I know as I have been buying for over 10 years from Amazon.  e-Bay used to be the best, but no more.  It is a platform for the 'Middle Man' and not for individuals selling used or new merchandise.If Temu is attempting to capture some of the Amazon customers, they need to screen the dealers of 'Chinese Junk' on their site.  The products have been consistently inferior to the photo listings.  I will never purchase clothing on this site as what looks so pretty on the listings are no better than wrapping paper when they arrive.",2,17/04/2023
"Temu's clothing is not anywhere close to American sizing options. Clothes run three or four sizes too small, and there are no options whatever for people who are larger with any measurement greater than 40"". If the company would align its sizing with American or even European sizing charts it would be possible to order clothes from them, but at present buyer beware.",3,17/04/2023

"I love temu but ,  I have recieved many free items . However the Ca 0$ items and the win 4 freebees is rediculous,  you can only win if you can find new temu members also takes forever playing fishland and farmland after many hours of playing its difficult to get more members to join and after having been with temu for quite awhile I'm unable to find new users ? Therefore it's a waste of time and effort .It is basically impossible and believe me ive tried a few times ,  I've spoke to many who are in agreement , Otherwise I'm very happy with Temu and with the free gifts I have received and my purchases . Thank you !",5,17/04/2023

If there was a zero I would put it in.  The delivery company has lied four times telling me my package would be delivered. I changed my schedule and waited in vain every time. Then Temu tells me it takes up to a month to process and refund or I can have a credit. Why would I want a credit when they are not capable of delivering,1,18/04/2023
"I needed to return two items.  After spending 40 minutes on their website trying to accomplish this in many ways,  I finally had to spend 10 minutes trying to find a phone number for their customer service.   The person spoken to was completely clueless as to how this could be accomplished.  After trying to get help for another 15 minutes, I asked to speak to a supervisor, and of course a supervisor wasn't available.   Temu probably wonders why they are losing all their business to Amazon.  It takes one minute to get a return label from Amazon.  I will never, ever use Temu again!",1,18/04/2023
"Do not trust TEMU at all. All those statements they make on their website do not coincide with reality.

ALL THEY ARE IS JUST ANOTHER CONMEN WEBSITE.Do not buy ANYTHING FROM TEMU, BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN ITEMS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The quality of the clothing and bedcovers is really poor.Do not waste your money on them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I bought some glass jars from them that weren't cheap at all. You're better off buying them in IKEA.I also bought some black soup bowls because I thought they would be porcelain turns out they're just plastic.I also bought some solar light fittings because on the photograph they looked like a decent size, that in reality were 10 cm by 5 cm.

"Acknowledgement: Since writing this review, I have finally managed to contact a reasonable human being who, without hesitation, offered a full refund and brought the dispute to a satisfactory conclusion, albeit 3 months after the initial sale.I bought two pairs of gym shorts (see below). Both pairs were well-made, in durable colour-fast polyester, double stitched with a broad waistband and useful drawstrings with plastic ends. No problem at all with the manufacture of the products. But I ordered M, for a 32-inch waist and both pairs were 36-inch+ waists and wide legs (I measured). The probable reason is that, as the label inside indicates the size is: UK L (for large); USA M. I was sent large instead of medium. I should have ordered S -- but how was I to know? I gave both pairs away to a beefier friend! 2-piece Set, Stretch Breathable Lightweight Men's Drawstring Sports Shorts With Pocket Design, Suitable For Summer Gym Training @ ??16.99.@Temu's reply was: ""We are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.

"Temu are getting worse and worse. They throw everything in a thin plastic bag and ship it like that hoping nothing gets damaged.

"what has destroyed humanity is dishonesty, manipulating using fake procedures to get into customers mind. Just tell you that the nature will prevail and get dishonest people destroyed. Chinese companies in particular Temu uses misleading techniques to attract customers. They advertise the cheapest when you click on that, then that item is not available but instead a much more expensive is available. You buy an item lets say ??10 the next week same item will go 25 percent up. I do not like them to manipulate people who are not aware of their dishonest selling techniques",1,19/04/2023

I received 1 faulty thing, contacted the shop I got from, the asked for a few pics. I happily sent them, my replacement was posted same day,  can't complain about that. But that farmland game is ridiculous and painful. Totally made in Chinese over lord fashion. Unless you commit your whole life to it and pester everyone you know with invites it's nearly impossible.

"I ordered a mattress topper from one of the few companies that?€?s on temus site called koladream. It?€?s supposedly a local warehouse meaning it wouldn?€?t take long to get here. Well today it was supposed to show up or they were supposed to give me the $5 credit. Amazon shipping I guess is handling some of the shipments. Who really knows anymore? I?€?ve contacted my local post office, the person that?€?s supposedly koladream (they wouldn?€?t respond back) and temu to ask where my update for my package was since it was four days and it wasn?€?t saying anything. Temu kept telling me just to wait (even though I told them I messaged koladream and they didn?€?t respond to me) and I also told temu that Amazon supposedly said it wasn?€?t even koladream who sent the package. So I have no idea what?€?s going on. All I know is one of their reviews says they didn?€?t even receive their package either. I had to ask temu repeatedly for a refund. The first customer service member was very rude but finally they got me someone on there that was much better.",1,19/04/2023

Was great for a while but then told me that there was an anomaly with my account and I could no longer purchase. They refused to tell me what it was or answer any questions.

I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to learn from this experience to better serve you in the future.

Well, my parcels have arrived today. Some items have gone straight in the bin as they?€?re unfit for purpose. I cannot be hassled with the return process. I?€?ve had to put the shoes outside as my eyes are stinging with the chemical fumes coming off them. I?€?ve put a duvet set and T-shirts straight into the washing machine to get rid of the toxic fumes coming off them too. A lunch bag is a waste of time?€?the zip part doesn?€?t close the bag completely?€?what?€?s the point ? Ice lolly silicone mould straight in the bin as it leaked as soon as put some juice in it and I?€?ve had to clean a right mess up. Car cleaning cloth is a quarter of the size pictured in the advert. The cardigans are knitted with an awful cheap ?€?wool?€? definitely not wool but some sort of horrible synthetic stuff. T-shirts are made from horrible cheap fabric and not worth more than ??3 each . The only good thing is that the sizes are true ?€?the shoes fit well too. I may buy more stuff if I can get them at a cheap price as I guess they?€?re useful for holidays when you get stuff covered in sunscreen so chuck them but it?€?s very wasteful and that?€?s a lot going to landfill. I will certainly not be falling for their endless gimmicks trying to get you to spend for coupons again.

But in the last few months there's a lot to be said about their processing time.  I don't know if it's because of my reviews but the processing times for my orders of late are shockingly long. I'm always online chatting to them about this issue. I ordered some thing from Shein and I received them within 2 weeks. I can't understand why temu can't do similar. Many say they get their orders from temu in about 2 weeks or so. Maybe it is just my orders that get delayed because of my frequent queries on their chat line. All I know is that the delivery time from when you order before receiving delivery is starting to make me wonder if it's worth the hassle. A pity as they have many interesting items.",3,21/04/2023

Probably because of the marketing emails I have bought a lot from Temu. Some reasonable quality some not at low prices. Some of the many marketing emails offer credit back which seems impossible to apply . Querying this with Temu seems impossible. I must break the Temu habit.Temu s response is to contact them on live chat  which not on the homepage of their application. I eventually find by searching chat. It is not a good process.

I always receive confirmations for my orders, tracking info and delivery notices ... had a few credits when orders didn't arrive on time.  I receive the items through Canada Post and they are very good at delivering my orders.

"My complaint concerns the delivery service TEMU uses; HAILIFY.  A package was supposed to have been delivered by ""Hailify"" on 6-1-2024. Despite the tracking showing ""out for delivery"" the package never arrived. When the package still had not arrived on 6-3, I called ""Hailify""  was told that all of the driver's packages had been stolen after the driver was contacted while I was on the phone. The driver never called his employer about the theft. It was  only after I called did ""Hailify"" learn about the issue. Nor was TEMU ever contacted about the alleged theft. There are other delivery issues I've had with this company which would take too long to write about.     All I can say is that ""HAILIFY"" is going to cause TEMU to lose a lot of customers, including me. Just Google ""Reddit"" as proof  and read some of the reviews of ""Hailify"" to see what I am talking about.",3,22/04/2023

"I have been shopping on Temu for a year now.  I?€?ve bought many many items all very different.  Most are very cheaply made but for the price are exceptional value.  I can track all orders from purchase to delivery and most are delivered within 3 weeks, but always within stated delivery times.  I get maybe 3 emails for every order too.  Recently, I purchased a back pack for work.  Heavy duty work as I always carry a lap top and paperwork.  Back Pack is good quality, exactly as advertised and excellent value at ??11!",4,23/04/2023
"Is Temu a trusted company? I went to their website 2 days ago to buy a few items and moat of the items have reduced price if you buy it today. I bought a few items but the ""today"" price wasn't honored. Today, I received ???? discount on 1st item, only to find out it wasn't true. I tried to go back even though I never confirmed payment, money was deducted from my account.",1,23/04/2023
"Temu is reliable in the sense that what you order will be delivered. However the quality is totally a hit an miss. I ordered a dozen different items, of which 2 were good and 10 were cheap garbage that broke almost instantly. What happens is that products look great in pictures and when you receive it you'll be totally disillusioned as to what you've just bought. All products I bought had nothing but 5 star reviews but the items often broke after just one or two uses. They make shopping very entertaining and gamified, like a casino or something like that. This adds to the excitement of shopping and makes it an exciting easter egg hunt, but it's not for your benefit.Save the planet, and save your money, and buy the product from a local seller who you trust.",2,23/04/2023
"They promised to collect the parcel in 2 days, that was last week Monday if Iam not mistaken, and I said to myself let me give them a chance, but to my disappointment Iam still here sitting and waiting on them. I am going to leave an alternative number 0817488748.",2,23/04/2023

Hello temu well what can i say despite all the bad reviews Ive ordered a few times and had no problems i love everything i ordered the only thing i would complain about is the amount of messages emails that you get after ordering that puts you off ordering from them really not the products or delivery the emails and txt messages after.,5,23/04/2023
"Clothing aside, I have had good luck ordering kitchen items and office supplies from Temu. I would avoid the clothing, as the sizes are wonky & the quality of the fabric is poor. But, their return policy is exceptional for a Chinese company. They do not charge shipping for return. They ship faster than expected & return your money promptly.  Some other companies do not clearly state their return policy & charge exorbitant prices for returns. Always check trustpilot before placing orders at companies you are not familiar with.",4,24/04/2023

"I am happy with most of my orders. However, as a senior age 83 it is very important to me that Temu lets me know what the blouse/dress I purchase is cotton mix etc. I received what appeared to be a beautiful blouse. It was as it I was wearing saran wrap. It was awful b/c it doesn't breath. I don't at my age know how to send back b/c I no longer drive. This was last summer. Please please right away mention what type of material your clothing comes in. Just saying. Other than that, I am able to find things on Temu to make my life easier! :)",4,24/04/2023

I've been with temu years and it's my favourite shop, why pay more. If you don't like your product return it. I'm surprised at how low reviews it gets.

They believed it has been missing somewhere and they refunded me money but it?€?s wrong that they never contacted or updated me about the situation! I had to find out what happened. Their policy says that if there?€?s no update on the item for 15 days straight the item will be delivered free of charge, there was NO update for longer than 15 days and they quickly proceeded to refund me money! I?€?ve never wanted the money i wanted the pack package  . Its so wrong on many levels and they work against their policy! I am so disappointed and i am gonna take it further and complain .

"When an advert comes up which is temu you can't just click on and look at the advert and get a price. Instead it makes you download the app which I did yesterday. Since then I have been bombarded with message after message. Additional information I've just added a day later. Just had an email from trust pilot regarding my review for temu so they can respond or verify my experience. It's asking my name, phone number, email and reference number. There's no reference number as I didn't buy any thing nor need to to get all the messages from them. They have my email as all the messages were via email and not a chance are they getting my phone number to do the same using that.

I am very disappointed with my first order.I ordered gifts but the boxes inside were crushed so can?€?t now give as a gift so a total waste of money. Many items are cheaper on Amazon.I wouldn?€?t recommend and won?€?t be shopping with Temu again. Very dissatisfied The sizes are also way out. Ordered 10s and they were more like 16/18,1,25/04/2023

I ordered two pairs of shoes in size 42, I received 44, I returned the order and ordered size 42 again, my order arrived in 3 weeks, and bingo they sent me two pairs of shoes in size 44 again. I have never met a worse company.I spent a lot of time and nerves and what I received twice was not what I ordered and the rest of the orders did not arrive at all, keep losing customers...",1,26/04/2023

"I regularly use Temu. I can honestly say that I am happy with the service. I have found that the quality of the clothing is very good and after a few trial and errors have found a size that fits my body shape.As always wash colours separately as like with any clothing the dye can run.I bought a handbag and experienced in the rain that it wasn't waterproof (in saying that it was an extremely bad downpour and I don't think many handbags would have been adequate to be honest - you get what you pay for).A backpack that I ordered was advertised as waterproof but it wasn't, I now use it to carry clothes for weekend visits.Always check your sizing when buying hand creams as 10g is no size at all and you will be disappointed if you are expecting a UK sized product (again my fault).The refund process is easy, upload a few photos and the job is done. You will either get a return label or a credit to your temu account (I can see why some would prefer the money back onto the payment card. I just use the temu credit on my next order as it instantly goes onto your account). Sometimes you will get a refund (may take ??1 off original price) and have the added bonus of being able to keep the item. When this happens as they suggest I donate it to someone that the clothing will fit.Here's the downside - there are constant offers of gift boxes and discounts. These usually pop up once you've placed an order. You can add items to your orders but sometimes the perks are for items that you've just ordered and you have to go through the faff of removing the item then do one click add to order which doesn't use temu credit.Be careful when selecting colour options as something that is red will be priced differently than something that is black (i still cant get my head around this).Lastly if you are as they say a valued customer, why should you have to place an over to claim ??30 as a valued customer. If Temu value your custom that much they would apply the discount to your account as temu credit so that you could use it on your next shop. Like I have said there is more good than bad and the webchat is really good. I have also found the price reduction button, which is a fab idea, so I always use this, it might only be 2p here or 50p there but it instantly gets applied to your account as temu credit and gets used when I next place an order.",4,26/04/2023
"Cheap as chips clothing,  but overall good quality ???",5,26/04/2023
"To Moldova the parcel came quick, but because Temu is partnering with Fancurier, Romanian company that is new on the Moldavian market and has only one office and couple of vans, my parcel was kept at their warehouse more then 2 weeks.

"We are encouraged to leave a glowing review quite quickly however, the longer my items are used, the more issues I encounter.Bought a lovely pleather overnight bag, looked stunning but the handle broke on the 3rd use leaving sharp metal exposed.The little fashion clutch fasteners have become unglued from the bag again with sharp metal claws exposed.A wig described as human hair smelled awful and was not human hair.",3,27/04/2023

When I uploaded a screenshot of my yodel app confirming my specific delivery instructions and they dont listen,  how's that my fault. I also did not know these two parcels were out for delivery.

"I thought I would order  for the first time to see for myself what the quality of products are. My order arrived after 10 days of ordering. A month later I still don?€?t have it because Buffalo Logistics say I owe them money for Duty. I have paid duty 3 weeks ago. I uploaded proof of payment numerous times. I have called, emailed and contacted them via Whats app. All contact replies are automated and I get the same message. Send proof of payment. I will not buy from Temu again until they get another logistics company. Buffalo is useless. I guess I can kiss my purchase goodbye.",1,27/04/2023
"I ordered few items. I received 2 ripped off shipping bags and 2 items (PO-191-21051151626871740 & PO-191-07994374139511740)contained only the broken boxes with no items in them. I repeatedly contained TEMU by chatt, email and cll back. I sent them pictures and explained that using trash bag for shipping is not correct. They can easily get ripped off during transportation and items fall off. I explained that I will share this so others know your poor practice. Anyway I have paid about 1000kr for 2 empty boxes.They says the packages were in good conditions when they left warehouse and they take no responsibility for the condition of packages when customers receive them.Please help me.

"Yet again ""offers"" fail to be genuine (and no I don't want to discuss further with Temu thanks). Wanted to re-order something I'd recently had delivered and found useful. Straight away (I should have known better) was offered ??90 in return for collecting coins online which after messing around a bit showed I needed to spend a certain amount to get the total required for ??90. However whilst putting things into my trolley and searching for extra things to reach the required coin total, everything disappeared and I couldn't find my ongoing order so I instead started again and ordered what I originally wanted plus extra bits and pieces to get a free collection delivery.Save yourself hassle and ignore the ""offers"" and misleading free delivery, just order what you want and be aware it needs to come to ??15+.See the Temu answer below (obviously AI generated as ignores my request not to bother me further). It's about time the company owners realised that UK buyers really aren't interested in these kind of marketing stunts and most find them tacky and off-putting. Why and how would a commercial company offer a customer occasionally spending ??15-??20 a free ??90, it makes no sense whatsoever. Think about it before wasting your time.",1,27/04/2023
I was reading through reviews of a product and almost every review had the same phrase including lack of capitalization and typos. Most of them said ?€?hope it works for me?€? sometimes twice or ?€?i smells pretty good?€?. There were other phrases duplicated the exact same way in other reviews. When you go on Amazon the reviews are not worded EXACTLY the same way.,2,27/04/2023

"I placed an order Mon, 20th May and paid an extra ??9 for an accelerated delivery of max 8 days.  Unfortunately my schedule changed which meant I would no longer be available to receive my delivery.I had a live chat conversation with customer services on Tues 28th May, who recommended I contact my courier but his profile doesn't include his contact details. Customer Services then recommended I contact Evri/Hermes which I did. They promised a response within 24hs which should have been by the following day. I've still not heard anything. This would have been easily resolved if the courier had his contact details on his profile, otherwise what's the point of having his name and picture???My order is now being returned, I hope I won't be charged for this?

"This company does not assume responsibility for the delivery of orders. If the order was not delivered to you once, you have the right to ask them to send you the same order again. And if this second order is not delivered to you. They do not I recognize your objection.For example, I found it written on their website that my order was left in the mailbox, at least I waited all day at home for this order. And in this box only a few small letters fit. And my order was a vest. And when I contested this delivery, they told me that the post office had already delivered my order somewhere, and I have to look better to maybe find it.Or it's probably somewhere near the neighbors, or on the street somewhere.I still have a credit of 24 euros from these scamers on their website and I don't know what to do, because I know that whatever I order from them, the chance is 50/50 that the order will reach me.And to return that money back to my bank card is not possible.At first I trusted them, but after the answer they gave me to my complaint, I understood that they are scammers........................................You do your job properly. But you use the Dutch or Belgian post, but this post does not assume any responsibility, the people who work for them with the delivery of postal parcels still do not assume any responsibility. They can leave the postal parcels on the street in front of the door. Or they can not leave them at all and write in their reports that they have already handed over the parcels. This is something normal in some European countries.For example, for the post office in the Netherlands or Belgium, this is something usual. Those who work at these posts have no responsibility, and there is no authority to check how they do their work. That's why it happens.And when you go to the post office to ask what's going on, they tell you that they don't have enough staff and because of this they can't do anything.I know dozens of cases about this.They simply don't care.What's the use of you doing your job properly if your work is boycotted and sabotaged by these ba.st.ards.",1,28/04/2023

"0 rating.A wall bracket damaged my wall when it fell down. Temu reimbursed me ??2.56 but refused to acknowledge compensation on the wall.Secondly,  wanted to return all items as got sooo fed up with the wall bracket issue but Temu refused to acknowledge the damage on the wall and repeated that a refund on the wall bracket has been given ( Finally found an agent who I think understood) and I was asked to go buy a bag to return all the other items on the same order. I was informed that the  cost of the bag will be reimbursed and agent will email the QR code for returns but that agent forgot to press the refund button. I patientently waited for the email but it never came. So I called and Temu said that it's now just over 90 days so no refund will be processed. Its NOT MY FAULT if the agent forgot to process the refund. Asked to speak to a manager, 2 agents refused.  On my 3rd attempt an agent agreed that a manager will call/email within 24 hours but no calls backs. Called again  and was promised another 24 hours and nothing. The agents have a script to read but are not allowed to use common sense and move the matter further. There is no proper complaints section and a further appeal's process. Absolute time and money wasted when its not my fault. Please can I have my full refund now.Again Temu has just ignored my issue if returns stating its over 90 days when it isn't.  Please call me to discuss. Temu's process not to understand customers is now really getting me angry.

"Temu promised me 20% off my purchase to be used WHEN I CHOOSE UP UNTIL JUNE 3, 2024 and issued this because of the terrible customer service they gave me before.

I think that?€?s pretty sneaky when I didn?€?t press the button to use it yet and wanted to use it today and it was gone , gobbled up with a purchase I made yesterday! The worst part is this was all WITHOUT MY PERMISSION! And when I called them out on the error they said they would NOT fix it. They are very sneaky and their promotions smell of SCAM and taking advantage of unsuspecting people whenever they can. Be very careful Canadians, as we seem to be their target despite hearing about a lawsuit in the USA because they are selling off customers credit information to other parties for profit.

The quality is what I expect for the price but for our purposes its ideal as as long as it looks okay, it doesn't matter if the quality isn't there.

The trousers are fantastic, fit perfectly and are a lovely, light fabric for summer.  The top is well made but just a bit snug on the waist. So I will return the top.  I've ordered more trousers and shorts today, so fingers crossed.  Cost of my first order for pair of trousers and the top was ??15. I reckon on the High Street they would have been ??30.

They said they couldn't post the review as the item was no longer stocked, but going to the search option on the first page alone it brings up at least 7 different options to buy the item. Obviously this is how they keep just good reviews and weed out the bad ones. Puts me off ever buying from them again. Edit: I have messaged you and complained about what you have done regarding the review.  I did the complaint before putting the review up.",1,29/04/2023
"Temu is great, i buys many things there, but i recommend  you  to order things depends with price, high price high quality.",4,29/04/2023
"I have used Temu regularly for the last six months. An item I want, seen advertised on Facebook that I have put into Amazon basket is then compared pricewise with Temu.One item that I bought on Facebook for ??18, Temu were selling it for under ??3 and it was exactly the same item when it arrived! The ??18 item from the states was broken in transit and refunded. My only complaint is the bombardment if emails and pressure selling. Coupons Dont work and are a waste of time.",4,30/04/2023
Even 1 out of 5 is high for temu! I ordered items and was delivered through royalmail. I didnt recieve anything but tracking showed a picture of package left outside of house. I live on the main road so i called royalmail and they said maybe the driver put it and then took it back as must have thought its not safe. I was told to wait few days which i did and reported this to temu aswell. They said its delivered we cant do anything about this. Then after few days as i didnt receive it i called royalmail and they put this on for investigation. Now yesterday when i called royalmail they said we still cant find the items and therefore the supplier will need to raise a claim and give you money back and that they have a contract with them in whoch legally they need to claim from us and give you and that its not them that will be out of pocket. I raised a ticket with temu again for this providing new reference number by which they can check with royalmail. However no one seems to check with this reference number and keeps saying its delivered without check with new reference where i took this further. Just spoke to live and its rubbish as cant get through due to being a computer. I have asked many times to put me on a call but they say they are too busy so cant put me though even though im happy to wait. Just a terrible company as their after sale is rubbish.,1,30/04/2023
"The ceiling clock that I received was found to have a time display fault with continuous flashing of the time display. Using the TEMU App return-refund button and supplying photos of fault as requested I made a refund claim. Shortly thereafter I checked the app and found a postage return prepaid label for the return of the item. The item was returned in the original carton. I received a credit refund the following day on the TEMU appThat I used with my next purchase The credit is not to your payment source Philip Coonan, Ireland",4,30/04/2023
"Bought a jacket and shorts for partner , parcel arrived 3 days early, unfortunately no jacket!

"Just received my first order from Temu. I placed a fairly small order to see what the quality was like, planning bigger orders if satisfactory. Really pleased with the clothes I received. Some are better than others of course, but for the insanely inexpensive price, I cannot complain. Delivery time was just over a week (including a bank holiday) and I was emailed every step of the way.Really pleased with Temu. Have already placed a second order.",5,01/05/2023
"Most of the products are really good and the prices are great, the only real problem I have is that the delivery time seems to be longer, I'm not sure if it's Temu's fault or the fault of the couriers Evri, I also order from another well known site and I've made an order on both sites, I'm still waiting for the Temu order.",4,01/05/2023
Please remove my review. I mistook a bad experience with Ali Express with Temu. My apologies,3,01/05/2023
"My parcel was delivered to a closed shop and left outside where it could be stolen. Since the seller chose the courier, it's their responsibility to sort this out.",1,01/05/2023
Some great is items some not great but easy to return for refund always worth a look,5,02/05/2023
"While Temu prices are very low I don't trust their descriptions of products or reviews.  Reviews appear only to be the absolute perfect reviews and never anything negative.  Recently I purchased 6"" door hinges for an outside project.  They were light duty at best. though described as heavy-duty.  Temu quickly refunded my but I would like to see all the customer reviews not just those that are excellent.",3,02/05/2023
"I've had many orders from Temu and I've no complaints at all. Most of the items I've ordered have been great value and much cheaper than stores here.  They do take a bit longer for delivery, but they are well packaged and delivered intact. So I'll carry on ordering from them.",5,02/05/2023

If I can?€?t even get my first order, why would I want to order more that I won?€?t get? Not happy with this experience at all. I?€?ll be cancelling my membership and never ordering from them again. WAY worse than Amazon, and I?€?m not very happy with them lately, as their service has also plummeted. I guess that?€?s what happens when profits are prioritized over your customers.",1,02/05/2023
"I have bought so many items Temu And I have to say, I?€?ve been pleased with basically Most of my orders one or two things have been sent back, but all in all I have found the return process and the purchasing and delivering bang on if anything I think I?€?m addicted to it . People Have commented On clothing that I have bought from Temu and the items have all washed up and ironed well no complaints from me",5,02/05/2023
"Nothing to do with website description,  absolutely disappointed,  I'll never waste my money with Temu.",1,02/05/2023
"not all items are well, and their reviews looks strange, it is difficult to believe them sometimes. Refund/return works very well though. But percentage of defective items is higher, than I'd expected on better mark :)Anyway, it is very well as recieving purchases, all items collected in one parcel, what is very handy. And there are a lot of items that is impossible to find in other places, and the prices is very juicy.",3,02/05/2023
"Absolutely love shopping on Temu!I have ordered stuff several times on Temu, and the experience was great each time. Delivery was always within the specified time so I have never gotten the ??4 late delivery refund.A couple of times I tried to return items, and they told me to keep the item and they'll give me the refund anyway. Mostly the items were of good quality, occasionally rubbish and occasionally exceptional- its always a gamble but on the whole i've been very happy and will continue shopping with Temu!And the endless variety always makes shopping on Temu fun!",5,02/05/2023
"It's been a week already that I've tired to return my order. Temu keeps sending me the same infuriating copy-paste replies that don't answer my questions 4th time in a row now. The return is, according to the system, to be done through DB Schenke, which according to their page has the closest drop off point dozens of kms away and yet Temu keeps claiming I can return door to door, which is not an option in the system.",1,02/05/2023
"Over 4 weeks of travel for 1 item???? I ordered 25 items, 2 have arrived, 22 STILL with courier since Saturday 25th??? And 1 coming by land???? The last one will take over 4 weeks of travel, what a joke. Also I put a review in of 2 items damaged on arrival and got nothing ?? No Reply??? This company may be cheaper but is it really worth it??? To many order numbers to give. You no who I am and what I have ordered. Well 2 items were damaged and got nothing back for the sellers???",1,02/05/2023
I like temu itself but that may want to look into some of the courier companies they use The things I get are great just the couriers,4,02/05/2023

My Temu experience. Non arrival of ordered and paid for goods.Bad sizing.,1,02/05/2023
"I?€?ve ordered loads from Temu and generally stuff is a bit cheap but then some things are amazing. However, this time somethings was broken - but a quick pic and they refunded. Worse though, one part of the order was sent separately and it was not delivered to my address. They sent a picture as proof of delivery and despite telling them that was not my house nor my neighbours they still refuse to do anything. So if it turns up then great, but if your package gets stolen or delivered to the wrong address you will be out of pocket as they will do nothing but tell you it has been delivered. I don?€?t trust them any longer. Beware.",1,02/05/2023
bad quality goods,1,02/05/2023
Truly unserious company. One thing is the google translate in all things. But promises of refund are not kept and shipping company not contacted as promised. Tired. And DONE,1,03/05/2023

"Well I'm impressed. Delivered on time, kept informed all the way no problems.",5,03/05/2023
"I see there are those that are whining about Temu. I guess they have seen a huge drop in their profits. Temu sells many items that are on Amazon, Ebay etc for far less. Even shops like B&Q Argos sell exactly the same items BUT with a huge markup. They even use the same information and images. If they purchased those items from elsewhere I might understand BUT they bulk purchase them from China, then hike the price up massively which is a rip off and greed. I have purchased from Temu AlieExpress and Shein without any problems whatsoever. I will continue to order from TEMU as long as the prices are more reasonable than the ripoff prices here.I have ordered hundreds of items without any problem whatsoever.",5,03/05/2023
Never AGAIN ! The item I order was to be delivery yesterday  . Nothing today as well . I will NOT order anything again .,1,03/05/2023
thank you quick response and problem  resolved offered a full refund,5,03/05/2023
"A couple of years ago I looked at products on temu. Now my email is stuffed with their product junk ads. Google/Gmail will not stop them even though I've requested so dozens of times. Don't open any temu garbage or you will be inundated if you do. (Update 2 days later) So now I'm directed to open my Gmail by temu. Click on this, open that, change this, change that, etc. Why is it my responsibility to jump through hoops to solve a problem that I didn't initiate. I've deleted dozens and dozens of them and made formal requests to stop through their portals. No resolution. I pay big money for my phone and services. It is not a device for unsolicited junk spam ads and emails. I'm totally capable if finding things of interest without junk prompts from temu or any other manufacturer or service. It's like eating a good meal, but I don't need hundreds more in a span of a few days. They just don't get it. Even now I'm using my time to enter this information, my time!",1,03/05/2023
Someone got hold of my mobile phone only for  few hours but in that time they went on to my temu app and done some shopping.  They made purchases by using stored details which temu keeps.  They didn't have my debit card. They didn't have the 16 digit card number or the security code.  Temu stores all the details needed and anyone can click on to it and spend all the money in your bank account.  They even changed the delivery address and no security checks was done by temu.  Then when I got my phone back.  I noticed money had gone missing from my account and saw the pending purchases in my account.  I immediately went on to temu and cancelled all the purchases then I spoke to the temu agent about getting my money refunded but at first temu refused to refund it and kept it as credit.  This meant the money I lost through theft  they was happy to keep it and wouldn't just give it back.  I then had to kick up a fuss so temu decided to refund my stolen money but only after 30 days.  I presume so they could earn interest from it nd when you consider they're a global company and similar things must happen to millions of thier customers it could earn temu  a lot of money.  I have now deleted the temu app.  Never again will I purchase anything from them.  I'm disgusted by them.  I feel as if temu also stolen my money but temu was so polite about it whilst they did it. Smiling assassins they are.,1,03/05/2023
Delivered goods i hadn't ordered. Very unhelpful in trying to get my money refunded.,1,03/05/2023
"I used to order from this company frequently because their prices are very reasonable. However, I noticed a significant issue with their billing practices. The total cost of my orders always ends up being about $20 more than the listed prices. They claim that shipping is free, but this isn't true since the total amount is inflated. If you add up the cost of your purchases on your own, you'll see that the final amount doesn't match. This hidden padding makes it feel like I'm being overcharged under the guise of free shipping.  Additionally, though jewelry is very inexpensive it breaks easily sometimes as you are removing it from the wrapping. They also used to provide one free item returned for free but you did not have to return it, which was ok, even though I sometimes had more than one thing that should have been returned.  Now they require a return of the item to them directly.  Since I was planning to return one item, I decided to return all but two things.  Instead. They then offered me to keep everything in exchange for less than $20.   I accepted after reading many reviews about all the difficulties others encountered with returns on this site. I decided not to chance it and accepted the less than $20.    Be extremely careful as there is plenty chicanery with this company. Angela",1,03/05/2023
"I've been shopping/buying stuff on Temu for years and always have the same problem, *(First) I can't contact Temu customer service. *(Second) I bought stuff by mistake it took me 3 seconds when I realised that was purchase the item by mistake!! I cancelled the order straight away and asked for a refund, it takes 18-20 days to get your money back for 3 seconds mistake purchase.*(3rd) Temu gives you an incorrect description or false information to buy stuff in return you can get coupons but when you buy stuff and spend money you will never get coupons and forced me to spend more and more money,  when you are want to cancel it, it takes 18 to 20 days to get a refund. Temu was OK before but now getting worse and scamming people",1,03/05/2023
Cheap rubbish,1,04/05/2023
"Honestly, honestly, this is one of the worst companies I?€?ve ever shopped with. They?€?re clothing first off. I?€?ve ordered a few things off of there went through my mom and my dad and stuff and usually the sizes are not correct. The fabric is freaking thin as hell and it pretty much disintegrates within one wash the colours are never what they?€?re supposed to be. Don?€?t pay for this site. Trust me it?€?s not worth it Go to SHEIN Boot most of the customer service people are id$&@. They don?€?t know what they?€?re talking about and they?€?re reading off of a freaking sheet in front of them. Half of them are sitting at home eating popcorn with their mommy at 45 yrs old!",1,04/05/2023
"This is not a review of Temu products or delivery, I am entirely satisfied with both BUT I do not like, nor think it professional, to be inundated with 'offers' and promotions that appear to only be backdoor inducements into placing further orders. I have unsubscribed from communications, yet when I go to the site to check on my most recent order delivery I still get 'wheel of fortune' type offers with the 'prizes' not being straight forward vouchers and nothing ever appearing in my Offers folder.This sort of thing might appeal to some but frankly I find it a put off.",1,04/05/2023

After hearing mixed reviews of this site I was very sceptical..but I must say I am very happy with it and my purchases.Delivery was a little late and they credited my  ??4 as specified when placing order if delivery was a day late.I am very happy with all I have ordered and will continue using this app ????,5,04/05/2023
I Love Temu! All my orders are always on time! The quality for such a small price is just perfect for me! Whatever I am sending back I always get a full refund! Very happy with the procedures! I think one of the best online shopping systems out there!,5,04/05/2023
Having a start that says I have free post. I select my goods and go to pay for my purchases and had to have to buy $A40 worth before free post.Maybe this should be known at the start not when you are ready to buy.I cancelled the goods.,1,04/05/2023
"Excellent products. Amazingly cheap. I am disgusted with the greedy people who expect free shipping for a small item or two. I have ordered hundreds of dollars worth of products from this wonderful company and have never had a problem. People would never get these things for this price in Australia. I have had on time deliveries, products exactly as described and am delighted with all my purchases as is my family and friends. Thank you Temu.",5,04/05/2023
Good cheap Quality things. Eventually it adds up to hundreds at a time to receive the promised rewards then the Games! Seriously don't bother they take months and months to win free things. Not only does it take months you constantly have to share for the games like fish farm etc so other people can be roped into it.,3,04/05/2023
"This company takes money from you and does not refund, customer service consists of a clueless 'chat bot' with no contact with reasonable human to solve issues.If you use this company don't expect any customer service or to get your money back The response from temu below is typical of what I have experienced, an automatically generated response, they ignored my requests for the return of payment and they just give standard robotic reply directing back to the website. So if you do not want to lose money don't use temu",1,04/05/2023
"I ordered two items- one is a small silver ring. The packaging, a thin plastic envelope, arrived damaged. The ring was missing. The top corner seemed like it got stuck and forcibly pulled causing a large hole big enough for smaller items to fall out. An adult hand can fit in the hole if anyone wants to steal something inside. I made several attempts to get a refund but was always refused saying their warehouse confirmed item was packed. It was obviously damaged and and lost in transit. I sent pictures showing the damage and original tracking label. They repeatedly denied me a refund saying item was confirmed to have been shipped. Not sure if they are playing dumb or what, but they don?€?t consider the fact that the package was damaged and item was lost in transit. It doesn?€?t cost much money but the unfair business practice is something FTC should investigate. At the moment, they still refused to refund me.UPDATE 05/29/24Temu finally refunded me for the lost item. But their email insinuates I am dishonest bcause they confirmed again item was shipped by the warehouse. I told them several times I believe it was shipped but they never acknowledged the fact that in online business where items go thru different handlers during transit, it can be damaged or lost . And I have photo evidence of the damaged package. They think this is impossible to happen in an online business like theirs. Ridiculous!!!",1,04/05/2023
Been using Temu for quite a while now a lot cheaper than eBay everything I have ordered has been shipped quickly and is very good quality so ????????up for me,5,04/05/2023

"I can only say good things about Temu! The variety offered is mind boggling and most prices a real bargain. When something seem expensive I check the same item on Amazon and decide. If something is damaged they are the fastest to refund, within seconds!!!I have been shopping with them for about a year and will continue to do so, until they continue to be so efficient.",4,04/05/2023
"My first, my LAST purchase from this shower, paid with pay pal for item, when item arrived it was not what advert had shown, disputed and wanted to return item, temu dragged returns beyond time limit, I am ??25 in loss.SHOP elsewhere for larger items, they may be ok for selling minor trinklets it?€?s up to you",1,04/05/2023
"I honestly do not know how this company gets bad reviews, I have been using them for over a year and have not had one failed delivery or any problems relating payments/returns. I have bought well over ??300 worth of items I. This time and nearly all have been better than expected. Most o the cloths are good quality and defo worth the money, yes the odd item has not lived up to the picture but a no quibble FREE return policy is more than you can ask for, the only gripe I have is the offers they keep giving me reducing items in my basket!!! cost me a fortune as I keep buying stuff I don?€?t need. Yes they may take 10 days to arrive but it is China! Cannot recommend these enough, I reckon the bad reviews are from government employees!! Great company.",5,04/05/2023

Hard to return , not like Amazon.ca because I don't know how to upload my return item into their page.I delete the Temu website, because everything is not worth it but it comes back, evertime I open my computer, haunted me like a ghost. Be ware of this company",1,04/05/2023
"I ordered two items, and the wrong items arrived. I have spent hours trying to get them returned. I found an email address but it bounced back.

"OK, so at 1.38pm today I received a notification saying  my parcel had been delivered, no it hadn't so when I checked on there site followed it through to evri site it had been delivered to the wrong address, so armed with the map I dispatched my daughter's to go find lol, they couldn't match the garden with a photo so I contacted temu through there chat box, and they contacted we quite quickly (I must say I was quite impressed?the lady was lovely and refunded me a credit on my account and emailed me straight away with confirmation, Great I thought.Then my lovely girls decided to check back gardens as well as knocking on doors and eventually found the parcel. I called temu straight back on the same number and got through quickly and told the second lady that we had now found the parcel, gave her the order number, she came back five minutes later saying she couldn't verify my account and would send a verification email, nothing again, I asked her to check that she had sent it and she read out a different email? Puzzled I said to her that it was wrong, expecting her to ask my name, address ect and the right email address none of which she had asked me for before. she didn't, she insisted there was nothing she could do to help me, even though she said she could see all the details of the missing (now retrieved) parcel. Bearing in mind she hadn't even asked me my name and details! I asked her what I was supposed to do as honesty is obviously not the best policy in this case as I now have over ??40 credit on my account which I wanted to give back? All she kept repeating was there was nothing she could do because of the wrong email address, even though I had received an email less than half an hour previously from them! Still she repeated there was nothing she could do so I ended the call. I will not be placing any more orders in the future and there credit as far as I'm concerned can just sit there.",1,05/05/2023
I havent had any issues with temu! I mean the items are dirt cheap so its one of those things where you know it may work or not! Their return process is quick and easy. Never any real issue.

I am not saying the products are top tier but everything I bought and received was just as described. I have ordered several times since and even gave many as gifts and they were loved by all. Out of all the items and I have probably purchased about 30 items at least, 1 thing was not anywhere near what the picture or description showed.

I dont want this ugly pink wallpaper they sent me i want the ONE I ORDERED.aboslutely disgusted and will be taking my complaint to my bank instead.",1,06/05/2023
"I am ordering regularly from Temu and I love them. I get all my orders before the estimated delivery date, never ever a parcel got lost or handled to me damaged. Also like their customer service, someone is always ready to answer if I have a question. When by mistake I clicked onto the wrong product and ordered it, could cancel my purchase in less than 5 minutes getting a full refund.",5,06/05/2023
DO NOT buy from Temu. I ordered something in November-December 2023 (I can't remember) but it never arrived. Even Amazon is better than this who made this super terrible site. They lure you into signing up to steal all your data and then make you spin this wheel that always lands on 100% of one thing you buy. Then you can't even shop because they make you download their storage-wasting app. DO NOT USE THIS SITE.,1,06/05/2023
This company uses materials derived from slave labor. Stop supporting fast fashion.,1,06/05/2023
I just picked up my order from Temu. Very disappointed and angry. The quality of the tShirts is awful!!! Everything is synthetic and plastic. I received different colors that what I ordered..Never again will I order clothes or shoes from Temu. You should have make clear that you?€?re using horrible Plastiks material Iris,1,06/05/2023
"Ordered a lot thru temu.Allways odd weird stuff I can't find In Shops Prices always cheap.What ever you buy check the actual sizes in writing and not the photos as they always seem bigger then what you get.Allways check what your getting as a lot of ads say a price with a photo next to it but it's for some thing similar or less of.Usually takes around 8 days to reach me in UK which is ok never returned anything because they are that cheap I'm not expecting much so if it's not what I want I just throw it away There delivery partners could do with getting better tho, was given an email saying delivery in 39 minutes so got some one to go to house so some one would be in only to get another email saying evri are now not delivering and it will be next delivery date(4 days later).Not ordering any thing more until evri get better.Also switch off no notifications or you will be bombarded with emails and notifications and take no notice of offers and discounts as they are very rarely genuine discounts.  And it's no good going on chat live to compain about any thing that isnt in the pop down menu as  it just gave me  completed questions to choose from.Thankyou got reply....I don't need any further assistance as I won't be shopping with you anymore so won't need the link.thankyou.",3,06/05/2023
"I have been buying from Temu for about 6 months. I tested the site with buying just a few low cost items. I had no expectations. It worked out fine. I usually purchase low cost items and do not expect top quality. I would not buy an expensive item or something like a brand name at a ridiculously low price. If it is too good to be true it is not true. If an item doesn't work I apply for a refund and the credit appears on my Temu account within minutes. Shipping usually takes about 2 weeks to Italy. Have not had any problems with customs. Only once was the shipment late and they gave me a 5 euro credit. For what it is, I have found Temu to be a good marketplace. If I need high quality and or a real brand name I shop at Amazon or a physical store. If I need something like an LED flashlight I will usually buy that at Temu. Merchants who list their items on Temu are always going to oversell or over promise. If you just keep this in mind and be realistic then it will be fine to shop there.",4,06/05/2023
"Not sure if the worst thing is feeling like you've been tricked or hustled into buying more things than you wanted in order to get ""free"" shipping or the fact that when the products arrive they are absolutely the lowest quality possible and are unfit for purpose. Avoid at all costs if I were you.",1,06/05/2023
"I am writing this review because I get cheated whenever I order something from Temu. This time, I bought an item for $5.98, and the description stated that I would receive ten pieces. However, I only received one piece. When I tried to return the item, I found out that the new price was $0.98, and they would only refund me $0.98 and keep the remaining $5.00. Additionally, if you purchase multiple items and need to return some because they sent you the wrong item, they only allow you to return two. Even if they sent you multiple wrong items, you're stuck with them and are out of your money. Be cautious when dealing with Temu and any company directly out of China. Although Alibaba is a little better with their dispute, the seller still tries to rob you.",1,06/05/2023
"I have been ordering from Temu for over 1 year now!  I've never encountered any issues with refunds/returns, credits, etc.  But delivery is a little slow here...10-14 days. Some merchandise always arrives damaged...cards, stickers, vinyl clings... anything paper or thin bendable items since all orders arrive in white mailing envelopes.  But refunds are easy and issued immediately after reporting it and providing a couple of photos. Very few items are inferior quality but again refund/returns are quick and easy!",4,06/05/2023

I've been buying from temu for the past 2 years and not once have I had an issue...they have good quality clothes.. and products..the trick is to read the reviews on the item your looking for...they are ppl like us and not gonna lie and they even take pics so you can see how it looks...hands down the best,5,07/05/2023

"I was a committed customer and spoke highly recommending them except for their MISLEADING promotions. The try ""bundles, spin the wheel, etc"". to buy people into buying more and marketing their company to others.  These gimics have hidden tricks so I stayed away from them.  On 5/26/24 I was selected to select 20 free items to choose  from a page which I did for being a valued customer.  I selected my items then found out I had to send their URL to 3 friends which I did. Then I received it was 10 and several of the ""pick now"" items were not part of the promo I had to order them for $27 which I did paid for them and was informed I had to market to 10 friends or didn't get the promotion. I sent my feedback canceled my order informed my friends and colleague's.  They want nothing more to do with TEMU.",1,07/05/2023
"I have ordered multiple products from Temu so far, most of them were as advertised and often surprisingly good quality. Yet it is to be pointed out that there is absolutely no certification of electronics nor are there other safety measures. This means that you will not be insured, should they ever light up in flames. Also chemicals are not controlled to eu standards, so I would definitely not order anything coming close to my mouth or having permanent skin contact. Lastly, this company has zero control over working conditions of its suppliers, while it is known that there are forced labor camps for Uyghurs in China - US lawmakers claim a high risk of those practises being involved.Also definitely it has to be mentioned how the website and app use every scammy design practise possible, in order to get people to purchase. Fake discounts, timers, giftcards and lotteries are the standard here. Beyond that, the App does require a lot of access to data and the parent company is not unlikely to sell these (you can find more info on that online). If you are looking for some little gadget that is sold by Resellers on Amazon or so in the same variant, but for a higher price, then I find it acceptable to still order here. Phone cases would be a good example. But with anything else I would rather think twice if it the cheap price is really worth the cost attached to it.",2,07/05/2023
There were a few products in my cart but I hadn't finished was going to come back to it. Next thing I know was an email thanking me for my order which I hadn't done. It was only a matter of minutes until I realised so I pressed cancel. Refund straight away. I've just noticed now that the money is down for credit which is what I didn't want. Anyone had issues like mine?,1,07/05/2023
My daughter paid money accidently into Temos account. Now she lost it! She has the proof why can you mot give her a credit to use. If that is what you are all about then i will not be buying from you again! Please advis. Elsie,1,07/05/2023
"Yes some products are not of great quality but you can return them for free. I found lots of good value and good quality products on Temu, anything lm not happy with the return process is easy. Found some items seems identical when compared with Amazon but at a fraction of the cost.",5,07/05/2023
Product didn?€?t arrive. Scammers used my details to try to scam me and almost got away with it. How does Temu allow this to happen? The scammers must have intercepted the package with my personal data. Scary. Don?€?t touch this website! Product never arrived.,1,07/05/2023
"Returned items to Temu following all instructions.  They rejected refunds on every item returned.  No reason given.

Games is rigged. Took energy away just so they won't be able to send cheap gifts under $10 but let them tell it its worth $25. I have picture proof. I was 0.01 energy away but they added .10 energy and took away 0.05 so now instead of 99.99 its 99.95. They make it confusing so people accept their lies. Then they don't send you the items you did win just 1 that is cheaper than the rest then reject the rest and says expired. Don't spam your family with this app and site. Shein doing the samething and I will be leaving them a review as well. I have gotten broken things though refund but make it seem like they're doing a lot since don't have to return when it would be impossible anyway. Send their packages in unreliable packaging.,1,08/05/2023
"Temu decided to cancel an order I placed claiming unusual payment activity. No idea what that means and no one can explain it to me. I have used the same two cards to pay for my orders. These accounts have my billing and shipping address, and phone number matching what Temu has and has used to charge and ship my orders for over a year. Even after providing screenshots of my bank account with the information and temu transactions showing, Temu is now claiming that they need time to verify if I have permission to use these forms of payment. Mind-blowing. Supposedly, a full refund was issued back to my financial institution, but after 6 days, I have seen nothing yet in terms of a refund. Their escalation team is a joke and whoever Amie is, hasn't replied in two days. Customer service is absolutely useless. I don't know what scam game Temu has decided to play, but this has been the worst purchasing experience and a big waiting game. In the meantime, I am not able to purchase anything on the website because both my cards keep getting rejected...not even declined. It's ridiculous.",1,08/05/2023
"I ordered  3 pieces mini  enamel  casserole set(16, 18 , 20 cm). I received I package with (16  &  18cm) casserole  set on May 11. I checked my order on Temu site and it stated that due to the size of my order  1 item (which is the 20cm casserole piece)would be delivered by land between  (May 15 -23).I still have not received  the last piece of my package. This is disappointing,  as this was going to be a wedding gift for someone , it means i will have to purchase something else, I  strongly would not recommend  anyone to use this site .",1,08/05/2023

"I would buy much more from Temu if it stopped using Evri to deliver. An hour before my parcel was due to be delivered today I got a message saying it could not be delivered and it would be the next working day which is now Tuesday due to the bank holiday. Perhaps the football cup final has caused this, who knows? My order contained items I wanted to use over the long weekend. Temu, get a decent delivery service. Reviews in the UK regularly highlight how unreliable Evri is (and Hermes before their rebrand, which appears to have changed little). My next order was building up in the 'cart', but is now deleted till I get this current order and stop being so annoyed about it, pay more and go to Amazon where I can get what I want the next day.",2,08/05/2023
"Well I was sceptical on Temu by reading previous reviews. The delivery came on time and the quality matches the price. I did not expect leather shoes with 7,- euros. It?€?s just not possible. The sizes matches EU sizes. I was particularly impressed with my sport leggings. They are better quality than I expected. Jewellery and make up is good too. My shoulder bag was exactly as was described on the website. So no misleading information.Nothing to complain about. Will order again and will spend more money on shoes to get better quality. But definitely will wear the ones I ordered.",5,08/05/2023

Everything works. No Problems with delivery or Refund.Good Value for the Money!,5,09/05/2023
"The products are of okayish quality. Some products are expensive compared to purchasing locally. But  once you add in the custom taxes and the prices are no longer competitive.Sadly, you only find out the custom charges after you purchase. I can buy the same products on sale locally and not have to pay exorbitant custom charges. First time I paid R100 in custome teaxes which was fine but the second time it was way high for the amount of goods purchased. So my family of 8 and l wont be purchasing from Temu again. I was looking forward to using Temu regularly but it just doesnt make sense!",1,09/05/2023
"It is cheap and cheerful but for the money you pay it's pretty good value in my opinion.  I recently ordered a dress and to be honest I wasn't overly optimistic but thought if I dont like it I haven't wasted much money and will put it down to experience.  It arrived and it fits perfectly.  The material, style and pattern are all lovely.  Wore it last night and got complimented on it.  So I enjoy shopping with Temu.  My advice is don't knock it until you try it.",4,09/05/2023

I think popularity has gone to their head",1,10/05/2023

I returned some footwear which were far too small,  I think they were Asia sizes so be warned when ordered trainers etc. Some trousers/jeans are a little on the short sude, i am 5ft 7 and have not once had trousers that are long enough, i just gave them to a friend.

I also requested a redirection in address for the other 2 items, 1 had shipped and 1 was still processing, I was told that it was too late to make a change.

The waiting time for delivery is really long but acceptable if that was true. I think they lost my parcel.

I understand that a lot of folks have had bad interactions with TEMU.On the other hand I have nothing but good things to say about them. Yes I have received a few orders missing something however I was never charged for the item missing.

I do however choose when they refund me that they just put it on my TEMU account. As I know I'll spend it eventually.,5,12/05/2023

I am amazed by this customer service quality and respect for customers who placed their trust into the company.I wish I knew about Temu before I had shopped at Macy's, I could save myself hundreds if not thousands of dollars.

They are manipulative and untrustworthy. They sucker you in by playing these games and win products you choose.

"5/20/2024  client/psymoore8 Temu has games you play for coupons. They give you a max amount of days to play, you get points for purchases, and when you complete the game (can take a month of daily playing, requiring referring friends, etc., browsing inventory repeatedly) you get two prizes picked beforehand and two coupons. The coupons I was playing for were for 40$ off a 100 dollar purchase and 30$ off a 100 dollar purchase. Well, I'm 99.8% done with the game, and they downgrade the coupons to 5$ and 6$ coupon bundles, each coupon requiring a 100 dollar purchase. I noted this was unethical (bait and switch) behavior, and their reps ""Sim**n, Ar**lo, A**o, & J*m""  refused to rectify the behavior. I certainly wouldn't have made purchases to earn points on that game or referred friends for such little coupons which expire in two days anyway. They need to hold to the agreed upon coupons throughout the game (per their rules), being I was close to winning and had many days (172 days) left before time expired on the game. They need to honor contracts. They claimed the coupon bundles were an upgrade, but I'd have to spend over a thousand to use each of the smaller coupons, and they expire in a day or two. The two coupons I was playing for would have only required a maximum of a two hundred dollar purchase (using both)... definitely a better deal.Then after sitting on hold with multiple reps the supervisor (Ka**a W*) claims I started a new game today with those coupons already there?? I told her that wasn't the case, that I've been playing for a long time, & to just look at my account. It takes a long time to get to 99.8% done with the game. They changed the coupons near the end in a bait and switch manner, then insulted me by saying I just started it that way??? Not so! Either Ms. W* didn't even look at my account, or TEMU plans on pulling this bait and switch scam on all their customers playing their games for coupons. I'm a retired state worker who is disabled, trying to live on a small retirement check, and big companies from overseas like Temu need to be held to the same guidelines as American companies or be barred from selling to Americans, period! I certainly think this company's practices are more worrisome than anything the Republicans say about Ticktock. Just an FYI to keep an eye on your coupons and file a complaint as soon as someone tries to switch them. I've already complained to the BBB in Boston Massachusetts about this behavior. Hopefully it will be resolved, otherwise, I'm done with TEMU!",1,13/05/2023

"Temu's advertised deals seem impossible to claim. They promote limited-time offers that vanishinstantly upon clicking, raising concerns about bait-and-switch tactics. Despite contacting Timu'scustomer service twice , I received scripted responsesthat lacked empathy or resolution. Each agent provided conflicting information, furtherfrustrating the experience. Disappointingly, even after presenting clear video proof of themisleading promotion, temu's support remained unresponsive, demonstrating a concerning lackof transparency.This experience is particularly disheartening because it affected my son. They promised alimited-time promotion for a tablet, creating excitement. However, when the tablet becameunavailable despite my timely efforts (which I have video proof of), my son blamed me formissing out. This highlights the negative consequences of Temu's misleading tactics, impactingnot just the customer but also their loved ones.Temu's deceptive marketing practices and unhelpful customer service require improvement. Iurge them to address these issues to regain customer trustEdit on 23 MAY Dear Temu Team,Thank you for your response. However, I have already contacted your customer service twice and provided clear video evidence showing that I followed all the promo terms and conditions. Despite this, I encountered the same issue on both occasions, and your agents were unable to provide a satisfactory resolution.Both times, the agents put me on hold to speak with the relevant department, only to return with unacceptable excuses and poor offers. This indicates that both the agents and a higher department are aware of the issue, yet no effective solution has been provided.This situation has not only wasted my time but has also caused significant disappointment and distress to my family. My son was particularly affected, as he was excited about the promotion, only to be let down by what appears to be a misleading offer.Unfortunately, I am unable to attach images or provide a link to my evidence in this review. Therefore, I request that Temu provides a direct way to contact me to resolve this issue, or they can use my existing contact information if they are genuinely willing to solve this problem.I am looking forward to a resolution that acknowledges the impact this has had and addresses my concerns effectively.Best regards,",2,13/05/2023

"**Title:** Concerns About Advertising Practices**Review:**I've recently noticed a recurring theme in the advertisements from Temu, IN MY YAHOO EMAIL, where the marketing strategy heavily relies on images of women in glamorous and revealing attire. While I understand the impact of visual appeal in advertising, I feel compelled to express my discomfort with this approach.It appears that the focus is shifted away from the actual products and their quality, which should be the primary showcase of any advertisement. Instead, the reliance on provocative imagery can be off-putting and may not resonate well with a diverse audience looking for genuine product information.I believe that TEMU has the potential to excel by highlighting the unique features and benefits of their products, rather than resorting to an overemphasis on sexualized imagery. A more product-centric advertising strategy could foster a more inclusive and respectful brand image that appeals to consumers based on the merits of the products themselves.I hope this feedback is taken constructively, as my intention is to see TEMU succeed by adopting advertising practices that respect and engage customers through the strength and quality of their offerings.",1,14/05/2023
No sense from the WhatsApp chat when I received a too-good-to-be-true offer on the pretence that my order arrived late.

"UPDATE: Check TEMU's reply. This is all you get from them ....Here is my story.I started ordering on Temu in Oct/Nov 2023. By now, I have placed 44+ orders and have reviewed 386 products. Quality wise, I would stay away from fashion and home decor (posters and some soft furnishings are really good, though). The good experiences I had with their products outweighed the bad ones and their return process was so fast that TEMU got me addicted. Everything went smoothly as long as Australia Post delivered my parcels.When the couriers are involved, nothing arrives. I had a bad experience with FastHorse who left the parcel out in the open despite the BIG NOTICE sign on the door.This month, TEMU decided to use another courier ""YTO"" ( is this company real??). The parcel was super important for a design project. YTO kept the parcel for a week and stated they couldn't deliver as my address was not safe! The address was AustraliaPost LPO's address (my local store) and it's the safest place that can be. This is the address I used to pick up the other 44 TEMU parcels! I contacted YTO via email and gave them all the instructions, I also provided them with my phone number so I could meet their lazy driver. They replied with a robotic message stating they would send my parcel back to China because they tried to deliver twice - on a Friday and on a Sunday (?!!)So we have a parcel that took 3 weeks to be delivered ( as opposed to 10 days which was the norm with AusPost) . The parcel is finally in Melbourne, ready to be delivered, and me, the recipient, is desperate to get it, but YTO decides not to deliver. It's just absurd.When I saw YTO was lying & not going to deliver I contacted TEMU, every single day for 3 days in a row.They refused to listen! I got bot like replies, nobody was reading my case. They kept repeating the same BS (""if YTO says my address is not safe, then the address is not safe""). The last day YTO were supposed to deliver, TEMU just refunded me what I paid without any other compensation. Nothing I said & wrote was acknowledged, although I did it several times and escalated the case twice.In normal circumstances I wouldn't have given much importance but this time the items were sold out and were part of a design project with a strict deadline. These items were carefully selected( specific posters and velvet cushion covers normally hard to find in that quality on TEMU).I wasted many hours to solve my last shipment. I still couldn't block these useless/ghost couriers from delivering my parcels in the future. So I'll probably close my TEMU account. My conclusion is quite simple:TEMU does not care about loyal customers since they have already collected our personal data.When they are done with you, they use ghost couriers (YTO, FastHorse Express) to simulate the maximum effort. They probably never send the parcels. Otherwise, how can we explain the bad ratings these ""couriers"" have (with complaints being all the same: lies about recipient's addresses/ parcels left on the street, literally). Why would TEMU still work with them if all they want is to sell us products?",1,15/05/2023

"If possible, I would give zero stars.I ordered several times from Temu.  Always many problems with delayed delivery, poor packaging with products getting crushed and falling out of the cheap poly mailers, all products are manufactured in Asia & majority are of very poor quality.While returns are easy to initiate and ship back at Temu's free return, it is time consuming and it takes a while to receive the refund.Recently Temu offered me '10 free items of my choice'. I was excited and took my time to select these as the selection offered was limited.  Once I was ready to proceed to provide the shipping info, Temu all of a sudden said I had to provide 'a' friend request to get the 'free gifts'. After processing one referral, they kept demanding more, with each spinning their on line wheel. They even demanded I share the phone number of my referrals which I would never do for privacy reasons. After providing 4 referrals, I was informed that there was a $0.50 remaining balance for my 'free gifts'. They would not remove the balance nor let me pay it. They refused to give me my 'free gifts'.I contacted their custom service multiple times both via phone and email.  I advised them that they were tracking various Canadian advertising laws and regulations. Each time their staff, incl 'supervisors', put me on hold for 1.5 hrs. The total of my 'free gifts' came to $337.71.One customer service rep offered me a $20 credit instead of my 'free gifts' and a supervisor offered $10 instead.They have the worse customer service, are in breach of various government laws, and lie to their customers.UPDATE 21 May 2024:After receiving Temu's response below, I once more contacted their customer care department and talked to Joseph, employee ID20012350.  I was constanu put on hold for nearly 45 min after having explained to him the purpose of my call.  At one point he confirmed that 2 of my 4 friend referrals have been accepted and that I was 'credited' three cents for one referral and seven cents for the other and because there was a remaining balance of fifty cents, I would not qualify for the free gifts that were promissed to me.Joseph repeatedly reached out to his 'Higher Support team'. They initially offered me a twenty percent to a maximum of twenty dollars discount on my next order which I declined stating what is is not acceptable and I should get my 10 free gifts of the equivalent of just over three hundred and thirty seven dollars.  Next I was offered a trn dollar credit note towards my next purchase which I declined for the same reason.Temu lacks respect for their customers and does not take any review or legit concern seriously. Temu continues to refuse to make this right which speaks volumes about their business etiquette.22 May 2024I received a call back from Joseph last night around 20:30 advising that a manager would call me back within 1 hr.I is 12:55 the next day and nobody has bothered to call Mr back yet.",1,15/05/2023
Love this site.I've been using this App for a long time and have never had any issues. The goods are of great quality and delivery is fast. Complaints are dealt with promptly and very efficient. Will continue to buy from Temu. Such a wide choice and great value ???? ????,5,15/05/2023
"Temu is very difficult to work with.  If you are lucky enough to get an actual human to discuss returns with, they just wont shut up?€?they waste so much of your time going on and on with details you don't care about, the woman just wouldn't shut up.  I'd rather pay a little more, buy from Amazon, easy easy returns compared to Temu and more reputable.  I've ordered some decent things, I ordered stuff that was really JUNK when it came.  Some of their descriptions are inadequate, like buying their heated vests without a battery to heat them. Waiting 12 days to get the heated vest only to find out it doesn't come with a battery.The battery is in small print you don't even see so you basically get a heated vest that doesn't heat.  Battery extra.",1,15/05/2023
"This isn?€?t a serious company, beware. I now know why they get so many bad reviews.Today was delivery day, 2.30-4.30 they told me. So I stayed home all afternoon. Nobody came.

"I was sucked in by the special offers they?€?re offering with guarantees that I?€?d get money back if my products are not delivered on time. I keep getting inundated with messages about my delivery and timeslot and guess what? It never happens. This is the third time I?€?ve had messages saying that my products will be delivered within a two hour time slot and then I get a message sorry we?€?re not able to deliver today, I?€?m very suspicious .

I ordered twice on Temu in Austria. Arrived both on the estimated time and in great quality.,5,15/05/2023
I wanted to write a review because I am amazed how good this is. The app was so easy to  shop with. The discounts and prices beat anything I have seen before. My basket to payment was seamless. I was kept up to date costantly on progress of my shipment. It arrived 11 days later and I love the clothing. Much better quality than I anticipated. Very impressed.,5,15/05/2023
"FAO C.E.O TEMU.After 114orders the service is very poor. I am a ?€? valued customer ?€? but the fish land game has not played fairly, things are always done in temu?€?s favour and I am leaving and going to Sheen when I get my goods and monies back. I am sick and tired of being taken for a fool and would like a senior executive to speak to me. Did you see the recent article about temu?€?s practices recently which was damning at best, particularly of the customer services division. The items are cheap, nowhere near the RRP but ok for the price but clothes, lights don?€?t last long and fires are prone to setting houses on fire. You have many customers but many are not happy and want something positive done to HELP US as opposed to brushing us off. This is what we get?€?

"I bought a faux leather jacket last month price is 29.65pounds, the price is just reasonable not very cheap for not a faux leather jacket ,I have the order number as PO-210-07856731520632563 it was delivered on May 2nd by EVRi and the jacket that I received was having wrinkles all over,I had it hanged for 2 weeks, it didn't work then I ironed it several times and it still doesn't work. Apparently the person who sent out this jacket were fully aware of the condition of this product but still have it shipped, I can't wear that jacket given that it is in such bad condition. Well it's not that cheap and the product is in such bad state. What more can you ask for.DavidPlease upload the pics to show people what have to do with the defective jacket I already uploaded to your email thanksThe pics still not here ??Ok I have got this irresponsible standard reply from this company without saying sorry and keep saying they have strict rules to ensure their product quality and you can tell Temu have no intention to admit their wrong doing they don?€?t even bother to spend time to reply your complaint If you guys think you can accept a defective product and get full refund afterwards you can try your luck then but I will certainly won?€?t recommend Temu to peoples that I know. I still don?€?t know why trust pilots ignore my request to upload the photos of the jacket",1,16/05/2023
"Update 21.5.24: Thanks for your answer, Temu. Do you have an instruction for getting my usual iPhone setting 100 % back without re-installing? This would be really appreciated!19.5.24. I was such a happy customer the first time, I bought from Temu. Great stuff for excellent prices. Yesterday I bought for the second time. After the payment step my iPhone 14 suddenly got very slow. I uninstalled the Temu app immediately and deleted browser history etc. But... Something is changed in the phone setup. It is slower. Some pages show up differently. So sad to have this experience. I know Temu has been accused of spyware, but this is even more annoying than giving all my data away.",1,16/05/2023

"Here's how it works:You like a product. You place it in your basket. Temu forces you to buy more items until they're happy with how much you're spending. Even after you've spent money you didn't want to spend, they'll beg you to spend more. Congratulations, now you're addicted.",3,16/05/2023
Not my first time ordering products from Temu. You would think a returning customer would have some standing with orders. Not Temu. I ordered with a credit card and they repied they need more proof of ownership.

"Does not provide a way for disabled people to return items - item arrived damaged, due to evri leaving in an unsafe area. Tried to return for a refund, but temu said the only option was to go to an evri store and return that way - unlike all other stores nowadays, they do not offer collected returns which means some disabled individuals cannot return items.",1,16/05/2023

"What ever you do, do not order from this site as they are a complete con. I ordered some military boots for ??14.97 with the current reduction,  I wayed almost 2 weeks for the item. I received a email from temu that evri will be delivering my item. When evri updated the tracking to say that they had delived the item I went to the post office to collect it. Woe and behold, no parcel was there to collect. I contacted temu and temu asked me if I wanted a refund or a credit applied for the same amount to my temu account. I opted for the credit as it was an immediate thing where the refund back to my bank account would take 5-10 days. When temu done the credit to my temu account I went to order the boys again,  to my horror,  the booys weelllre now twice the original amount. I've figured out now, what temu do, they will constantly bombarded you will all these cheap deals and discounts and when you choose one and make the order,  the order is deliberately delayed so when you again contact temu about the delayed item,  the advisor will apologise perfusely and offer you credit for the amount you paid,  when you then go back to order the same cheap item at the discount price, you will be shocked to see that the item has now doubled I'm price from the original discounted price that was previously offered. Its all one big scan and all very deliberately done to make yoy then purchase the item foe double the price. I will be making it my duty to inform as much people as I can about this scam , con of a shopping site. Anything they offe you will be just a trick to get you ro later pay more by not sending out the item then making it look like they have done you a favour by offering you a credit on your account. I will be setting up a Instagram account specifically to expose this company and the trick and tactics they use to swindle your hard earned cash out of you. Temu are complete con artistists who fool you with random discounts and offerss that are not at all real and just designed to fool you into spending on rubbish that isn't worth 2 pence,  they are the most bogus company out there and they make their money by working with shoddy delivery companies like evri who are part of their scam.

"Temu never used to have a minimum order amount and this made an excellent shopping experience.Then they introduced a minimum order amount of $15 AUD. Although this provided some degree of frustration, it was manageable.However, what really killed Temu for me was the excessive imposter of a $55 AUD minimum order requirement.Totally unjustifiable in my humble opinion and they have lost me as a customer I feel that they are out to improve their bottom line at the expense of Australian customer and I advise all Australians to give them a miss. Their are plenty of alternatives out there????",1,17/05/2023
"Fake shop that takes advance of you.They force you to shop for more and more to get the free delivery!Sending product of bad quality without refunding your money. They force you to send products back to them and then you got no refunds.Check everything before you buy anything and before you pay!And the price you have to shop for are increasing more and more before you can cashout and finish shopping for free sending your order.Temu are pressing you to shop for more and more money for every time you place an order.And to contact customservice is hopeless. I've been trying that with an order that never arrived. I didn't get my money back but I got them as credit at temu, and the price for free shipping was then increased to kr 330.

I am using Temu to buy doll's house miniatures. As I work in different scales it's not a big problem to me if sizes are off, buyers beware and read descriptions carefully for accurate sizes.

"Do you wonder why your products from Temu are cheap, I will tell you why because they sell your information on the black market. They are able to keep their cheap quality goods cheap because after you shop with them, they take your information, steal it and sell it on the black market so your info is threatened. Moreover, they use Child Labour (illegally) to make their products. The company is in investigation by the US Government. It's also a Chinese company of whom created another app that steals information but had to shut down due to legal reasons. Summarised if you value your information and don't want someone else having it, not buying products from illegal labour, DON'T BUY FROM TEMU! Note that they will try to hide this review and close it down because they don't want us finding out.Edit 1: They completely dodged my argument and are saying something else in the reply section",1,17/05/2023

Thing is they didn't sell the other items (Laptop Battery and a cream).  I proceeded to checkout, entered my information and was informed that I needed to purchase a minimum of $35.00 ... Wish the company would have stated this from the start, however, I now see that this the corporate marketing gig.  ... Oh well, I was irritated enough to leave the website without a purchase.  This will be remembered.",2,17/05/2023
"Great company and I have not had a bad experience since I started using them over a year ago. They offer good products at very reasonable prices. Shipments are always received on time and I even get five dollars back if there is a delay in shipment, which never occurs. My only complaint with any product from China is that you never get instructions for whatever you buy, so know what you are ordering and how to use it. By the way, I have the same problem with Amazon products from China too. No directions.",4,17/05/2023
"UPDATE:5/18/2024:**BEWARE**: If you return and item and the post office loses your return package and even if you have proof of that with a case number from the post office. Temu will keep your money and rip you off. The temu reps kept squawking about a return receipt. Even if the temu customer was responsible for a return receipt it is not free and costs $3.65 for mail receipt $2.32 for email receipt. So heads up on their new scam to rip people off when the post off loses your return package. This is isolated to orders using your account credit because they can't get away with it as easily if you paid for it. Paypal especially would not ever let temu get away with ripping you off when the post office loses your package. They are boldface lying in their reply and notice their answer doesn't pertain to my concern at all because they don't care, they refused to help me after 15 days after I contacted them several time. Typing a B.S answer doesn't change facts or the horrible way they treat people. Stay diligent concerning these shysters. Update 3/9/2024:No more late package $5 credit because they now give themselves a wider delivery window then in the past. I am waiting longer for packages. It used to take a week max for delivery now it's double that. They are a brand new company according to google so I will go easy on them but still be honest. Superior to wish,ali express and ebay because they ship out sooner. That's huge in and of itself. No one wants to wait months for their order that we all know doesn't need to take that long. They offer free shipping, I'm loving that. Next thing that is a biggie is there is no save for later list. If you are selling things for under a certain price point and wanting customers to load up there carts for max sales then Temu customers need a saved for later list. People forget and they are busy. A saved for later list is a must.Also we need a favorites list. If we really like an item,sellers need to know so they know what people like and they can keep on keep it in stock and keep the orders/sales going. Biggest of all so far Super Awesome you are using USPS,we hate Fedex and UPS they are So slow BUT ditch the shipping partner. We understand that you need trucks to haul all the orders to USPS and hopefully you get your own eventually but the shipping partner is slowing the deliveries down. People are on a their shopping kick want their stuff asap,too many days go by and they start to get annoyed, ""where the heck is my order?"" Also the sellers on the temu site need to list the ingredients of their cosmetics,especially the powders. Alot of peopIe do not want talc in their eye shadows and face powders. I don't buy any of that type of item unless I can see what's in it. I am telling you these things out of brutal honesty because if you listen to what consumers want they will keep coming back and buying. Do better then wish,ali express and ebay and you will come out on top. I am liking what I am seeing, so at this point I am rooting for you Temu. Update:My packages have been sitting with their shipping partners for several days with no movement after repeated requests to contact their shipping partners to have hand my packages off to USPS. They said if my packages are delivered late they would give me a credit. If I wanted some of my money back I sure as heck would not want a credit to torture myself and order again and go through the same B.S again. It's not looking good for them. Another star removed for their $10 order minimum and really poor customer service. Their very lacking,poor attitude and super unhelpful. Refunds are easy though.",1,17/05/2023
"I was a loyal supporter of Temu since it started in Aust., however their recent decision to make a minimum order requirement has really annoyed me. Even more so as they have gradually increased the amount AND it varies from person to person. My attempt  to contact them has been fruitless. They will be losing my business and even more importantly my recommendation to others. Temu claims it's to do with reducing packaging, which is a feeble attempt to appeal to environmentalists. What rubbish, it's all about money and not what customers want.",2,17/05/2023
"Always delivering high quality for very low prices.I doubted them at first because of lots of negative feedback here on trustpilot but now I regret not having used Temu more to save money. You can get almost anything here for great prices!I have made both simple and complex orders, in most cases the delivery has been free of charge so only paying for the actual products, and I always receive my full order without any faults and all in good quality.One annoying thing is lots of purchases can only be made in the app and their app spams you with notifications and keeps telling you won a price. This is only making Temu look sus but still I absolutely don?€?t regret using it because it?€?s crazy you get so much good products for these prices.",5,17/05/2023

The second parcel was so badly packaged that I am not surprised there was damage.  Bashed in boxes with contents falling out is not something I want to receive.Also, the relentless emails.  I unchecked all the options and even after a parcel was dispatched, I received 7 more until its arrival.I?€?m not happy about a company claiming to operate from Boston when they don?€?t and, having looked into it more, I have decided it?€?s not a company I wish to spend money with and have therefore cancelled my account.",1,18/05/2023

While temu has a a few positives that could be said the vast majority is negative from my perspective. I believe they operate to steal identities and follow them to the dark web. I believe these Chinese companies are meant to undermine Amazon with cheap options. You should know that they're scamming right from the beginning using their fraudulent bonus programs in which they get users to sign up but yet never actually give them any real bonus just making them spam their friends and they always fall one penny short of getting what they're promised you can buy inexpensive Chinese goods from Amazon and keep your information out of the hands of these shysters,1,18/05/2023
"I actually like this company. Prompt results when you call customer service for return items. Also missing packages. However the down side is delivery. They use 2 different companies and you don't get to choose. 1 of the companies is (iMile) which has always delivered much faster. The other is J T Express, which seems to be what Temu uses first, delayed packages constantly so longer wait, also they have undelivered packages. Although Temu answers promptly and refunds quickly, they need to not use this J T express a frequently.",5,18/05/2023

Surprised about all the criticism Temu is receiving lately. Never had any problems with it. Always had a reliable service experience.,5,18/05/2023
"I ordered something that had sat in my account for months. I attempted to order something else and somehow the order switched to something I did not want. I immediately cancelled it, as the site allowed, and told me I would get a refund within a time frame. However, the item  was delievered. I have tried to contact Temu, but I can only chose to chat to a robot or say it was not received, which it will not let me chose anyway.",1,18/05/2023
"Temu advertised great free shipping and then they had minimal spend, it started at $15 then $22 then $33 now $45. I had used Temu many times before this started, so I queried this and was told it had to do with packaging recycling, and that I could opt out if I weren't a greenie so I shopped again. There was no limit great says I tried again and hit the same $45 limit, my neighbor who put me on to Temu is having the same problem. Is this legal, it's not in Australia.",2,18/05/2023
We bought 2 prepaid Mastercards for only shopping on Temu. One for myself and 1 for my husband. We ordered and had a balance for later . We tried to buy something and the balance is only a few cents The card has been hacked and no one else can use them. Temu has obviously taken the balance or have given the numbers to someone. Buyer please be aware and never ever will we order from this company again..Very very disappointed..,1,18/05/2023
"I received my first order from Temu yesterday and I was delighted! It only took 7 days to arrive after placing the order. I ordered clothing and my expectations were low tbh. ???? I am 5ft 11 so I was not expecting the jeans to fit in the leg but they do! It?€?s great that Temu accommodates us tall gals. And, the prices are fantastic. I got three pairs from Temu that cost around the same as I?€?d pay for one pair from a high street store.Thanks Temu, you?€?ll be seeing me again soon. ????",5,18/05/2023
"I recently had a frustrating experience with Temu's delivery service. My package, which was supposed to arrive last week, still hasn't shown up. To make matters worse, there have been no updates on the tracking information for days, leaving me completely in the dark about its whereabouts. I contacted customer service, but their responses were slow and unhelpful, providing no clear explanation or resolution. This lack of communication and transparency is unacceptable, and it has made me seriously reconsider ever ordering from Temu again. Reliable delivery is crucial, and unfortunately, Temu has fallen short.",1,19/05/2023

"Temu has been a positive shopping/buying experience so far for me. The old saying,""you get what you pay for"" seems to hold true. For the money spent the quality is ok, Temu promptly refunds damage claims and wrong size merchandise. No problem with charges with CC and PayPal. Any disappointments? Sure. However, compared to the true bargains and fun shopping, the entertainment value can make it more fun than the casino!",5,19/05/2023

"Have always had a great service.Cheap Goods ??????A couple of weeks delivery from the other side of the planet ??????Good refund policy??????What's not to like, as long as you read the details, accept that minimum orders exist, opt out of notifications if they're bugging you and realise that they are there to make money so freebies are unlikely then I'd say you'd be happy with the service.  If buying clothing double check the sizes (although I see my app is now showing local sizes).A little shocked at some of the 1 star rhetoric that's obviously skewing the system.  I'm exceedingly happy with maybe 50%of orders, pretty happy with 30%, 15% a bit tatty and 5%duff.

"I ordered jam jar labels as shown in the pictures on the Temu site.  The ones that were delivered are 1.5 cms across! I don't have a pen that could write that small and, if I did, no-one could read it.  What a con!  By not giving the actual dimensions of the product but showing a picture with them on a jar of jam (photo-shopped, of course), they are being deceitful and dishonest.  They didn't email me with details of my order so I don't have any way to contact them.  This is a company which I will never deal with again no matter how cheap their products are.  Just imagine how they treat their workers if they treat their customers with this much contempt.",1,19/05/2023

However, my expectations are not the highest, they are according to the price I pay. Once I had an issue where they sent me the wrong product and I sent them a pic and they refunded me without asking for the product back (it was also cheap and was not worth sending back). Generally I am pleased and I am going to buy from Temu again as I find their designs very pleasing and bring me joy!",5,19/05/2023
Temu actually has legit common everyday products for 25% the cost of going in store ANYWHERE. Downside is it takes 2 weeks to ship. It?€?s like shopping at your local big box store expect they actually have the product in stock sans they will help you find the rest of what you?€?re looking for?€? if you?€?re willing to wait a couple weeks to get it. You?€?re not getting better quality by going to your local store. That?€?s a guarantee,4,19/05/2023
Everything is fake on Temu. Especially reviews. Somehow they manage to create tens of thousands fakes.,1,19/05/2023
I have purchased several items on Temu and they have all arrived quickly and were at a good price what I find misleading about the site is if you ask Temu Customer Service to speak to a seller to get more details about a listing you are told you have been connected to the seller when in fact your queries are answered by what Temu call a Merchant Customer Service Agent not the seller. This has happened to me on two separate occasions recently and when I questioned who I was speaking with I was told it was a Merchant Customer Service Agent acting on behalf of the seller and they appear to only have access to the details that are in the sellers listing description which I have already read and the answer to my question is not in the listing description that is why I wanted to speak directly with the seller. In my opinion you should be told you are speaking with a Merchant Customer Service Agent and not be lead to believe you are speaking directly with the seller when you are not.,4,19/05/2023
You are not taking  my card you just lost a good customer,1,19/05/2023

"Ad for Temu app is misleading. Often said you get free items just for installing the app. But after installed the app, it said you have to purchase certain amount of items to be qualified to receive the free item.Also if you try to purchase some items and the total value is less than 45 AUD, it doesn't tell you until you fill in all your contact details and your credit card number and click the final submit button.The integrity of this company is concerning.I do not appreciate the minimum order value. If you must, at least display that in the first intance when user goes into the cart, not after they finished filling in delivery details and credit card details.

I tried to order 3 items (2 products) today and on both items it was advertised as free shipping. That was a great BIG shining LIE. Total order was about A$20 but the checkout said I had to order $34+ more product because a min. order of A$55. It took ages with 3 agents on chat to get absolutely no where. Looks like AliExpress (min. order of A$15 for free shipping) or eBay. Temu are liars. Edit: After temu.com's reply I contacted their chat support again and they just continue to spew the same lies and reply with the standard spiel. The agents show no honesty.  Even now hours after my first review their site still offers free shipping. Very deceptive company. They have lost a customer as long as they continue their dishonest business model.Edit 2: Temu is still keeping to their deceptive advertising practices. Now Trustpilot is wanting more information including my phone number to give to temu. I don't know what bulldust told Trustpilot but Trustpilot threatened to take my review down if information wasn't sent. Why is with that?,1,20/05/2023

"I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Temu. Ultimately, Temus offers some great products at extremely discounted rates. But, you do have to beware if some big inconsistencies. I would never make any major purchases over Temu and suggest taking time to read reviews and compare pricing as ive also found the same or similar products for cheaper elsewhere. I have placed nearly 20 orders over the past year (2023/2024) and overall, I have been very happy with the products I received. Their return policy is pretty simple and straightforward. Where I started to encounter issues is when they changed the primary shipping company they outsource to. When I first started using Temu as a vendor, one of the things that stood out to me in comparison to their competitors was how quickly I received my package from time of order. Initially I would get my package within 7-10 day from the date I placed the order. Approximately Feb/March of 2024 I noticed that the time between placing the order and receiving my package was getting further and further apart to where it's nearly 3-4 weeks before I'm even getting my products. They switched their shipping partners to a company called Uni Uni and since then, I've had some major issues, aside from significant delays in shipping. They don't provide regular shipping updates, they don't notify you or contact you upon delivery, they will indicate a package has been delivered when it hasn't etc. My last straw was when I ordered a package that was ""out for delivery."" For nearly 7 full days, I couldn't get any straightforward answers as to where my package was from Temu or Uni Uni, I spent several hours on the phone trying to tack it down. On May 7th I had to escalate the matter to a customer service supervisor before I finally got any resolution. They finally refunded me for the amount of the package and blacklisted Uni Uni as a shipping provider (on my account). I appreciate the Temu customer service supervisor did his best to correct the issue for me; however, just be warned. Shipping service is very dependent on the provider they choose to utilize. Since having Uni Uni blacklisted, I have packages I ordered and have received in less than ten days (ordered May 12th Recieved may 17th) where as, I still have packages I ordered prior to the issue (orders placed April 29th and May 3rd), and have yet to recieve them.",4,20/05/2023
"Unfortunately, the minimum spend, nullifies its use, minimum spend that also continuously increases, 10-15-25-45-80??? as minimum spend... in 2024 a shop with a minimum spend? I'd rather pay shipping than spend 80 on useless stuff when I only needed something 3/4 euro. Back to Aliexpress then, which by the way the minimum has it, only for choice orders and it is 10 euros, not at Temu levels then. The packing story, safeguard is pure baloney, when buying there is already an option to donate to plant trees.",1,20/05/2023

I was also issued a credit in the ""Shop Like A Billionaire"" but I can't find it either.  Plus that program is asking to send them additional users.  I don't know that many people.

I have replied to Temu it seems you can only go back 90 days for refunds.    I agree with other customers about delivery and service 5stars.    But I have 4 units that have failed for different reason?€?s.  After the 3 months I seems then that you only get a 3 month warranty.   Some items are very expensive. Am not sure but under uk law it?€?s 12 month warranty.    I will not buy again until the question I asked about 12 month warranty.  3 month warranty on a ??100 item is scandalous and not helpful for the environment I would not recommend this company and the reason I have a low score,1,20/05/2023

"Prices are at a point that if the item is broken, doesn't fit, it's not worth returning. I have given or thrown away lots of items, because of this. Unless you have multiple items from your order, to return, then worth it.I also find that the price reduction offers are often the same, if not more, than the item without the offer. Example 90% off $15.63 regular priced item, is not $15.59. Temu needs to do better or stop being shady in this regard.",3,21/05/2023
"I have ordered from temu couple times and currently haven?€?t had an issue with delivery or refund or anything . The only thing is that the parcel tend to take a bit of time to arrive .

But remembering the price / the cost it?€?s still a bargain especially with free delivery .",4,21/05/2023

"I wish I could go lower than 1 because I would. I called in specific to being taken advantage of over their games, you get to 99 percent and they take it away and make you start a new game and tell you to start inviting people. Are you kidding! So you want me to keep inviting ppl and get nothing. You will no longer get support from my household.  UPDATE! As everyone seen Temu replied and wants me to call them quick! I did yesterday and your employee said they couldn?€?t help me and refused to let me speak with a supervisor?????€? what am I calling for again? The response I got is why I deleted Temu from my phone. Should have helped yesterday but apparently I was not taken seriously until the app is gone and no more orders.

Too many in fact ????.Never had an issue.Today they raised the minimum order from 0 to ???25 which is extremely harsh.I contacted support and was informed there is nothing they can do so I informed them I an deleting my account and posting  a review of my experience. This is how companies treat loyal customers. Well this is one ex loyal customer.,1,22/05/2023
"I have given up on Temu.  Thank you.  I am going over to Shein.  Temu promises you the world and gives you NOTHING.     You try to be creative with your marketing, however you fail miserably.

"Very good quality and prices. Truly Great value for money. I've bought watches, clocks, kitchen stuff, boots, jumpers, phone chargers tools, calculators, a dart board, and so many more things. I've bought training shoes 8 pairs, jeans, two jackets, underpants etc etc. All fit great. Be careful with offers e.g. ""Spend ??75 to get ??75 vouchers of credit"" : you have to spend the credit vouchers within 12 hours before it dissappears. To use ??35 voucher, you have to spend ??105 (voucher use is limited to 33% of purchase). So if you get ??75 pounds worth of vouchers, to get the full benefit, you would have to have had ??300 pounds to spend within the next 12 hours. This breaks down as ??75 pounds in order to get the original ??75 pounds matched vouchers. And then ??225 pounds to get the ??75 voucher reduction at 33%. And all within a 12 hour period.",3,22/05/2023
I have had great experience with Temu over the last 12 months with free shipping for orders over $15.  Suddenly their free shipping is for orders over $40.  Got the rubbish explanation or should I say Blah Blah Blah.  I'm not buying the rubbish they are presenting as an excuse to raise the spend for free shipping. Lets be honest a vast majority of the items sold are junk however they do have some really good items at a great price.  Temu please note that your shipping policy still says STANDARD SHIPPING FREE.  My current cart is over $15 and free shipping is still listed.  Couldn't get it through the online Agents head what exactly I was trying to explain.,2,22/05/2023

The clothes I have bought are beautifully made and plenty of plus size bargains.  I don't understand the bad reviews. I have had instant refunds on broken or not working items. ( A very few). Thanks for all the kitchen gadgets that are so useful,and cheap storage items.  Great. Measurements are carefully given so you can usually not make a mistake. I think Temu do care, in my opinion.",5,23/05/2023
"Disgusting company. Dodgy products. Rubbish return policy. Fake postage tracking codes. Complete liars. Don?€?t bother. An example of what happened, I had ordered a drone which was supposedly sent to my post office box and Temu said it was delivered. However when I went to pick it up, Australia Post had no record of it being delivered to the post office. So I called Back and enquired on multiple occasions to find out where the parcel was and they said it was delivered. however after multiple discussions in person and online with Australia Post, they confirmed that it had not arrived but was in Singapore, as per the tracking link. I?€?ve then sent request for a refund to Temu and they did not entertain anything but they stated that it had been delivered. So instead of providing the product or a refund, they ignored the evidence that I had forwarded from Australia Post and sided with their vendor, despite the obvious evidence that the link did not show that the product had been delivered. They did not even check the link to see that it had not been delivered, but was still sitting in Singapore. As a result of all this I urge people not to trust Temu or their complaints policies or their tracking link or their refund policy because they are clearly in it to gain your funds and are not ready to entertain the customers experience.",1,23/05/2023
Temu what can I say? DO NOT buy security cameras from these guys. The apps for the security cameras that have been sold by Temu have malware Advertising including pressuring you to use a cloud service hosted in China. I do not consent my information or security footage being sent there. These apps need to be investigated and removed off the google play store. (NEVER CLICK on any link) DO NOT BUY MEDIA DEVICES on Temu especially geolocation products or cameras.,1,23/05/2023
I've only recently used Temu. I can honestly say the things I've ordered 90% has been okay. I've been more than happy with my purchases. In my opinion what makes it 100%. Is the customer after care team. They are what helps make a company great. This has been my experience with Temu. A first class service in helping to resolve my issue straight away. I would like to give them a massive thank you.,5,23/05/2023

My response to the reply from TEMU: I do not even have the Temu app - that makes it all the more frustrating !  I have tried to cancel notifications from their website but to no avail. I notice that there are many, many complains on line regarding the same problem, ie. people being unable to get rid of pestering Temu ads from all their apps, and every website they open.  Temu is a pernicious little organisation that hides behind the difficulties they generate when people attempt to cancel their omnipresent ads.Their ads are counterproductive because they have lost me as a customer and no doubt hundreds, if not thousands of others due to their over-the-top advertising !",1,23/05/2023
I have had nothing but great service and quality products from Temu. People need to be aware that they need to pay import duty on items and that includes VAT- still much cheaper than shopping locally.My packages arrive within two weeks (South Africa) and I have not been disappointed!Cloths and shoes just need to be ordered a size or two bigger than you would buy in a South African store eg I order UK size 13.5 or 14 shoes and in South Africa I comfortably fit in a size 13.As far as I know my data has been kept safe and I use Apple Pay and have not had any problems.,5,23/05/2023
"Late 2023 I made a purchase and all went well. Two recent purchases ?€?one normal delivery and a second made the very next day paying for expedited delivery ?€? have been nothing short of problematic. In both cases, Temu indicates a delivery timeframe when placing the order. Immediately upon ordering, that timeframe is restated and is longer. In the case of my expedited order, which I had to pay extra for and that was made ONE day after the normal delivery, it has still not arrived. And that is still days after the stated number of business days. But clever Temu, they also have a date range that is well outside the stated number of biz days. Trust me: I have the receipts. But ok, I get notification from the delivery company the package is out for delivery yesterday (a Saturday). It never arrives. I was home all day. Phone on. And no delivery and no updates. It took quite a lot of back and forth with their chat bot to finally get and agent. I asked not only where is my package (they have no clue) and to at least refund the expedited delivery fee. Summary: nope. They?€?re holding to their date range (again, it?€?s longer than it says in biz days?€?happy to show screen shots) Really. And was after nearly 25 minutes on the phone. At some point what?€?s your time worth. Mine = no more Temu orders. Also really.",1,23/05/2023

"Unfortunately I shopped once with this company and never will again. I had no idea about their sneaky policy which I?€?m now reading about in lots of these one star reviews. Once you?€?ve made a purchase, on your next purchase, there is a minimum spend. Mine went straight up to $55. So the dog bed I purchased was the wrong dimensions and I couldn?€?t swap it I had to refund and repurchase, but I wasn?€?t able to just repurchase the correct size, I had to fill my cart with junk until I got to the minimum spend. They disguise this as a SUSTAINABILITY CLAUSE! They say it?€?s to minimise waste and optimise packaging. I said so how is is sustainable to force people to buy things they don?€?t need to fulfil the requirements? Unbelievably sneaky and dishonest. They would not remove the minimum. Be VERY careful of this company. I?€?m assuming Chinese owned and probably stealing our data. Absolutely disgusted and didn?€?t get anywhere with customer service either. Don?€?t waste your time.",1,23/05/2023

I previously had no minimum spend amount and I was purchasing very regularly with them, some orders over ???80 at a time, however when I looked at my account the other day it was ???20 min. I contacted the chat service and was told that they now have a new policy and would encourage me to spend at least 20 I asked if they could just keep my account the same as before and I was told no. They told me to just add more items.Then today the minimum has gone up to ???25. Other friends minimun have gone up to ???35 not sure what mind games TEMU are playing. I certainly won't purchase from them again.",1,23/05/2023
Used to love this site until minimum order amounts kept going up. Waiting for an order to turn up and then I will close my account.They will give you a speech about sustainability with packaging which is complete and utter tosh. Forcing people to buy crap they don't want just to reach the ever climbing minimum spend is not what I call sustainable. Goodbye Temu,1,23/05/2023

"Warning!!!Warning!!!warning!!!Don't ever play the Temu app game that you will get free staff when you reach a certain 100% level while playing the game collecting points and feed fish and water the plants on fishland or farmland ... it's a waste of ______ time .Don't ever played it ,its just encourage you to spend more money and buy more staff with a very low quality products that you can also find on your dollarstores in exchange for more points to earn to feed your fish or watered the plants. They control how much points you earned and when your almost getting your free staff they lessened the percentage of the points, so will need more, to get more you wilk need to buy staff to get more to feed and watered . Again it's a waste of time and will not buy any staff from Temu again.

Such greed and horrible customer service. Never again.,1,24/05/2023
Not sure about this company. Seem to confuse you into buying more items. Receive coupons then pick items to buy on that coupon(leads you to believ)you to checkout items with the same value as the coupon. So free right? Wrong. You still pay for the items you?€?ve picked that you think have been covered by the coupons. Very clever marketing? Or maybe a legal scam I reckon. Be wary of the cost of what you put in your basket. . Especially if you are sent a very flashy message that you?€?ve got coupons to use up!

It starts at 10 then 15 then 25.Currently I know it was because of the credit return because I had my item in cart and it was orderable. When I claimed my credit, the minimum order became 25.

The clock that gives you two opportunities never works ....TEMU always wins. Well, too bad cause I've never got the discount.... What are the credits for?? Just a game? In the past I picked 4 or 5 items, then they said, pick another one.....I did. NO CREDITS WHATSOEVER!!! You asked me, last week,  to add more details, I DID,  If not, you are going to delete my review in 10 days. Today Sunday, you told me I have only 2 days left ......

"Pros: sometimes the only way to get affordable consumer products in my country of sparse retail options and slow trade; free shipping and low prices; prompt refund was offered for damaged productsCons: Items shipped in thin bags with no packaging protection.  Many items were very poor quality, arrived broken or broke quickly afterward, do not match the impressions given by the photos.  Reviews are not sortable, and the star-rating is not a true average, but an algorithm-based scheme (which is detailed on the website).  You are only allowed one free return per package, so if you return a damaged item immediately, you will not be able to return an item that breaks later (the policy is unclear but you may be able to return it with your next order, however, I am unlikely to make another order based on the poor quality of my first.)",2,25/05/2023

"Yesterday I posted a bad review about Temu because I received an item that I had purchased and it was not at all what I expected so I tryed to return it and although I spent more than one hour trying to find the way to return the item all I was able to find was a page stating that I could return it but without any link or way to do so. I got very frustrated not because of the item but because of the fact that I wasn't able to find how to return it, even I tryed to contact them but couldn't find any place within the app to let me do that either.This morning I tryed again and I found immediately the page where I could do the return. So, to be fair I decided to re-write my review. My suggestion is for Temu to make it easier for the app users to find these places in case they are needed. I have purchased many items from Temu but this was the first time I needed to return one of them.",4,26/05/2023

"Honestly had really good experiences with customer service and quality of items. 95% of the items I get I am happy with, especially art supplies. The few that don?€?t meet my standards I have received instant refunds for. If you have issues with Fast Horse, you can also request they use a different carrier (for Australia they where kind enough to change to Aus Post as my parcels are sent to work and Fast Horse is problematic). Always read the reviews for products you buy, and within 10 days of purchase if the prices change you can apply for the refund of the difference which is automatic. Shipping is usually under 10 days. Very, very happy with Temu and the suppliers, it?€?s a lot better than AliExpress with the quality control and customer service.",5,26/05/2023

"First I was cautious. I was not sure if I should order anything off Temu, especially clothes. I tried it then with few very cheap items and I was so positively surprised that I kept ordering. By now I probably have placed 6 orders with all sorts of stuff and I`m absolutely amazed. The clothes are great quality and fit well, other things are exactly as described. Once I ordered several items but for one item (foam for fake flowers) it was supposed to be a pack of 6 but only 1 arrived. I claimed the other 5 as missing and not even an hour later I had a refund as credit on my Temu account (I chose the credit instead of getting the refund transferred to my bank account). Another time I ordered several items of which 5 were Capri leggings. I paid for the order but only after I saw photos in the item reviews that I did not like. I was able to cancel the unwanted items and again chose to get the refund to my Temu account. Super fast, no issues and the tracking information is brilliant too. I`m really grateful for Temu because I don't have that much money and also I`m a plus size and plus size clothing in my Country are really expensive and very boring, also not even better quality. Always the same colors and design. On Temu I finally find modern clothes that I actually like and can afford. Thank you, thank you, thank you Temu, you got a customer for life.",5,27/05/2023

"I am shocked at the negative feedback.I have ordered a lot of items since when I discovered It about 6 months ago. Everything has arrived ok, within the advertised time frame. I also liked the fact I can check on line where my parcel is in the delivery.Money wise, I have again had no issues. It sounds scary what some people have written, but I have had smooth transactions.I always check feedback carefully on any product I buy, which usually answers questions I have - eg if something is on larger or smaller side.",5,27/05/2023
"Have bought really good things from Temu, most looking far more expensive than the price paid. I ignore all the pop up bonus rubbish, because it?€?s not what it seems. Only gripe is orders take on average 8-10 days to arrive, but they come direct from China so to be expected. Temu recently announced delivery will in future be quicker, but although this hasn?€?t yet been the case, the tracking of orders is very detailed and informative.",4,27/05/2023

I have shopped on this website a few times some things are great such as little dog t shirts but it's hit and miss with the sizes. I found personally ladies clothes look good on site but aren't that great. Hit and miss with bits of household items they are just useless or just fall apart. Some items I've wanted to return they have refunded me without returning but to be honest they were no use to me I just gave what was okay to the charity shop or what wasn't okay I just binned. My really big gripe with this company you get emails saying that they are sorry and need to make up and 100% will be given back if you click and buy and if you click on the item a lamp for instance they say another item and then say you have 100% back but you have to spend a vast amount because it's given in small amounts when you spend over 50 pounds you get 10 pounds off then same again. I eventually blocked them on WhatsApp I was fed up with them saying how sorry and they're going to try harder. They do allow returns and when I have clicked on what I am returning back they try to encourage me to put it on temu and get it back straight away but I always ask for it back into my original payment method. Then a couple of weeks later I have so many breakages from the inferior products it's too late to wrap a item up and return it for the sake of a couple of pounds. Shop like a millionaire they claim to be honest in my opinion it's just tat that is waiting to be thrown away. UPDATE temu I have sent you proof who I am and my review is genuine so please don't deny like last time and ask trustpilot to take down my genuine honest review of my experience with you and the inferior shoddy goods that you sell. Not all your goods are inferior but 80% of them are in my personal opinion. I do review them fairly on your site but never seen the ones I give 1 star. You also rush me to pick things by saying what's in my basket has almost gone. You insist I spend ??15 each time for free delivery which is pretty fair but then to make up in my basket I add things I don't really want and that's when the rubbish gets added to my basket ???? so out of 9 items maybe four of them are useful and the rest turn out to be either broken or just no use at at all.,1,28/05/2023

Temu offered a ??70 voucher of the items in my cart that had been there a few days around ??159.00 I clicked on the voucher to see the discount and it completed an auto purchase without me touching another button. It also didn't apply the discount and took the money straight via my PayPal without me logging in and authorizing! Absolute cheat and con! I got straight onto the chat option and cancelled the complete order but it may take weeks to see the money returned. My opinion is be very careful this site is dangerous and can authorize payments without your consent!!,1,28/05/2023

"Good:  Excellent price for many items.  Reasonable shipping time and most orders arrived within the promised date range. Variety of items and categories.Bad:  Some items are not great in quality (however it's understandable as you get what you pay, low priced items low quality).  Shipping takes 2-3 weeks, if something is needed urgently, use Amazon.  Special offers (discounts, etc.) are useless because you can't use them on items you want, those offers can only applied to items that they chose to show which are usually items you already bought, or don't need.The ugly:  if you put items in your shopping cart and haven't checked out yet (waiting to add more items later), Temu randomly raised the price of items in your shopping cart WITHOUT notifying you, this is a very unethical business tactic.  If they raise the price of a items already in your cart, they should let you know that prices have changed and ask you to confirm if you still want them.  Raising by a small amount (50 cents to $2) without telling you, many people may not have noticed and end up paying higher price than what they original wanted to pay for.  This is an UNACCEPTABLE business practice, very UGLY.",3,29/05/2023
They list item as 925 silver when their not. It brass with plating on. Then when you contact customer service please return it. My point being they shouldn't list thing that aren't real silver. Disgusting. Also item get stuck at airport for 5 days and take ages to come avoid,1,29/05/2023
This is my first time ordering on Temu they send me a text that my delivery is placed on my door so I open my door to see there is nothing. Then I track my package and I see the picture of my package on my door but still there is nothing out side I was at home that day when I received the message and email i immediately opened my door but nothing there. Who ever delivered it didn?€?t place the package they just take a picture then take it with them. There is no way that package going to miss if they placed it . I always use online shopping never miss my package. The worst part is no one is responding when I call. Bad experience never going back to this App again :-(,1,29/05/2023

After an investigation  Temu  said that my package was correct and had been delivered. Therefore they closed my concern and told me there was no way I could get a refund or redelivery of my package now. In other words they are calling me a liar and a thief. I really wanted those plates. I have been with Temu for a long time and only twice they had to refund me. That was only because they lost my shipment. They said. You are only showing happy people.

Absolute useless. Bought items and they don?€?t even work. Trying to get refund is headache need contact bank stay away,1,29/05/2023
I a regular Temu costumers and their service are fantastic.  Only had to return one item so far and the was done so smoothly.   Can?€?t fault them.  WELL DONE,5,29/05/2023
Received a broken clock no refund. I ordered industrial pipes for shelves didn?€?t receive it and they refused a refund or to be resend another set. Very unhappy customer.,1,30/05/2023
"Nightmare, why can?€?t you just order one item? They have to keep pushing you for more and more, very frustrating and bombarded with spam since downloading the app ????",1,30/05/2023
Temu offers free shipping. What this means is anything up to just short of two weeks (i.e. 9 working days)!! I have to presume they aren't paying a delivery service but cycling orders around the country themselves...? Bizarre.,2,30/05/2023
"I downloaded the app for ""free"" products for first time users. Long story short, they wanted me to pay $42 for the free stuff. App delete of course",1,30/05/2023

"I ordered 1st time 3 weeks ago and, as of 1st time buyer, I had 90% on everything I bought(4 items) Then, they ask me to chose 3 gifts(100% free)in the same range of price that I just bought. About one week passed and I received my order...Everything is as seen on screen. Thank you ""TEMU""",5,30/05/2023
"Temu free gifts were close to impossible to achieve. Its a click base time consuming process. Deceiving! First family who accept invite for new app will give you 50 cents credit. 2nd family member invite will give you 30 cents credit. 3rd family member invite gives you 10 cents credit . The 4th family member invite only gives you 3 cents credit.The 5th New app user invite gives you 1cent credit,  the 6th new app invites gives you 1 cent credit,  the 7th new app invited gives you 1 cent credit and 3 of friends that already used temu gives you $0 credit even though those friends purchase again from temu...so making the tab to $0 balance is close to impossible and the clock is running out of time. Time consuming process and very deceiving...false hope, false promises .False marketing .It's not free gift but high pressure click base impossible to complete the task on time no matter how many  more you invite. At the end no free gift just lots of time got wasted after trying so hard. BEWARE.",1,30/05/2023
"I started shopping from Temu over a year ago, and every thing was going well. After that, the orders began to be delayed, and the carrier ( Supai express ) didn't deliver the package on time mean while I was  notified that the package was delivered. They promised me that this would not happen again. It was supposed to receive the order last Thursday 2 May 2024,next day Friday when I check the messages I read that the order was delivered on Friday May,3, 12:41 am by Emile carrier. When I inquired from Temu, their response was to wait 1-3 days until I get the response. After one day they offered me a $20 coupon as expressing their regret, but I didn't accept it because I was sure it was as a trap. Today I received  an email  by Temu informing me that the Emile carrier has delivered the background and I must check here and there and they are sorry for that so FUNNY.   (( The problem has been settled by Temu ))",1,30/05/2023
"I gotta say, I've never done as much online shopping as after I downloaded Temu for my phone a few months ago; and a few months and MANY orders later I am still not disappointed. There is so much great stuff to amazing prizes. Everything I've bought has been of pretty good quality considered what I paid. Highly recommend.",5,30/05/2023
I am sad that the order price has risen from $15 to $35. Sorry too much for nothing.,3,30/05/2023
"Temu never disappointed me and I ordered again and their discount is unbelievable and the tax is reasonable, big up Temu.",5,30/05/2023
Can get great deals for good prices you can get thongs for free some times this app has changed the way I shop 5/5??????,5,30/05/2023
Was fine while it lasted if they had better choices in delivery services they would have 5 stars everywhere but other then auspost I?€?m not receiving my packages. Special thank to imile for scamming me out of $160 of product. And with there new refund system they believe the courier with no proof of delivery Over you. Not to forget that my minimum cost to actually order something is now $65. So I?€?m meant to spend over $65 just to be scammed. Wonderful,2,30/05/2023
My receent purchase all the products are sent to us was the worst quality. Made of plastic. Never ever we will purchase from Temu again,1,30/05/2023
"I've been playing the game farmland for 9 months. It may be even longer. The game is a scam. I've been trying to get 5 cents for at least 2 months. Don't waste your time. There's less than 20   hours of the game left and I still need 5 cents. After all the money I spent, I could have just purchased the items that I chose for the free gifts. I'm very disappointed. Again don't waste your time!",1,30/05/2023
"In general this site has exceeded my expectations.  Like many, I was wary about buying from China.  However I've purchased from them many times and I'm really impressed with the quality of the products.  The clothes are not high end, but for everyday wear the quality is good.  Sizing is a bit weird - I've never worn XL, but their XL is US12.  Returns are easy and free.  The only reason for the 3-star rating is their ""coupons"" and ""special offers""  feel a bit like a scam.  I'd purchased many times, so was told I would get 10 free gifts.  Spent my valuable time selecting gifts, then when 10 selected, I'm told I have 9 approved but need to ask friends to try Temu in order to get 10th.  In fact I get only one gift - the cheapest one I selected.  After sending invites to several friends, I gave up.  They should have told me up front that this was a requirement!  Super annoying.  And on and on it goes.  How the heck many friends do I have to invite?  Don't waste my time!  Very annoying for a customer who's spent a lot of money with Temu.",3,30/05/2023
"They have minimums so if you want an item, you are forced to buy more. Also,$15 min to even place an order. They say they will give you $5 automatically if item doesn't arrive on date they say.  Nope, you have to call in and they have 24 hrs to approve it.  They usually do but they are condescending about it all the way. Their cust. srvc is horrible. If you receive a clearly damaged item, start a return, provide clear pics & it is rejected by the seller, you are out of luck unless you ship the item back AT YOUR EXPENSE, which costs more than the item. Any response from Temu is worthless. Only want $$$5/5/24 update:  If customer service was your upmost concern, you would have listened to me when I showed you pics of damaged items.  Instead the only recourse you said that I had was to return the items at my expense and one approved  I would then get a refund.  Unbelievable.   I can't provide order numbers because I closed my account.",1,30/05/2023
"The delivery was faster than expected so I?€?m really pleased about that but to order from Temu, there was a ??10 minimum spend. It?€?s gone up to ??15 now if I want to order again. I bought 5 pairs of socks which are not the best quality, I also bought a tray with 4 compartments for snacks and I love that! I bought a daisy keyring which was better quality than I expected. A ring which was too big for me and a storage box which was also too big but that?€?s my fault for not measuring the size. Overall my experience was okay. I think there are some good products in this shop. Temu is legit.",4,30/05/2023
"Ordered and paid for products on Temu, now I get an email from Temu/ Allportcargo services stating that I need to pay local taxes. The email comes with a link that asks for your bank username and password, there is no way I would share that infromation, so now I am stuck with no product and cannot get a refund. Temu is a scam!!!!",1,30/05/2023
I've been ordering from Temu for obverse 2 years with the same address as well as same debit card and out of the blue sky's I ordered a bulk of items totaling about 200.00 all of a sudden they suspect unusual activities on my account which I didn't report anything and I've been shopping 2 years same debit so I was completely lost and surprised so I sent in numerous screenshots of last four digits of my card as well as my account statement sheets showing I've been ordering well they can't read absolutely not one of them I sent 20. So with the non resolution to the problem I just asked to be deleted permanently because this is idiotic remind you I have 4 other orders right now out for delivery same debit card purchases so I just was completely fed up with all the games you continuously play and Never get the Free items they want you to keep inviting people that clearly won't sign up because it's False Advertising they have All Types Of Ridiculous  Behind Games with no winnings to prevail and orders take way too long omg they can't communicate and none knowledgeable on how to proceed with Real Resolutions  don't waste your time with them pictures are sometime fake and wrong thrifty made items are shipped  you DO NOT GET NEW USER 200$ COUPON IT REQUIRES A WHOLE LOTTA BULLCRAP THAT YOURE NEVER GETTING,1,30/05/2023
"Terrible company there items have gone up an lot in price and most of the stuff is useless rubbish. They have people playing games for prizes then just stop the game so all the customers lose out and offered  an lousy 20% off voucher, they have started selling awful clothes.

"Over all I do rate temu, iv had some great products at really good prices. This would be a 5 star review if it wasn't for this... I did the ""100% cash back"" offer, meaning soend ??50 and get ??50 back, this isn't what it seems at first. The ??50 ypu get back is a con, it's ??10 off when you spend ??100 and 2x??20 of when you spend ??200. So yeah, that is totally not how it's sold to you. Bit of a poor deal if I'm honest, it's just a 10% of your next order when you spend those amounts of money. Not happy.",3,31/05/2023
I regularly shop at Temu. Highly recommend. Received loads of great stuff at brilliant prices. Love it!,5,31/05/2023
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Temu. I have had nothing but excellent service. I have made approximately 30 purchases with them. Returns are super easy and occasionally they will say to keep the product and they still credit my account. It?€?s true, not allItems are top notch quality, but that?€?s why we shop at Temu. Some items are amazing and others are average.  But more often than not, I love the dresss, pants, jackets, vests, purses, workout clothes are great!!!

"They don't follow the law, the must return the payment via MasterCard Clearpay etc, not, as they feel Temu credit. Order pickers awful, quality worst I've seen. Oh and USA found in 2023 they were using Ughars illegally. Make out their in Dublin but worst of the Chinese companies. As per contacting them, I spent 12 hours trying to sort their errors out. All truthful & screenshot. I mean who orders 6 pairs of jeans!! Please note their response. It's their fault and they want you to resolve it. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They lie and refuse to refund the way you paid IE MasterCard and give you a Temu credit note Still all their fault, who the hell orders 5 pairs of identical jeans, 4 pairs of PVC jeans etc etc.The parcel I flatly refused to collect I have received a full review on MasterCard. Be interesting to see if it does go through and isn't altered with today. There's also approximately 4 more parcels all wrapped together as they couldn't issue the separate returns. Even though I have screenshots of them telling me to do this. I await the approximate ??400-500 refund on Clearpay/MasterCard then never want to hear from this illegal company. You have to faff about removing them as there is verified spyware installed on their app & deleting the app doesn't removed spyware.The UK/Dublin should ban this company immediately",1,31/05/2023
"Had made an order and it was delivered in a damaged parcel and had a missing item, i contacted Temu about this and applied for a refund, they said they reviewed it and said that there was nothing they could do and didn't issue me a refund. I've paid ??20 for nothing basically.",1,31/05/2023
"hi, I ordered from Temo.com Order # PO-211-1402--------------2632 on March 27th, 2024 for over $150, on Temu.com orders over $129.00 get expedited shipping. When I checked my order I saw they did not offer me expedited shipping, so I called them to cancel the order because I needed the order sooner they told me they were going to cancel the order but in fact, they did not cancel the order, and still charged my card, so I went and I dispute the charge with my credit card issuer. they sent out the order and was delivered, I returned the items on 4/9/2034 to Temu. As of today May 2nd, 2024, I did not receive a refund because they are claiming that the dispute is still open. I sent them a letter that I closed the dispute on May 8th with the credit card issuer, I emailed them and called multiple times but they are unwilling to give me any refund. they are claiming I'm still disputing the charge, I offered them American Express's direct number for disputes, and I emailed them all the letters that I received from American Express. stating that the dispute is closed in their favor. still no refunds for over 24 days!",1,31/05/2023
They advertise with 100$-ish coupon and then when downloading the app a lot of requirements apply so I basically have to spend much more than I get off. Also they take all your data cuz Chinese company.,1,31/05/2023
"Temu got my return order and denied me a refund saying they didn't get it.... they are so weird...they got it and didn't get it.... no sense, anyway steer clear or returning anything... many of the products are not as they appear eithet",1,31/05/2023
I love Temu it so awesome and exciting very great,5,31/05/2023
I do regularly order from temu but i have lost faith after not receiving some of my items and got accused of lying basically. They eventually refunded me so i could reorder the items i didnt get 1st time.Update after they investigated again i got a full refund n now have reordered,3,31/05/2023
First time I have bought an item and with no problem at check out then I saw the option to add more items after I payed and after receiving confirmation soon thought good idea! and I did want more items to include but then they were telling me to buy a minimum of ??15 like I was buying separately when the idea was to pay all together!!! The website is all over the place and I wasted more than 30 min trying to figure it out the problem but with no success then I realised I included a wrong item and I cancelled it and they said I will be refunded but how come if I haven?€?t paid the added items because they didn?€?t allow me until I get to ??15 ? So I gave up and I don?€?t want to buy anymore on this company. Hopefully my first order will get to me with no delay and won?€?t have any other complaint.,3,31/05/2023
"I have never received a refund for missing items. Temu started well but is getting worse and worse. Not only the rubbish items are getting more and more expensive and items are missing from each order and  they  are all mixed up from different orders so if you have already returned some items you received earlier and the items from the same order come later  Temu charges you  to return them even though it is entirely their fault  that they  were not  delivered together.  Now they also refuse to pay for missing items. I had several items missing from all my orders before and I only kept using Temu becasue I always received a refund. No more though! As with everything else Temu has gone worse here too and has just told me that I will not get a  refund for the missing items as  they believe that the items were packed.  Rubbish stuff and rubbish way of treating the customers. Update: In response to my review Temu wants the order number. Here it is together with their response to my complaint regarding missing items:'Refund deniedAfter verifying with our warehouse, we've confirmed that your items were indeed packaged and shipped to you. Your package was also shipped in good condition.Order ID:PO-210-10893649034870333'",1,31/05/2023
I have been shopping on Temu for a few months now and have bought a lot of variety and have spent way more than I should just from sheer volume. Once I understood the sizing charts and fabrics I had more success with clothes. Overall I was very happy with my purchases and always left honest reviews. Shipping has been good and returns no hassle. Any shipping that was a day or two late I received a $5 refund automatically and the product arrived shortly after. Thus far I have had no problems with customer service and most products are good. Read the descriptions very well and know your measurements and fabrics. Beware it can be addictive :),5,31/05/2023
"Constant dumb games and fake ""credits"" that don't lead to any kind of discount at all.  First you are led to believe that you won something, but then they dangle the carrot until you make five more orders with no reward at all.  It's tacky and their products fall apart easily.  Don't buy an office chair from them if you want an actual back rest that won't break.   Customer service is useless in this matter, completely indifferent that their scamware is misleading and dishonest.  Apparently you have to spend over $100 on crap that you don't want in order to get $90 in credits that never come.",1,31/05/2023

"I am a regular Temu customer. They are really great in every possible way. They really do go the extra mile and get everything right.

Keep up the great work.",5,31/05/2023
"I ordered a dress i really liked for my hols.Luckily paid via Paypal. Had messages saying shipped, in transit, should receive soon,  even gave a date. Weeks later  a message stating out of stock ? dress still advertised on Temu web site. PayPal refunded me promptly.  Also was offered a free gift of sandals. They arrived but I was charged ??10. Raised with PayPal and was refunded. Will think twice before ordering anything else from them.",2,31/05/2023
"Overall quite happy with the delivery and price. Very surprised aswell. Quality isn't always great. A couple of times I've recieved an item that broken or damaged but so far I've had alot of success. I've orded heaps of stuff for gifts for loved ones and friends and fun things for myself. I was remodelling a bedroom and ordered lots of items that turned out great and are functional, like fairy lights, curtain clips and cuddly toys that are very soft and cute. On my most recent order I recieved a stuffed goose for my sons birthday and it had a large hole in it. I very soon after contacting temu I was very pleased with the fast service and quick response. I was given a refund and that was enough for me to be satisfied. I would recommend this app and my only major sticking point us the spam I get in my inbox. Other than that. I'm very satisfied.",4,31/05/2023

And because I won't as I don't travel well because of my illnesses they are accusing me of asking for a full refund for free.I a asking for ASSISTANCE AND REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT DUE TO DISABILITY. NOT A FREE REFUND. I have now tried to explain this to 3 advisors who gave been the same unhelpful and prejudiced and the third refused me a manager and refused me a formal complaint.

"""Free Delivery Special for You"" written at the top of their website, and on every item page I've seen. It's only when you get to checkout that it states it requires a minimum order. Of course, this is not unreasonable by any means. I just object to being misled. Website needs to be more transparent. I've only used Temu once before with free delivery for a cheap single item with no issues. So I expected the same as the signs indicated so, until I got to checkout. I hope they'll be no issues with my orders. I do appreciate their very good prices but lack of transparency always makes me suspicious.",3,01/06/2023

Very strange company. They process orders like no other company I have experienced. I have tried to order several times and the mayor part of the orders are handeled correctly but they chose to refound parts of the orders with the argument that the adress is not valid. So hove come they can deliver some of the items but not others. The helpdesk are completletly incapable of dealing with this issue. They do answer very quickly but they do not have the will or capability to solve the issue. If you value time and patience shop elsevere!After having posted the above described situation I recieve an automated answer informing me that there is no probleme returning ordered items!!!  Well... if they refound the part of the order that they can not deliver there is nothing to return. Once again a proof that they most likely do not read your what you write to them. Automated answer that does not fit into the situation makes it just look like a joke.5 days after last update: Well well... The story continously improves through the funny path. Another autogenerated answer was produced - exactly the same as first time telling me how sorry they are not capable of satisfying me as a coustumer. Informing me how to proceed with any kind of reclamation or returning of damaged goods. No explanaition what so ever to my question why they can deliver some items in the same order and not others that they claim having an unvalid adress. I have made 3 orders and every time I try to include some LI-IO batteries they refound them informing me that the adress indicated is not valid. Maybe they should try to actually understand the issue before returning a autogenerated answer.,1,01/06/2023

I received 100% discount when I pinned the wheel. Chose my items and the system wants payment. This happened last night 30 April 2024,1,02/06/2023
"What a farce. Returned 6 items for credit.Temu acknowledged receipt at post office and now claim nothing arrived expect one unidentified object which is completely impossible. So 100 Euros out of pocket and no goods to show for it. All the fine words are pretty empty,they won't be getting any more money from me",1,02/06/2023
"Very very slow shipping, takes much longer than estimated for order to arrive and customer service is poor. *Changes the delivery estimate time to prevent paying the ??4 for overdue orders*Orders sit for days at a time with no activity*App will apologise for delays but when you contact customer service they'll deny there's a problem*Goods show as in stock but a few days later change to pre-order*App shows bizarre statistics like 79.6% of orders delivered in less than 7 days. Which aren't true.",1,02/06/2023
"I have ordered from Temu multiple times . Initially the whole process was good and simple. Lately 2 times i have had a horrible experience with their courier partners. First time - the parcel did not come for 3 weeks. Then after the delivery time had long passed one day I suddenly get a notification that they are delivering my package - that too on a Sunday. Since the address i had given was office addres ( so that there is a concierge desk) it was clsoed and the parcel was returned. when asked for re -delivery attempt i was told 3-4 business days which would have taken it to the weekend again and the same thing would have happened. Finally i had ot track their ware house - 15 kms away and go and collect the parcel myself which is not how it should be .All this while i was trying to establish the contact the courier directly myself as Temu was of no help .The second time it was a working day we were all working in the office and still I get a notification that the driver could not find a safe place for the parcel and so the delivery is returned. How did they not come in , find the concierge to contact me before saying they cannot deliver? Terrible customer service as there is absolutely no help from Temu where bolts answer your questions with standard template answers",2,02/06/2023
"I ordered some open home signs, 3 that you stick in the ground and one flag. The flag was shown in the advertising photo with a stand. When the parcel arrived, the flag had no pole or stand. When I enquired about it I was told it didn't come with the stand or pole.   This is not very satisfactory, and I feel was false advertising. I was offered a discount off my next purchase, which was no use to me as my open home was this weekend. The advertising did not stipulate that it didn't come with the stand or pole. however, I was happy with the rest of my purchase.",1,02/06/2023
"Everything was great until I asked for a refund.   I?€?ve been shopping on Temu for over a year and have spent close to $3,000.I haven?€?t had any issues, if something I ordered had an issue, they always made it right, by issuing a credit or replacing the item.  I was expecting a package to be delivered by UPS last weekend but it never came.  UPS confirmed they lost the package and instructed me to file a claim, which I did.  UPS processed my claim immediately and notified Temu that the package was lost.  I figured Temu would issue a refund for the $100 - nope.  They told me I had to wait to see if the package showed up.  I asked to speak to manager, so now I?€?m being told to check back in 24 hours.  We?€?ll see if I get my money back.",2,02/06/2023

Yes you do get what you pay for but you can get your money back. Do not play Fishland it?€?s a real con. I was so close to getting my free gifts and it re set itself back to the beginning and the time wasn?€?t even up on the countdown. You won?€?t get anything for free. They squash your delivery into a tiny package so things get squashed, bent or anything plastic is normally cracked. The socks are really nice, I have quite a few pairs.",3,02/06/2023

I printed out a label and took parcel to the post office. Lady there said it couldn't be scanned. I thought perhaps there was something wrong with their equipment. Went to a 2nd post office same thing happened. Called temu. They said a problem with their labels but was OK now. Really? On 23rd April I was informed I didn't need to send sandals back and that I'd receive a refund .I'm still waiting for said refund which hasn't materialised!They offered to put a ??5 credit on my account..I said I didn't want it as I was closing my account...they ignored this and added a 5.00 credit to my account.

"Editing to add into this that at every step Temu have insisted that as soon as Evri receive the parcel I MUST contact them and ask them to return the parcels BEFORE I can have my refund. EVRI DO NOT DO RETURNS FOR TEMU! Temu just try to force you to accept their products. If I could give them ZERO, I would. They appear really good up-front, until you try using their misleading coupons, and realise you're not getting anything without spending a small fortune for it. Then they tell you that the multiple orders you just did to get the discounts that were not applied, or vouchers that you can't afford to use now, are not being sent all in one go as they claimed they would be. They tell you delivery is free, but it turns out everything is going to take forever to be sent. Make no mistake here, they'll tell you it's 'shipped', whilst it sits for four days doing nothing, and Evri tells you they're 'expecting it', but in reality it's all still in another country, but you have no clue where. Their staff claim they're sorry, understand how you feel, and will offer a 20% voucher you have to use before the sun sets. You spend hours with damaged hands trying to use the chat screen, tell them how painful it is, and never once do they tell you there is a call back service! When you do request a call back it's like trying to get past the Dr's receptionist first to get one. When they call they just lie, patronise you, and try telling you that Evri will sort it all out for you on their website. You know, that totally useless bot we all hate with a passion that does absolutely nothing? That's Temu's problem solver, as they lie about being the only company in the world that can't contact Evri themselves. When you've finally had enough of the lies, and request a refund, they say no. Excuse me? You lied, my items were not shipped, your treatment of me is disgusting, and I want my money back. Their solution? I must wait until the parcels show up in the Evri system, contact Evri... yes, that thing that is impossible for us to do... and tell them to return the parcels, and wait for some impossible date in the future for my money back. Instead, they could just contact the company themselves, and give me my money back now, because I have zero trust of this happening in the future.Alternatively, treat your customers better, so that we actually want to be customers. I really don't, and I've contacted Paypal to lodge a complaint with them too.",1,03/06/2023
"Bad temu ???? first they make games that are impossible to finish, most reviews are definitely fake, now they are removing farmland game just in the UK which is discrimination.. so UK are left with getting overpriced items which are just as cheap on Amazon, no perks for long time users, and it's just about sharing their link... So why are you discriminating the UK????? Other countries have much more on the app so why not do the extra stuff for the UK?

Suspicious to start with app so used web to buy. I've been using and ordering online and I've only got excellent results.

Can only recommend as buying and price have been good with delivery through Evri great.,5,03/06/2023
"TEMU is basically not a bad company to deal with. You get what you pay for. The majority of my purchases are for craft items (cardmaking) and have to say every thing has been as described and does it's job well. Regarding clothes the material is not explained in description. Children's toys I have found not strong enough So will not buy any more.Read description carefully and dimensions, do not be deceived by photos of the product if it is shown in the hand look carefully and you will see that it is a child's hand. It is a bit frustrating that questions Cannot be asked about the product. There is no doubt some products are deliberately misleading but I think TEMU are weeding these suppliers out.Their delivery I have found to be excellent and packaging has improved.Any query or complaint about a product has been dealt with efficiently and courteously.They do try to rush you into buying and their discounts and coupons make you 'think' you are getting a bargain. Just buy what you need and don't be sucked into their selling techniques. Their review ratings, including poor ones, are now much easier to locateIn the last 12 months I have seen improvements on the site so it is constantly evolving and believe it is getting better to Navigate and be aware of what is a bargain and what is notFor my needs TEMU is brilliant and will continue to be a customer, the money I am saving on products allows me to enjoy my hobby with a clear conscience",4,03/06/2023
Ordered loads from Temu.  Was sceptical at first but they are excellent and customer service and shipping is fast.  Their goods have all been as described so far.  Thanks Temu.,5,03/06/2023
"First and foremost, I am addicted to Temu. I love everything about them. I actually can afford their stuff. Maybe not everything is top notch, but it's not anything bad to have. I have bought from clothes, electronics, moisturizers, different bags...you name it I have either bought it or won paplaying their games Fishland and Farmland. Those games, I have won amazing things. I have won 7 prizes, first prize was 50 bucks worth of makeup! I have ordered 31 times, out of those times I had 2 problems that were simply fixed. When you don't receive an order in time, the courier has a certain time limit to deliver your package to you. If it doesn't get there in time, Temu will credit your account $5.00 per package. Even if it's the same order, you will get credited each package if they were sent separately. After that, Temu gives another couple of weeks or so and they will credit your acct the whole amount or you can reorder. If you end up receiving your package after all, you keep the stuff for free. I'm not sure about other countries but in the US, Temu uses a few couriers. The ones I know of are:USPS - your mailman/womanUPSOntrac The couriers that I would like to deliver my stuff is Ontrac but unfortunately you can't request this. Believe me! I have tried. UPS sucks most of the time and they almost always won't have your package delivered to you on time. USPS, they have their quirks too just not as bad.  Honestly if you are on disability like me, it is certainly worth shopping at Temu. They have everything you need or want. Also, customer service is awesome if you ever need to talk with them. Anyways I hope this post will help you  and I really hope you enjoy Temu as much as I do!!! ????",5,03/06/2023
I agree with what?€?s already been said about the very poor quality but occasionally you can find a real good quality bargain. But unfortunately I spent a lot to find that one bargain so it probably ended up being quite expensive in the long run. Also it?€?s a site that you keep popping things in your basket because of how cheap they are then ending up with a load of gadgets at home you never use. My friend and I laugh at what we?€?ve ordered as it?€?s always a surprise when it arrives. I?€?m deleting the app as it becomes an addiction buying all those cheap things that you?€?d never buy if you saw them in a shop.,2,03/06/2023

I spent ??10.26 in total (free postage) Order included a men's wallet, various pieces of mens jewellery and a men's coat RRP. ??56. I knew it was coming from China. I ordered seven days before Xmas. I was impressed with communications, Temu sent me regular email up dates informing me as to my parcels status. Parcel was delivered ten days after purchase, which considering this was Xmas period, I thought was pretty good. The products were all pretty much as I expected, the coat fairly obviously wasn't the ??56 value designer coat advertised but is still a fairly decent coat. My experience was pretty positive. People are complaining about Temu, saying poor ethics, poor staff wellbeing, deliberately trying to take over the market and push Amazon out etc. Tbh if there are competing with Amazon then good as Amazon is an awful company. Also show me any western large retailer that hasn't got some dubious practices. I would rate Temu better than Amazon.",4,05/06/2023

If and I mean IF you can receive what you ordered then you've struck gold. This company has so many orders coming and going that I believe they've lost track of who has what. My advice is to call them up and explain you're situation. They will attempt to correct any errors on their part. Honestly they are a good company that is trying to perfect their name. Give them a try. The prices are terrific IF you can get the item ordered before the price goes up. I'll give them my business. They deserve it.,4,05/06/2023

MY ADVICE PAY EXTRA AND GO TO AMAZON BECAUSE TEMU  LOVES TO KEEP YOUR MONEY FOR LOST/ STOLEN PACKAGES , EVIRI HELPS THEM DO THIS , As once they issue a deliver code , you are up the creek without a paddle , if items missing !TEMU IS UNREGULATED AND AS SUCH CAN SHARE YOUR INFORMATION SO BE WARN.  WANT IT CHEAP MIGHT COST U DEAR .SEE SAME RUBBISH REPLY AND HEY TEMU SEE THE ALREADY 16 MESSAGES IN TEMU CHAT 7 PHOTOS 4 EMAILS THIS PROVES THEY DO NOT CARE AS PROPERLY RUN COMPANY WOULD NOT PUT SUCH STUPID REPLIES AS THEY CLEARLY THINK I GOT RE COMPLAIN WHEN ITS ALREADY BEEN DONE  THANKS TEMU RIP ME OFF MY MONEY NOT !",1,05/06/2023
I love temu everything I've have bought has been good quality when I bought a couple of things that didn't fit was so easy to return and they gave me my refund before they even received the goods back brilliant customer  service highly recommended,5,05/06/2023
I love  shopping  with temu.my only problem  is after I place an order and later go back to place another  order  it will say that they can't process  the order with my card to use another card. But after 2 or 3 days when I order with the same card my order goes through. As soon as I'm ready to place another  order the same thing happens  all over again  this is the only reason  that I will not be ordering  anything  anymore,3,05/06/2023
Another Chinese scam site. Offered 87% discount and free postage. At checkout the total price had $1390 added to it and ?€?discounted?€? to the full price for all items with a total of $430. How they got $1390 from a full price of $430 is beyond me. Be very very careful about the check out scam,1,05/06/2023

"It took me a little while to shop at temu but I'm glad I did. I first bought arts and crafts materials, just to test it out. No issues with delivery and the items were fine. Now, I regularly buy things there, like stationery, garden equipment or household items. So far, all my purchases have been great, with items of expected quality or higher. There were a couple of issues with delivery (wrong address). I don't know how, but both times the issue was resolved quickly, after contacting customer service.A lot of these products are exactly the same as on other buy/sell places, but at a lower price (apparently because you buy straight from the producer, not the supplier, so it's not resale). I'll happily continue exploring what temu has to offer.",5,05/06/2023
"I have to admit Temu is an addiction , things start of cheap, for good reason , they are cheap ! Which I accept . Some of the things on there though are really good ( I won?€?t say which ) Here is the bad thing about Temu , they pester you with pretend offers that are impossible to collect , 100% back ! That?€?s free right ? Wrong !They also have a time limited shop so you have a certain time to buy up , pay up and sucker it up.This tactic reminds me of the old open market flimflam sales ?€? I?€?m not asking ??5 , I?€?m not asking ??3 ! No Ladies and Gentlemen for just 99p all this can be yours but I only have ?€??€?. You know the type if you are of a certain age Yes you guessed it Temu is run by Delboy Look you have a minimum buy of ??15 and the amount of stuff you buy for that is ok but it?€?s like crack to a drug addict .The amount of emails with these bogus offers gets worse and worse . Eventually this will go one of two ways . They will either grow so large they will become a genuine healthy business or they will be shut down as a scam company . Let?€?s wait and see if they last as Temu or have a name change ?",3,05/06/2023
"Still waiting on delivery guaranteed to be delivered latest 24th Nothing it is the 26th, get in touch with the delivery  service and then they say another 2 to 4 days business days, So as I ordered things for a vacation and leave very early Monday, Very disappointed, won't be ordering again",1,05/06/2023
When first using Temu I was excited about it I received some really great items at great prices now if you want a specific item you have to spend ??15 before you can even place your order  which really bucks up the price of the item you want for instance ladies sandals ??5.25 but I have to add ??15 worth of stuff I don't need or want before I can order the sandals so now the great deal I thought I was getting is now costing me 3 times as much as the original price    it's a con even with free shipping they are going to lose alot of customers by making their minimum order ??15 I won't be using Temu again and a few of my friends have also opted out from this app we will be shopping on shein from now on at least they only charge ??3 delivery with no minimum order the packaging is a lame excuse Temu you deserve to lose customers,2,05/06/2023
I have stopped with Tempu!  There must be no communication between ordering and shipping. I am fed up! I order 1 item and over the span of a week or so  I recieve 4 of the same thing over and over again. Get it right! I am done with this site!,2,05/06/2023
Ordered one pair of slippers.    JUST ONE  PAIR,5,06/06/2023
I have bought so many things from  Temu. So far I didnt have any issues with delivery or return. They are very quick to response for  enquiries and refunds. I find Temu is very reliable and professional comparing to many other online retailers. At the begging i was not sure but now I am very confident with this company. Had no issues with payments.,5,06/06/2023

Customer service is really GREAT Ndur txting a humantbat dont txt 2u like an idiot. And understand wat ur talking about  Im very happy 2 shop with them again.Well the deliveryservice is SOOOOO bad that u cant talk 2 anyone. Its time TEMU looked into their delivery service has anyone been able 2 download their web site. Www evir.com/,5,06/06/2023
"I have ordered so, so, so sooo much stuff from Temu. I've found that most problems were delivery issues with the shipping companies. Even so, Temu resolved the issues by doing whatever was necessary to make me whole, from reissuing my order to refunding my money. I have NEVER had a problem and for the most part, I have been pleased with products/service.  The products sold vary in quality, based on the vendor. You have to do your due diligence when ordering from any online store/platform.",5,06/06/2023
"I've been using the Temu shopping app for a while now, and overall, it's been pretty good experience so far! Shopping is pretty easy, and the prices are great. One thing that stands out is how user-friendly the app is. Whether you're looking for essentials or looking for more random stuff to have around the house, finding what you want is easy.The only downside, if I had to pick one, is that sometimes the delivery can take a bit longer than expected. But hey, all good things comes to those who wait, right? And it's not a deal-breaker by any means.Overall, I'd give Temu a solid four stars. It's become a good place to shopping online, and I'd definitely recommend giving it a try!!",4,06/06/2023

"I don't even want to give this one star. Temu is asking the customer to bare the logistic failures and refusing to refund the amount. I didn't receive the whole package and i inquired with the customer service, that is complete waste of time because they are keeping on sending template message which is really annoying. It is a big amount and they are saying logistics as a reason. I would suggest people to use secured platforms and platform who will respect customer and their satisfaction.",1,06/06/2023
"I had the worst experience with Temu customer service yesterday. I purchased a keyless entry lock the other day, but I found the same lock that is a lot cheaper. I went to the customer service to ask whether I can get a price adjustment for it. The agent said I could, and showed me the price adjustment eligibility requirements. I was eligible for a price adjustment. He asked me to send him screen shots, and I did everything as he asked. He worked on everything very slow?€? and I asked him many times whether he was still there. Finally, when he was ready to do it, he told me he couldn?€?t do it anymore, because the product is unavailable. Then he told me, I am not eligible for it because the product was not from the same store. The price adjustment eligibility clearly states that it can be from the other stores!!! He had the nerve to send me a revise price adjustment statement later, stating only from the same seller. I sent him back the first statement, and called out on him. He didn?€?t talk to me and left, and another agent took over. The agent took over said he had created a ticket for me. The next day I received a message saying the price adjustment is approved. Then a day later, I received a $1 refund. I thought it was a joke and mockery, I messaged them back, and asked them to show me the math. Someone responded me, and telling the how to get to the $1 refund. They deducted all my coupons before doing the price adjustment!!!! Who with a brain would do such a thing? Whatever the price is shown in the market, that?€?s the price, no matter what kind of coupons I have.  Errrr?€? It?€?s so irritating. And I have the worst luck with the farmland games. My friends?€? games have a lot of water, and activities. Mine is laughable. It?€?s been 8 months?€?. No matter how you invite friends, spend money or being on it every day. You won?€?t win it. It?€?s a pure unfair game. No matter how I showed them the unfairness and evidence of this game comparing to my friends. They didn?€?t care! Temu is such a disappointment!!!",1,06/06/2023

"I ordered a number of items, one of which was defective. I took photos of the defective item that cost $2, fully expecting an immediate acceptance of my refund request. No. After two hours of chat time Temu still refused to issue a refund without me returning the product, which would have required me to walk an hour away to a shipper. Again, for a $2 defective product. Please shop at AliExpress. They are reliable, trustworthy and professional.",1,06/06/2023

"I received my package from Temu today with a hole in the bag. This is my first time experiencing this after ordering from them. The delivery person took a picture of the hole in my package, as well as my own photo of it. Upon opening the package, I noticed several missing items. I noticed my package was poorly packed, with all my stickers bent. I called and reported the missing items, but I have to wait 48 hours for a resolution. I know it's out of Temu's hands once my items had shipped, but it's still frustrating that we can't seem to trust anyone with our packages anymore. Temu, please look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible.",3,06/06/2023
I?€?m not paying for an order over $40 dollars worth of stuff off your site. I ordered once had no problem. Go to order again they want an order over $25. Now it?€?s over $40 so yeah see ya later. I?€?ll go back to Ali where I can get free shipping on orders under $5,1,06/06/2023
I have ordered a few times. I am happy with my products. What bothers me is the when I order and receive my packages through BUFFALO or FAST WAY couriers we pay about 15% import duties.  When they are delivered by ALLPORT or iMILE I land up paying about 40%. I can't see if you can choose a courier.  This will stop me from ordering again,3,06/06/2023
"I?€?ve now ordered about five times from Temu. I?€?ve bought approx six men?€?s shirts, some shorts, underwear, bracelets, hanging signs, cat toys, etc.The quality of many of the items is good - but the sizing is waaaay out. I?€?m a 46?€? chest - so ordered appropriately. More often than not, the items are much too big for me. The size charts cannot be trusted. They are sending the size that I order but it?€?s too big. Then, another shirt will arrive (using same Temu chart measurements) and it fits great. I won?€?t be ordering shirts from them again. Also, some of the deliveries take much longer than they say - so BEWARE and give yourself plenty of lead time if you?€?re going on holiday and buying items for your trip - mine didn?€?t turn up in time. Very annoying.",3,06/06/2023
"I?€?d give it 0 stars if I could. I ordered 6 things from Temu, I decided to send 5 items back 4 of them were too flimsy or poor quality for what I needed them for and the other item I sent it back because I ordered 2. I sent them back through the postoffice. Waiting shortly after for my refund to be told by Temu my refund was denied because I either sent back the items with barcodes missing or the items were missing. I filed a claim and they still denied me. I had proof of postage, that still wasn?€?t enough. This is the second time temu have denied me a refund because my stuff has ?€?supposedly?€? gone missing. Both times they have said that I sent them a personal item and could I tell them what that item was. How could I tell them what it was when I didn?€?t send it. This time I asked well if I sent a personal item are you not gonna return it, I was told to give it more timeMy items might turn up. Well I know for a fact I returned the items but once again I?€?m without my purchases and money because Temu don?€?t wanna pay me back my money. What?€?s the point in them saying keep the proof of postage and they also ask for it for them to still say no. They may sell to many people but there?€?s also some shady stuff going on Replying to Temu response below. I have tried to get a refund and they said they can?€?t give me a refund because I returned the items back and they were either missing barcodes or the items were missing. So I received the items but I returned them and I have proof of posting and because of missing barcodes or items they said they won?€?t give me my money back Temus response via customer service through the app was In this return process, for the 5 items you applied to return, after a careful inspection by the warehouse, we have confirmed that the warehouse actually received 0 items and did not receive 5 items. As a result, we must follow some further confirmation measures to provide you with a refund.

I contacted customer service support for assistance and how can this problem be resolve and the only reasoning communicated was it was the ""system"" that was the cause. Understood that the ""system"" had flagged my account and asking what could be done to rectify this. Again no solution nor willingness to assist. I'm truly disappointed and frustrated with them that they were so willing to lose a customer. Now I 'll have to take my business to a competitor and have negative comments on this company.

"Another disappointing delivery!Having had some issues with missing items, I decided this time to film the package being opened and removed. I was hoping there wouldn?€?t be a problem but this time there were two items missing. I sent the video to Temu as proof and STILL they are refusing to refund, saying: We are extremely sorry to hear that you have encountered an issue with your purchase , after verifying our warehouse they have confirmed that the items was indeed packaged and shipped to you in accordance with your submitted order information. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused as we are unable to support your request to return the related items that i mention above.It?€?s very clear that Temu cannot be trusted to package their items carefully and clearly do not believe their customers even when they show video evidence!Perhaps SHEIN is the way to go?",1,08/06/2023

"I invited my son to the temu app and and he used his less than 30 day old email to sign up for the first time yet, Temu told me that he set up a temu account 166 days ago. How is that possible...

addictivebetter than shein. temu allows returns and refunds but shein make it very dificult to get return or refund and u have to wait 3 days to hear a reply but temu has a live chat.i would avoid downloading app i dont download any app even bank app or taxi app because this is so easy for hackersalso never save ur main card payment details on any websitehackers have got money this way on taxi apps and tesconever give main number or main emailalways use alts.one thing that annoys me with temu is the daily spam emails of special offers but other than that its good.i have some really cool handy thingsbetter than ali expressbetter than shein,5,08/06/2023

Some how they get the full detail of credit card and bank account.We think it's cheaper but finally buyer is the big looser. On the Web site they forced to follow their way If we add in cart and thinking to buy next day, but they change quantities and add ???? the other products Be careful Think 10 times before you go inThis is my bad experience Credit cards don't believe and .they don't put the dispute form any of 4 cards.

Scored 1 as zero score not an option . Disgraceful business that would not credit returns I made despite everything being returned in same packaging and all items unused as per their returns policy.

"I am reviewing based on delivery time. There is some deception when Temu calls their app Temu Canada, it gives the customer the impression that goods are being shipped from within Canada. I prefer to shop locally and not wait this long to receive my purchases. For me shopping provides some sort of gratification and to wait days to get your goods is boring and torturing.  Also tracking lies. One time they say your package will arrive a certain day and a few hours later another text advises that the goods will arrive another time, perhaps end of the month. As a first time customer,I am not impressed with how long it takes.",2,08/06/2023

"I ordered some items, and they got delayed in the customs. Temu has a delivery guarantee, so if the items do not arrive within the stipulated time, you will receive a discount that you can use for your next purchase. Shipping is free. Definitely satisfied with TEMU.",4,09/06/2023
"UPDATE: My phone number was somehow leaked and now scammers send me links to my phone under the name TEMU. I don't know what happens if I click, but my number leaking by Temu is a huge red flag. I bought some stuff, and I'm not unsatisfied. Yet I did not get what I wanted and wasted a lot of my free time. Through facebook, my wife got an offer which she immediately clicked. It said FREE (9.75meter Cloud Light). When she downloaded the app, it offered her 7 items, 3 free (It said first 3 free but that is not true, it's random). But the problem is the FREE item she found on facebook was not available! And all the rest were nothing similar, so we wasted a lot of time and did not get what we wanted. I'm sure it was on purpose to lure us in the app as the rest of the items were all half and below the price of the non available item. Thank you for the next offer but that it's not ok.",1,09/06/2023
"I've been ordering items from Temu for several months and have been very impressed with the quality of items, price, and customer service. I've had to return items occasionally because they either don't fit me or the fabric/style is not what I expected. The customer service people that I have communicated with over the company's chat system have always been very friendly, professional and helpful in resolving any issues. I've been pleasantly surprised with my overall experience dealing with Temu.",5,09/06/2023
"I placed an order late last summer and the products were never received. I am now no longer able to order from this website. I have repeatedly tried to contact Temu and explained the situation. I checked with all my neighbors to see if this was delivered in error, but no one else received this package.  After discussing with a customer representative I was told this would be cleared up, and that I should once again be able to use the site, but still am not able to order. I have sent recent e-mails with no response. I was happy with the products I did receive, but this situation is very frustrating!",1,09/06/2023
"First of all this is a global scam company selling counterfeit items. They are not only copying the designs, but also stealing the photos of small and big companies alike. Second: Temu is not paying any taxes in Europe. So basically they just suck the worlds money, filling our houses with cheap stuff and useless plastic! Their products do not follow any safety regulations that are so strict in Europe (that European producers must follow). Why don't these apply to Temu if they sell products throughout Europe? Third they are polluting the earth with endless plastic packaging, cheap useless products, that usually can only be used once and they break, or they are so cheap, that people do not give any value to it and throw it away after one use. We are all so concerned about the 'plastic in the oceans', well, those plastics are from Temu and giant companies alike, so don't be surprised the oceans are filled with plastic after shopping 'like a millionaire' at Temu. Temu creates mindless shopping society that shops without giving a second thought about 'creators rights' , 'society', 'business regulations and fair business rules', 'ecology'. Its you right to choose if you want to be a part of this global scam by buying the products from them.",1,09/06/2023

"Now when you send the 100% first item back you have put the limit to get this up to $50 minimum spend, it's toooo much, you are getting greadey again.

"BEWARE! This company does not comply with British retail law.The above order was delivered by 'EVRI' - late! (Temu gave a ??4 'late' refund.) (EVRI used to be called Hermes - which if you read their review history on here you will discover has one of the worst review histories ever.)Temu refused to refund for the two missing items - saying that the goods left their establishment intact. However I know they were missing. They do not show any evidence of 'inclusion' but they have my photographic evidence that they are not on the tray that I unpacked them on. So it's their word against mine.They were very quick to deny my claim.On further examining the package it is clear that it was ripped - then 'repaired' with clear tape. So if Temu have 100% integrity - and I can assure you that I do too - then it must have been 'nicked' by the courier. When EVRI were Hermes one of their couriers went through an elaborate procedure to 'deliver' an expensive leather jacket. His false completion of 'sorry you weren't in' card and false pictures of it on our doorstep - there were two parcels to 'deliver' - then walking away with the 'Joe Brown's' leather jacket box without ringing the bell, were all captured on CCTV - only to be accosted by my partner - in bare feet - to wrest the package off a very sheepish thief 100 yds down the road. He performed his 'trick' directly under the purview of the CCTV front door camera!The courier who delivered the Temu package was very camera shy - he wore a black close-fitting hoodie - with just a tiny part of his face showing - and carefully placed the package in the 'parcel chute' - ripped-side down - in the 'proof of delivery' photo. Whilst his identity would be easy to ascertain if Temu took it further - he probably felt more confident that it would be difficult to retrieve the delivery information and who and when had tampered with the package en route.Temu have refused to claim from the courier company and will not engage in insurance-claim processes. They have refused to engage in any discussion about the sender being liable if non-delivery occurs in the British retail law processes.We take online platforms and payment systems for granted in the UK. In the rare event of non-delivery occurring with eBay, they are very good at rectifying the problem - as are PayPal - who I believe were very closely aligned with eBay. Amazon too are very good at refunding for missing items (even when they too were hit with 'interception' fraud in my district.) But Temu? Be wary.So what do I do about Temu? I can assure you - with as much photographic proof as I can - that the items were not delivered - which if Temu's response is to be believed - must have been removed in transit. I would be willing to sign an affidavit to state the items were not present.The courier who delivered the package was very keen to hide his identity from my CCTV cameras - and placed the package in the delivery chute so you couldn't see the 'tear'. He wore a hoody masking most of his face.Stupidly I have another Temu order in the pipeline - but it is my last. And hopefully it will all arrive in an intact package - presumably by 'EVRI/Hermes' (Who are due for a name change soon - not long now until they reach their 'poor review' threshold!)With the Temu App now uninstalled - it's Adieu from me.Adieu Postscript: Temu have replied - not a surprise - as they apparently always do for negative reviews.But the fact that they have adjudged the case with 'Claim Denied' doesn't alter the fact that the items were removed - and they can only conclude that the customer - or someone - is dishonest.It's a bit brass neck - when they've received an excoriating review - to suddenly discover the British-retail best practice.If you read their other gushing responses they are always 'improving our service'.. 'wanting to improve customer processes' etc. So their responses are just insincere platitudes. If they now pledge to replace the missing items - I'd be sick. 'Goodwill' becomes 'Badwill'. Adieu Adieu Adieu",2,09/06/2023

"IN RESPONSE TO TEMU'S RESPONSE DATED 04/21/24:  If I am NOT USING THIS TEMU ACCOUNT, how does this occur?  ""We have detected unusual activities on your account. To protect you, our system has temporarily placed your order on hold.""  I haven't placed an order for 3 MONTHS, what  ""unusual"" activity is occurring?????????????  Does someone have access to my account information? ***************************************This review is more of a WARNING!!!!!!!  I had been a shopper of Temu products for quite some time (over 100+ orders placed).  I really enjoyed my shopping experience with Temu during this time (maybe I should really be THANKING TEMU because I was honestly ADDICTED).  I played multiple games and was awarded prizes that I personally selected.  Refunds were issued for damaged items without any problems.  On occasion, Temu would suggest not returning an item and still refund the cost.  The only concern that I had was the method that Temu used to issue refunds, if you refused a Temu credit.  YOU NEVER RECEIVED THE FULL AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID (seems like suspicious purchasing practices to me).  I HAD NO PROBLEMS UNTIL.......In January of 2024, I was restricted from making purchases from Temu.  I asked on MANY OCCASIONS what the problem was.  It was clear that the customer service representatives ""COPIED & PASTED"" language that they were instructed to provide.  Each representative reported ""THERE WERE ANOMALIES FOUND ON MY ACCOUNT.""  I continued to ask what that meant and the response was always ""there were anomalies found on my account!""  I advised that I didn't understand the meaning of the word ANOMALY.  They continued to respond the same.I researched the word ""ANOMALY"" and found that it meant ""something wrong.""  I AGAIN asked Temu representatives to provide THE EXACT DETAILS OF THE PROBLEM with this account.  To no avail.  I then was told that an investigation was taking place on my account.  A couple of other representatives advised me to find another method of payment.  I followed those instructions and was still DENIED placing orders with Temu.  I followed up 2-3 months later, and was told AGAIN that ""THERE WERE ANOMALIES FOUND ON MY ACCOUNT.  I investigated a bit further and found that my credit card company had reported a payment to Temu as fraudulent.  This was done in error by the credit card representative because I had reported a previous charge as fraudulent on my credit card.  I reported this to Temu and they advised that they would ""investigate.""  I followed up 2-3 months later, and was told ""THERE WERE ANOMALIES FOUND ON MY ACCOUNT."" Low & behold, I was reviewing a credit card statement and found that there was a charge from Temu.  I was very bewildered because my purchasing privileges had been suspended by Temu. I contacted my credit card company to advise that this purchase was ""FRADULENT"" because Temu had suspended my purchasing privileges.  I also contacted Temu to report this said transaction and asked if a Temu employee had gained access to my account information.  Temu of course responded NO.  My credit card company issued a credit to my account.  However, I am EXTREMELY WORRIED that someone on Temu's side has access to my account information because when I randomly reach out to Temu to ask for the status of my account, I am still told ""THERE WERE ANOMALIES FOUND ON MY ACCOUNT!""DO NOT USE CREDIT CARDS!PLEASE USE PAYPAL, PREPAID DEBIT CARDS, KLARMA, AFTERPAY OR AFFIRM!",3,09/06/2023

My granddaughter introduced me to TEMU...  I was fascinated by the little games and offers of free gifts and discounts.  After 6mths of 'tending a farm' and getting to 99% of the win - after the last 5% had been deliberately slowed down so you won much less each time....guess what happened?!  They shut my farm down and started me again at 40%!  What a shocking con!  The products may or may not be cheap for tat but I had ??100 worth in my basket waiting for me to buy along 'winning' the free gifts and discounts.  I've just closed the account.  I'm annoyed I was strung along this far but I guess there's no fool like an old fool.....  It's sad that people are subjected to this.  There is psychological control going on here...,1,10/06/2023
"The 1* is for TEMU?€?s choice of delivery company they use in the UK, how can a driver tell TEMU it was delivered through a letterbox when obviously it was too large for that, and the package was found by myself at 1:30am on my doorstep, it was so lucky that it was still there, all of the last 3 deliveries from EVRI were left on the doorstep and all were stolen, they are total scum as a company and there driver who has delivered to me is a lying scum, twice now he has said he delivered through my letterbox, luckily this last one was found on the doorstep but the others went missing. Evri are a total disgrace and any company using them will never again have my business ????????I can see that your answer is rubbish because you haven?€?t even read my review properly, I have my order but have been lied too again by EVRI, and your comment to contact EVRI is BS, there is no way you can talk to anyone at EVRI it?€?s impossible, and that is the reason I?€?m complaining to you, because it?€?s you that employ them to deliver our goods, and if you check you will know that my order would never go through a letterbox ????????",1,10/06/2023

They replied under my review  that I should enter the site, follow some steps and that my money would be returned to me immediately. I did it and once again they refused. The polite answers they give to every negative comment are fake and their purpose is to make the buyers see that they are kind, honest and proper professionals. THEY ARE NOT!!!!

I am getting many SMS text messages from temu even though I do not have my phone number registered in my account. Says unsubscribe in app but I am not subscribed in app!,1,10/06/2023
Really like this company. Items take about a week to reach me but they have always been worth the wait. Very good value and price so reasonable. Great for finding dupes of more expensive clothes from high street stores and also finding unique items and gifts. Very good stop for gadgets and other bits and bobs. I prefer SHEIN with their way to earn points by check in and reviews but Temu is a close 2nd place for my go-to online shopping.,5,10/06/2023

I don??t understand the bad reviews. So far after 6 orders for more than 200 Euros everything worked perfectly. Goods came on time. OK - some of the things are not really very high quality. But for that price it can be expected that you sometimes have to make a compromise. And it can be returned for a refund - no questions asked. Customer service if needed via the bot is excellent and fast as well as customer orientated. Its Amazon standard. Returns and refunds are never a problem. We will keep using Temu as they are probably getting their goods from the same sources as the local wholesellers which then hit their retail  clients with a 100% margin for the identical items.,5,11/06/2023
i have been using Temu for some time and have been satisfied until now. I ordered a ornament for the garden which didnt arrive but instead you sent me three mugs with son on. As i only ordered one as I have only one son I was very disapointed and have got two mus that are no use.,3,11/06/2023

"They have started to scam people with no deliveries. Thankfully i paid via paypal so disputed my money and got a refund. Temu kept saying my parcel was delivered after their 'investigations' therefore would not refund.

Evri also had a part to play, they provided false information of tracking and the delivery guy james something did not deliver nor update his delivery info!Update: so Temu wanted more information, after countless times of closing my concerns raised. Temu you thought you could scam and fob me but thank God i never used my bank card. You are frauds, and all you do is scam, no one bothered talking to me kept closing every ticket raised with my concerns. I have deleted your app, so stop spamming my emails and asking for more info, you didn't deal with it when i raised this many times for the last 2 weeks and now you are getting all so eager to resolve. Well Paypal have refunded me so dont even bother 'investigating your pathetic excuses'",1,11/06/2023

"I honestly have not experienced any of the issues others have had. I?€?ve ordered quite a lot and multiple orders. Delivery is quick. Yes, I?€?ve had the occasional broken item, incorrect item sent etc, however, these were resolved quickly. I?€?ve gotten refunds or store credit (and you have the option to return it free for a replacement if you want). I even got a refund for an entire order when my dispute was for just one item which was like $4. I got a store credit for the entire order which was $63. I contacted them to tell them they made an error that it was just one item. They replied to let me know they?€?re aware of that but credited the order  for being a good customer. So I got all the items for free. That said, a Temu update today has me concerned and it?€?ll probably be the end of my Temu ordering. From what I can gather, items will now be sent directly from the supplier. So multiple items means multiple packages. AliExpress do this and it?€?s a nightmare. I have 2 orders that say shipped and delivered yet tracking shows they never left China. I?€?ve put in disputes 3 weeks ago but they?€?ve not been addressed. If Temu go this route, there is no way I?€?m going bother anymore. Shein will most likely do the same as they?€?re apparently owned by the same person/company. I just looked in my cart and I have 60 items. All but 2 are different sellers. So 59 will have their own seperate tracking numbers and a lot of those will probably be the ?€?un trackable?€? ones (ie: scam. End up not being delivered but claiming they have been)",5,11/06/2023

"I have used Temu for more than a year and would have rated them a 10 if possible, UNTIL TODAY, when I called to return a few items from an order that arrived 31 days ago.  20% was deducted from the sales price to set the refund amount.  I asked if I would be refunded the tax based on the full sales price and the Rep didn't know.  In addition she told me that they are charging shipping unless you purchase $30 from one ""store"".  I asked what she meant and found out that they are operating like Etsy only refunds and problems go through Temu (so far) and not through each ""store"" as Etsy does.",3,11/06/2023
"Ok. Most of these companies suck, like shein. You get garbage.  Not here. I was so amazed I decided to write this.  Everything I got surpassed what I expected in a major way. The rhinestones shoes fit. The sunglasses and earring do not look or feel cheap. I even against my better judgement bought a cute polyester nightshirt assuming it was cheap for 4 bucks and if it was I would toss it. But, amazingly, not only was the fabric acceptable for my fancy self...lol... but its not polyester at all but modal.

Temu consistently lies about free products. Twice I tried to get some advertised free item and both times ended being told it was only free after I bought a minimum dollar amount. Keep in mind this is a Chinese Communist supported competitor of Amazon. So why would we buy anything? The stuff is so cheap because China subsidizes them.    The response from Temu confirms they are liars. I can't believe they gave such a lame excuse.,1,12/06/2023

"I had the most frustrating experience with Temu. I placed an order on March 30th with a promised delivery window between April 6th and 13th. However, after waiting patiently for a month, I was informed that my package was at a pickup point far from my city. When I requested delivery to my address, they claimed it was incorrect, despite receiving orders from reputable platforms like Amazon and AliExpress at the same address without any issues.Their solution? They asked me to contact DHL myself, providing me with a useless number that was never reachable. Despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue through their support, they refused to take responsibility or make any effort to rectify the situation. They even refused to request DHL to make a delivery attempt, leaving me with no option but to cancel and demand a refund.My advice to anyone considering using Temu, steer clear. Save yourself the headache and frustration of dealing with this fraudulent platform. Their lack of accountability, poor customer service, and inability to fulfill orders make them a company to avoid at all costs. Don't make the same mistake I did; shop elsewhere for your peace of mind.",1,12/06/2023

I should have written a review about Temu before now but better late than never lol! ( I am so very sorry for anyone who has had a bad experienceI with Temu) i look on the Temu site almost every day I love it I'm so glad I came across Temu a while back and I'm so very glad I did and over the past few months I have ordered things like clothing womens and mens clothing also makeup jewellery plush toys and bedding and other things etc also beautiful baby clothes baby shoes for my granddaughter their prices are heavily discounted ( to be honest I was a bit sceptical at first because of the low prices ) but I'm glad that I've ordered things from Temu because the quality in the clothing and toys baby clothes etc has been high quality and so has the toys I've bought also the jewellery is lovely to be really honest Temu is really lovely for good bargains it's just a lovely site with some great items which are high quality and  at bargain prices I would very highly recommend Temu and thankyou for good communication keeping me updated with e-mails and tracking thankyou Temu for an excellent service in every way my most recent order was on 13th April 2024 and I will definitely be ordering from you again Temu thankyou for a fabulous service.,5,12/06/2023

Everything OK with Temu only thing is they put up the purchase amount in Ireland and in found out  other country's you can order from as little  wjth no purchas limit and still get  it delivered but here in Ireland we had first 10 euro  then 20 now it gone up to 25 euro  so I can't see why one Country has a limit and others don't  as not everyone wants to spend 25 euro in on go they should have left it a 10 euro well in England there is no limit so what ye are saying is rubbish,3,12/06/2023
"You get what you pay for. If it is very cheap, then don't expect top quality, but sometimes you will be surprised.I buy regularly.Their refund service is excellent and prompt. I did receive 1 item that stank from BO, perfume and smoke. They didn't quibble, refunded and even told me to keep it. It was too small anyway, so I washed it and donated it to a charity shop. Win-win.We have a fantastic Evri driver who always puts it in our safe place when I'm not in, so deliveries are never a problem. Their special offers are amazing and I do end up spending more than I mean to. Minimum of ??15 for free postage is incredible, given the cheap prices.Yes, some of it is poor quality, but can be returned for free.

When I added it to my cart the price changed to $53.98. I contacted customer service via online chat and was given every excuse to why the price changed. By the end of my chat I was told I will be contacted by someone in the next 24 hours to resolve the matter.

"The truth is, you can find the same items on Amazon for 30% more. So, what's not to like? The gamification they add to the whole experience is super cool, and as an online marketing professional, they give me great engagement ideas for my marketing efforts. I guess some might find the constant emails about special deals and discounts annoying, but I don't; I love it.   Returns are never a hassle, and I've gotten some great things for my upcoming wedding and honeymoon.  I'd compare their shoes to the quality you'd find in Payless.  The clothing, by and large, is pretty decent. It was nothing great, although I got some short-sleeved shirts for the upcoming summer that were of pretty decent quality.  For little ""trinkets"" and small gifts, you can't go wrong.  Lastly, I've grabbed a few electronic items off the site and have been impressed by their quality.  The only thing that can be a bit dicey is how they pack things. It's actually kind of funny; everything typically gets squished into one bag, so something like a hat just gets crushed in shipping. I never buy anything from the site that's a ""must have"" -- it's all just fun. So if something comes damaged, they take care of returns without any hassle.",5,13/06/2023

"Absolutely rubbish customer service, not honest at all, they either deliver very late or can't locate packages. They have poor and really rude customer service and after u tell them problem and explain all then without notice they will transfer and then again u will have to repeat urself, I got transferred at least 5 times in each live chat and on phone until I give up, every time they have wasted over an hour with no help, at the end they say that the revenant team will contact me in 24 hours but that never happens because thats been said to push customer away who won't give up. Poor packaging and worst then dollarama quality products. Employees can't speak or understand English and they all have a script that they read to all customers, I have dealt with many temu agent and they all repeatedly say exactly same lines, word to word same, on live chat or on phone. Today I asked them random question on phone and they didn't understand and when I asked to repeat what I said then agent went silent and carried on with given script saying sorry and rest sweet lines. I asked several time but off topic. So it's like talking to walls. I have paid for orders which I still haven't received and it has been over a month. I highly recomend to stay away from temu.

"I tested my first purchase and I had a great experience with TEMU. I am so happy with the products and on time delivery to my little village in Tulum Mexico. Immediately I ordered more products from Temu the second time, my nightmare begins. I paid but until now I can't get my products. The delivery company said they do not deliver anymore (what!!!) to my receiving address and I have to collect the products at his place. The shop never opened,  I went to the shop 3 times! I am still waiting for Temu's help. This is unbelievable.",5,15/06/2023
"Absolutely joke, waiting for and item to be delivered, eventually accepted it was not coming despite assurances from Temu that it was on its way. Almost an hour communicating with with an online ?€?assistant?€? they conceded they did not know where the package was but were unprepared to send a replacement. I did eventually obtain a refund ??17.00 but no remuneration for my loss of time. My advice avoid Temu unless you you have a lot of time on your hands.",1,15/06/2023
"wrong comunication from their side, sent me info on wrong email, sent damage products, didnt want to replace it, its all cheap stuff, bad or wick quality, do not spend your money on these items;not worhting , plus bad packinging, coming in parts damaged;not again; termu is history for me! bad very bad experience;",1,15/06/2023

"The games are pretty fun and cool until you get stuck for a long period of time and you can never actually reach the free items. Moreover, this company has been searched for data-stealing like the last app from this corporation and they are definitely making people work restlessly in a factory for hours on end with ridiculously low wages.The prices are cheap but the products themselves are nothing like advertised and are pretty poor quality. Almost always you are missing an item without notice.To conclude, I deleted the app after one pitiful purchase and after being aware of their scandalous activity regarding data-stealing. DON?€?T GET!",2,15/06/2023

I ordered a cream coat that looked lovely on the site but in reality is thin almost see through and the material is awful. Whatever you wear shows right through it.

Can anyone answer the question on if they ever get the free products from the promotions such as farm and fish? I've been playing these for a little while and if you invite someone yes you get money off (up to 5 dollars for new) then the second person is half of that (up to 2.50) then when you're sooooo close (50 cents left) your fish/wheat grow by 0.10 percent and you get 0.02 cents off and just as soon as you're potentially set to get the rewards time expires and if you choose to you have to start over..... I won't as it's a waste of time..... I'd rather wait to get the items by paying for them instead of wasting my time on the games you can't win,3,16/06/2023

"I have been *careful* about what I order from Temu. I have placed 8-10 orders maybe.  Usually, I have gotten what I expected, but on one order, 2 of 3 things I ordered were wrong. One item was the wrong color. Another item comprised a few parts rather than parts and a tool as I had ordered.But Temu has been very good about giving credit refunds.Temu has also honored their policy of providing a $5 credit if a package is late.A lot of people write that Temu stuff is garbage. Very likely true. But I try to pick things that I think are more likely to work out, and that strategy seems to have worked. I do NOT buy electronics on Temu.  Instead, I look to buy things that are fairly simple to manufacture, like hooks, cell phone holders, double-sided sticky tape, etc. Of course the product reviews in Temu are totally worthless.  Almost all of them are written by bots.If Temu didn't condone (or even encourage) massive fake reviews, I would give them at least 4 stars. But the fake reviews are a serious problem and at best I can give Temu 3 stars as a result.",3,17/06/2023

Terrible scammers. Ordered and paid and when parcel arrived it had clearly been opened and sellotaped down. Some items were missing. I took photos and sent them to Temu who refused to give me a refund or replacement as they said items had been dispatched from china. I explained they may have but didn?€?t make it to England. They have stolen my money. Avoid at all cost. Terrible company.And you reply with a generic reply that means nothing as obviously I have already spoke. With the team at Temu who talk absolute nonsense,1,17/06/2023
My mum recently had 96 Gbp deducted from her bank account for a Temu subscription. I have tried contacting Temu to find out when she applied for this and cannot get an answer.

However I'm now 3 days beyond the latest possible delivery date now and no idea when it'll be delivered, if ever. As soon as I saw the words Evri I knew there would be problems. In the meantime I continue to receive about 4 or 5 emails a day, sometimes more, mostly trying to tempt me to buy yet more stuff that may or may never arrive. No thanks Temu, they've all gone in the bin. Interested now to see if this parcel ever turns up and what my ??11 (after the ??4 credit for missing their delivery deadline) actually bought me. Great concept and so good on paper, just sad that the delivery aspect is so poor.",1,17/06/2023
"Very difficult to review, a rather Jekyl and Hyde experience.The Positives : Loads and loads of products at low prices. Ordering online is simple. Communication was very good, so was delivery time. Received a day late and was given a ??4.00 credit. 2 items good for the price. Time will tell though.Negatives: Some of the pictures give a better impression of the item than it actually is. Some items much smaller than the pic suggests. The quoted "" saving "" well, judge for yourself. Some items, whilst really inexpensive are destined for the Tip recycler before too long. That's not to say they were not value for money if one needed a minimal use item and could not afford better, but such prices usually mean short life. So, in an effort to save the Planet from waste, lets all pay a bit more, and Temu sell better products.",3,17/06/2023
"This site is using photos from legit online boutiques. And obviously this not the quality they deliver. In a nutshell, never never buy from TEMU.

"Received my order today, I was surprised at how good the quality and finish of the items are. I thought delivery time was reasonable and prices are exceptional, I've seen similar items online at twice the price.

Plus they make such good deals and discounts regular basis !I found exact same stuff on Amazon 2x times the price, hell na. The best thing I ever ordered was 3in1 ceramic multi cooker.

I was surprised to get emails on 11 April that my orders had been delivered and signed for! Delivered where....because I have nit yet received my parcels to date! Upon tracking the parcels...it shows they have been delivered but not to me it seems because I don't have them! Tried calling the buffalo logistics number...it referred me to their whatsapp number. Tried that but not helpful at all. Emailed their customer service support and have not received feedback to date!!,1,18/06/2023

"I thought, I must write a 2nd review, after being with TEMU for 6 months now. Honestly, they have never let me down ever, and yes it is addictive, but then when you look through the list of DIY, Clothing, Tech, you can see why. I have probably made, by now, 75 orders, perhaps with 10 items on each, but it has not broke the bank, with items often being as low as 27p.  Even jeans, denim jackets, t shirts to 'die' for, the gear just keeps coming, and best of all they use Evri to deliver the goods, who also never let me down.  I have only ever had to return one item, and it was my fault, wrong size, and the process was so easy, Temu handled everything, all I had to do was go to the post office, the goods were received by Temu to a centre in the UK, and I was credited immediately. Compare this, (and I do need to hilite this, as this is important), but if I order something from example Etsy or Ali Express, any faulty goods have to go back to the origin (thousands of miles away), which could take weeks, if the return goods ever even get there, but with Temu, they handle everything here in the UK.  Another feature I love about Temu, is if you have ordered something, and realise you forgot to order a further item, you can just add it to your order, as long as the initial order has not yet been despatched.  The praises just go on and on for Temu.  And as a final bonus, recently an order came late, 1 order out of 75, and Temu automatically (at the time of writing) credited me with ??4, just because it was a day or two late. How amazing is that.  Here's to the next 6 months with Temu.",5,18/06/2023
"I ordered several items and when I received the package it was obvious there was a problem as the package looked sort of empty on the one side. Usually their packages are stuffed, by this I mean whatever you order they usually use the smallest packaging they can which makes the package look stuffed no matter the size. So mine had tears all over it and a large hole in the top. I proceeded to take pictures of it and then opened it to discover that there were several items missing and one that had been crushed and broken badly. Contacted customer service only to be told that the warehouse stated that everything was there and it was packaged correctly when it left there. But yet I have pictures showing the tape stopped just short of the ""hole"" and it would be plenty big enough of a hole to allow smaller items to escape. So they denied my request completely and blindly. So now I'm out over a 110 us dollars and no way to recoup my losses. They only stand behind their product when it's a small or cheap item but when it starts running into higher amounts or multiple items they hurry up and say no!",1,18/06/2023
"In response to your reply: Customer satisfaction is a bogus claim, you don't exemplify that after getting several messages on your App. If you cared, this wouldn't have reached to this extent, so don't type stereotypical response again. Countless messages were left and none of you cared to address it whole day yesterday leaving me in discomfort now._-------Bogus company and worst customer support. They have chatbots talking to you most of the time and behind the screen are the crooks who would repeat the same lines to frustrate you. Bought a lens cleaner that destroyed my eyeglasses - raised a complaint after chatting for 45 minutes and today I received a message asking same information that I provided yesterday. Trying to connect with them for 4 hours but these crooks are not coming on a call and ignoring all my messages. I will be escalating this to the consumer forum now and won't let them escape. This is UK, not China that you can ignore and screw a customer who has bought several hundred pounds worth of items from you. Such a shame!",1,18/06/2023
"Just another update to the below. No-one from Temu contacted me. I went to the site to request the return labels to post back for the items I was complaining about to the 2 customer services officers in the previous chat.  There was a message to say they will offer a refund of $4.12 and I don't have to return the item.  The item is either faulty or not described correctly and costed $44.24.  It was for a stand for the Dyson.  It didn't hold my Dyson and the Dyson fell down and damaged by wall so that's extra cost for me. The $4.12 refund is insulting to me. I did have to contact them again and pretty much went through the same rigmarole wasting more of my time.  Just an update to the original review which you can see below if you scroll down.  Temu have contacted Trustpilot to get more information.  I replied and gave my name and email address that's on their system so they could read the history of the hour long chat from yesterday.  I then get another message from them, requesting me to contact their customer service team.  This just demonstrates how incompetent these people are.  They have my name and email address and they can contact me directly by emailing me but no, they don't want to look up the details and expect me to do all the running around and run after them, which I'm NOT going to do.  I've wasted enough time and energy on them.Absolutely useless customer service consultants who don't understand what the customer is asking. Also, when having to post items back, they dont email the labels to print out. I'm an older lady and not tech savvy so how am I supposed to print a label from a phone? I asked about that at the beginning of a chat and an hour later after 2 consutants, them asking questions about products that I had not even mentioned and advising at least 4 times what I was contacting them about, they kept asking the same questions. I finally got the answer about 1 hour later, that they don't email the labels. The last person sent me a screen shot of the return label. Seriously, how am I supposed to use a screen shot of a label to use to post something back? They make it so difficult. There's some good products but also a lot of rubbish, but after today's experience, I'm not buying again from Temu. It's not worth the hassle and that's what you can expect if you have to contact customer service.",1,19/06/2023

Customer satisfaction appears to be paramount. I have to say, I recently messaged over a colour issue on a bath mat .. a second grey mat we ordered arrived & was lighter than the first. Maybe I should have hit the ""buy again"" button rather than select from the range where the description, size, pattern & memory foam backing seemed identical.

Not able to connect with a human and getting ignored.  I would strongly advise people to not get involved with this company as if anything goes wrong they don?€?t want to know.  Very disappointing.

"I have been a loyal customer of TEMU for a while now and have always had positive experiences with their service. However, my recent shipment experience with Royal Mail has been extremely disappointing. TEMU recently switched to using Royal Mail for shipping, and it has been a nightmare.Our package was a month late, and the lack of communication from Royal Mail was frustrating. Despite providing my contact details, there were no updates once the package was handed over to Royal Mail. The constant changes in delivery times and the failure to notify me when they arrived for delivery made the experience even more frustrating.To make matters worse, the package was sent to a depot far away with limited opening hours, making it nearly impossible to retrieve. This entire ordeal has severely impacted my trust in TEMU's shipping process. I hope they address these issues to ensure a smoother shipping experience in the future.",1,20/06/2023

"I have never received this drone. I have ordered 7 items and received only 6. I did not receive the most expensive item. After opening my package, I informed Temu that I had not received the drone and sent the picture to prove it. It is all I could do. After one day I received information from Temu that the warehouse confirmed sending the drone. So the warehouse lied and I am the one who is punished for the lie. DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM! It was my first order with Temu and they have already ripped me off!",1,20/06/2023
I ordered a lipstick. It smells and taste like strong chemicals. It is not even the same appearance as on the pictures. The maker is DAIMANPU,1,20/06/2023
Really like Temu especially as they now have a telephone customer service. They have great things at good prices and in comparison to other retailers can be a lot cheaper. Some stuff is very good quality.,5,20/06/2023
I got my refund from Temu but not the taxes I paid.  I lost R400 on on order.,2,20/06/2023
it looks like i am just repeating what others say - i think its a scam - paid for and nothing delivered- apologise many times - numbers recieved many times BUT NO DELIVERY- never again with them - and they can take the 20 and shove it up thei .........,1,20/06/2023
"Self control is essential with this site. It's very easy to over spend and can be addictive. I still gave Temu a 5 star rating bc it's online, you clearly see what you r getting, and delivery time has exceeded my expectations so far. I've been unhappy with a few items but considering most of the clothes r true to size always measure to be sure. Before ordering I've learned to thoroughly check the materials used and scrutinize (as best as I can) the designs. The 2 piece sets just don't work for my body shape bc they only offer one size for tops and bottoms. Therefore the tankini bathing suits would never fit. It would be helpful to have the option of 2 sizes, one for the top and another for the bottoms of all clothing sets. I did just receive an item of clothing that was an obvious return. It was not folded but rather jammed into the bag in an haphazard manner. Upon opening, the item was unbelievably wrinkled. Temu needs to remove each return, refold, and bag properly. Plus, bc the clothes winkle so badly after washing, I've found hang drying works best.",5,20/06/2023
"i brought a large order for my niece and put in the correct address from my Pay Pal a/c,however because it was too large and many items they split the parcel in 2,one went to the correct address in New York and the other came to me in New Zealand,trying to get them to pick the parcel up and forward it on to NY has been a nightmare,spent hours in chat session and they just don't get it. Have now asked for a refund from Pay Pay.Will never ever shop Temu again and have told them as much,i also said they should put large items in a box then i wouldn't have what i can only describe as a nightmare.",1,20/06/2023
I ordered the Two piece jogging suit with pockets. I ordered a medium. There is no way that this was a medium.It was so small. I don't think there are on target with their sizes. I spoke to a few people that ordered from there and they were disappointed also in the sizes. I've ordered a few things from them now.One of the dresses I ordered was very very baggy.  I don't think I'll be ordered me again from this company. If I were getting my sizes correctly it's a great company to order from. It seems like my size and he was getting worse every time my order something.,2,20/06/2023

"Ordered thrice and we'll received BUT I have 1 problem with Temu.  I suppose their marketing ploy has worked in gaining traction and media publicity But their lies and deception are becoming transparent more and more.  When you receive and email or see that your inbox on the app shows promotions or discounts for you and you rush off to get it...then there is 1 stumbling block after the other. Whatever you do...DO NOT FALL for the FREE ITEMS promo. LIES! I tell you, they have a timer after you have invited over a 1000 new recruit able customers or contacts on your phone and then either the timer has a glitch or runs faster so pls WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BECOME VULNERABLE TO THIS. The prey on people's vulnerability and I do believe they sit with your contacts details...not sure how even if your contact  does not click the link I still believe that they can see how many shares you had. Also read their T&C you will see their is no definite structure.. they can change the rules at anytime and do not need to notify you. So how fair is that? I would say...right now  ..DELETE TEMU APP.. They are CORRUPT...I will go back to my SHEIN who has never shown this sort or corruption",1,20/06/2023

"Temu very recently put their charges to Australia up to$45 in order for customers to get free shipping. Previously it was a happy medium of $15 which I think was pretty good. Very disappointed as I ordered my art products and many things from Temu. Their service was excellent. However,because of the $45 I am unable to afford to use them and I don't think I am alone.",3,20/06/2023
"Temu website is great, it's the dodgy courier companies that they insist on using that bring them down. Temu know their courier's are making their customers' lives miserable but they still insist on using them. My parcels are either sent straight to a pick up point or they are dumped somewhere on the property. They don't provide proof of delivery and Temu refuse to give you a phone number that works for the courier company. Temu take absolutely no responsibility for the actions of their chosen courier.Temu have a delivery guarantee but that guarantee seems to stop the minute the driver claims they safely delivered the parcel. My courier dropped the parcel in the common area which was visible from the street even though I live in the ground floor 10 metres away from the main door. The bag was opened and the contents gone. I don't know if the courier stole it or if a passerby stole it but Temu don't care, as far as they are concerned, it's been delivered.You can't have the item delivered to a PO box because Australia Post wont accept parcels from couriers. You can't have it delivered to a business because most of the parcels are delivered by sub contractors who do it as a second job so deliver at night. Temu are doing absolutely nothing to ensure that customers actually receive their items and they don't even contact the courier company to complain about the way they treat us customers. I've given up on Temu. They have lied to me, disrespected me, deflected to pretend they didn't understand the problem and allowed their chosen courier to disrespect me for the last time.Save your money because if there is an issue, Temu will give you a $5 credit compo to spend on their site (minimum purchase $35) despite the issue being because of their actions, they won't refund your missing order.EDIT: In response to Temu's response, I DID contact Temu on multiple occasions both via the website and live chat and initially there was a refund request put through which Temu denied stating ""Refund deniedAfter verifying with our warehouse, we've confirmed that your items were indeed packaged and shipped to you. Your package was also shipped in good condition.""I ordered 4 items and received an empty plastic bag! How hard is that along with photographic evidence of what I actually received so hard to understand??? Yes it was shipped in good condition but it did not arrive into my hands in good condition!I am so fed up with Temu deflecting and publicly  pretending they want to help when I have done EVERYTHING right and they still wont help! I wish I was able to post screen shots of the conversations and other communications between myself and them to show that they are outright liars when it comes to their guarantees and that they REFUSE to hold their couriers to account or to take responsibility for their actions! Order ID is PO-012-17106117366390678 If Temu do the right thing and finally refund my order of their own accord then I'll come back and update my review but don't hold your breath, they would rather rip off a disabled pensioner $35.93 and have bad reviews than do the right thing and admit they screwed up!",1,20/06/2023
"I?€?ve bought quite a lot from Temu and have been very surprised at how quick they deliver to the UK usually 5 days.  The quality of some of the garments I have bought have not been bad at all considering the prices.  I bought a pullover that?€?s colour was nothing like advertised, had no problems with the returns, I did have to pay the postage I didn?€?t have a problem with that and got my refund almost immediately. Recently I bought a beautiful dress for a wedding I?€?m attending, again ??14 is so cheap and the dress actually was lovely. I would definitely recommend Temu far better than Shein.",4,20/06/2023
"I recently bought a bag from Temu and it's the second bag I've bought from the same vendor/seller. I've noticed a defect/missing part and I contacted customer service regarding the issue. I took pictures and compared them wihh the first bag that had no issues. Went thru 2 customer services associates plus one call back from a Supervisor which I've requested and both gave me the same answer. Here's what happened. I got the second bag at a lighting deal and the price was sold at $32.24. They requested me to return the bag to get a refund to repurchase it. But the refund takes an average of 4-5 days to get back to the warehouse for inspection first. Temu does not so exchanges. I asked customer svc what happened of the bag was returned and the price went back up. All the responses I got was ( even from Supervisor) was to wait for the price to drop. That was it. And they had no guarantees when the price would drop. What the heck kind of service is that. So basically if you got a defective item at a discounted price, you're out of luck to repurchase the same item at the same price! So it's your own fault to receive a defective item and it's up to you to rebuy the same bag/ item at whatever current price they are selling now They offered to give me some old coupon ( $2 off $59 and above) and I laughed and said what is that gonna do? So please BE AWARE for all your future purchases. If you happen to buy a certain item at a discount price, and it came defective, they do not exchange and DO NOT GUARANTEE you will ever get it back at the same price you paid before. So basically you're stuck with a defective item. And you're out of luck to get someone to see your side of the story. All they ever say was so sorry, all we can do is refund. Blah blah. Worst e-commerce service ever. Don't buy from them. It's a SCAM",1,21/06/2023

"Temu misled me with a promotional offer, requiring the purchase of seven additional items to receive a free promotional item. However, upon receipt, the item was much cheaper and of inferior quality. I advise against trusting them.Update: Temu doesn't allow you to send back the promotional item therefore I was not able to return the item. Temu only allows a customer to send back the additional purchased items and not the free promotional item. They swapped the leather duffel bag I had chosen as my free promotional item, which is listed at $142 for a much cheaper $15 sports poly/plastic bag. They did not reply to my query of grievance. I have now deleted my Temu account and urge others to do the same.",1,21/06/2023

"I was always a great advocate for shopping with TEMU. In the 1st few months , I just had great experiences, quick and wonderful customer service when a problem occurred. This time I am here to say I am very disappointed with the course of things are going with TEMU and how more complicated is to get a satisfying solution from customer service.Recently I ordered a top that was on offer for a great price and on the last day of the deadline for delivery I received my parcel and for my surprise it was a top completely different from the one of my choice. Ok, I got refunded and was able to keep the item I didn't want( that came stained and with loose stitches), but now to buy what I  originally ordered I have to pay 3x more and the item is out of stock at the moment.I tried to get a compensation of ??4 for not getting the item I chose on time, but they said my parcel was delivered, even if it had the wrong item inside. They apologise a lot , but that's all . No more coupons,just annoying emails  and messages on your phone every 5 minutes. It is sad to see something that was great decay like that. On another order I received the same day there was a missing item. What is going on TEMU?",2,21/06/2023
It's my first order with them and I've been bombarded with marketing every day. Pity their delivery doesn't match it. I've already been waiting nearly 3 weeks and received nothing. It's my first and last order with Temu,1,21/06/2023

"Hats arrived misshapen and crushed, unable to wear : ( I have been told by Temu that I can get a refund (thanks) but I ordered the hats because I wanted to actually wear them on my holiday which is next week, not because I wanted my money back. I have looked online to see how to correct the damage ie by steaming or ironing, so I?€?ll try that. This is my first time ordering clothes etc online, I normally just shop the traditional way. Dear Temu, when sending hats via post, please make sure you either fold the hats neatly so they do not arrive scrunched up, or use special hat boxes. Thank you ????",2,21/06/2023
"Because of the large quantity of items I bought via Temu, my order was split into 2 packages. I received both packages recently delivered via Buffalo Logistics to me here in South Africa. Upon arrival of the first package, I noticed that the bag the items were packaged in, was torn and taped closed again with black tape where the hole was. I noticed that 2 items were also missing from this package. I immediately brought the issue of the missing items to the attention of Temu as well as provided photos of the torn bag as proof, only to be informed that no refund will be given as the missing items were shipped as per Temu's warehouse. So it is obvious that Temu takes no responsibility for items lost during transit. I have not received these items and it is obvious then that the courier company damaged the bag during transport, but the way Temu handles the matter basically blames the customer for the loss. Also, all the items that were crammed into one plastic bag was way too heavy for a bag to be used as packaging material, and should have either been put in a box or then split into more separate bags, which should have prevented the bag from getting torn during transit in the first place. I will therefore unfortunately not shop with Temu again. I will also advise everyone I referred to Temu to be aware of their fake refund policy, which is basically non-existent.* update 12/4/2024 - Temu has since replied and will apparently look into this matter. I will update this review once I have received a favourable outcome.* update 30/4/2024 - Did not hear from Temu again after their reply to my original post. Have supplied all information and supporting documents as per their request, with only an automated response received thereto that they claim that everything was sent to me, so therefore not taking any responsibility for items lost in transit.",1,21/06/2023

"Deleted app. Will never order from them again. I don't like their blatant acts of deception and deceit.  They dangle a carrot which always has some catch to it. I will pay more to avoid a company that deliberately insults your intelligence. *Update concerning this matter. Temu made an offer in exchange for completed tasks of a generous credit upon completion. The first time I fell for it I was asked to share their link to so many people and I did like they said and sent it to a several  friends (which I despise doing that sort of thing). Instead of a reward I get a message stating one more friend needed to download app in order for me to qualify for the reward. I literally went out of my comfort zone, contacted a friend and asked them if they used Temu, they had not heard of the company. I asked if they would mind downloading the app and they did so. ....no reward instead another message saying I had to share with even more friends and get more new downloads.  I did a customer support chat and was told I still had to share more but couldn't give me how much was enough to qualify. The attitude made me feel they made qualifications up as they went along and I felt humiliated realizing I had been tricked, but I let it go. Then on this incident I was told if I placed an order and earned enough 'coins' I would receive yet another generous offer. As I placed the order it automatically took me to checkout which was an indicator I had achieved the 'coins' needed. NOT...instead I was told my order was lacking around $5 or something. I figured I may as well spend the $5 or so but when I made the order there was a $20 minimum. I spend the $20 thinking I met requirements. NOT... I get another message telling me I was just a few dollars short for the requirement and once again redirected to the product page where again a $20 minimum purchase. Tricked again. Twice I feel deceived and manipulated. Here's the thing, I've shopped Temu and they do have great prices and the products I ordered I did want, however, after chasing the carrot I felt humiliated and angry. I canceled both orders and I did rapidly receive refunds on both orders which surprises me after the trickery. I will pay more for a product before dealing with a company with no credibility willing to humiliate and trick their customers with endless tasks.",1,21/06/2023

Placed 2 orders with them the first just arrived and the quality is horrendous I?€?m dreading what the last one will look like. I certainly won?€?t order from them again if anyone is reading this please trust the bad reviews the company is rubbish.,1,22/06/2023
"My whole family order regularly from temu. Hubby has bought lots of new tools, drill, plastering gear.I have bought, clothes, crafts, kitchen ware, absolutely all sorts. We have never been let down. We are informed every step of the way with delivery. Returns are super easy. Never problems delivering. 99.9% of the stuff we have received has been perfect.I understand that no company is perfect, but we truly have had no problems.",5,22/06/2023
Overall temu is decent but delivered outwith the time period AND THERE IS NO WAY TO GET THE ??4 CREDIT. What a con!,3,22/06/2023
Items are different from advertised significantly though price and variety are good.I'm concerned about China's support for Russia though as Temu is a Chinese company so will not be making any purchases until this changesNo to all war and violence,2,22/06/2023
Only put 5 stars do that it?€?s one of the first reviews anyone can seePlease let me warn you this company is 100% fake and it?€?s only purpose is to scam people out of there money After you place order you will then contact them to ask why your goods have not arrived the response will be an automatic reply with lots of lies about anything and everything the normal one is the goods are waiting to be flown out it?€?s so silly it?€?s funny but the long and short is they want to scam you out of money,5,22/06/2023
I have been a customer for about 12 months and have always been 100% satisfied with the quality of goods and service.  Quick and efficient delivery and parcels always packed professionallly and carefully.  No mistakes too which is a great relief so they must obviously thoroughly check orders before despatch.  Always correct size sent and easy to order correct sizes.  I pay with PAYPAL which is quick and easy.  What I also like is you can add to your order easily.  I have recommended 3 people to TEMU and one has already ordered. Thankyou temu for a first class service.  I have recommended you on facebook.  Happy Customer.  Highly Recommended.,5,23/06/2023
"i don't understand how we keep promoting temu by sharing then when we get to the last stage then we get nothing ,I've tried several times and i still didn't get my free gifts , even today i have 2 on cue which is still hanging and i feel this is not fair at all .Temu should stop saying things are free when they want us to promote on their behalf then not fullfill their promise.",1,23/06/2023
It's a good company,5,23/06/2023
"I was wary of using this company but the prices were so good I decided to try it.  Two of the three items of clothing I ordered were of good quality, one was like a bit of rag.  Sadly I had to return all three because the two I liked were just too long. I had a free returns label and the next day my account was credited.  I was impressed and pleasantly surprised.",5,23/06/2023

"This company SUCKS! I ordered two sets (8) valve stem covers/caps for the tires on my car.  The first set was too small and, of course, wouldn?€?t screw on.  The second set, pushed the stem down resulting in the air flowing OUT of the tire.  Nothing buyt junk!",1,23/06/2023
"TEMU.com  restored my faith in online shopping.  Having been ripped off by several other online stores, I used to look at Temu for over a year but was afraid to take a chance.  I did put in an order finally, and I was surprised and very IMPRESSED with the speed of the order and the items inside. The only problem was a package of four pairs of underwear which had tags indicating that they were the size I ordered but they were at least 2 sizes too small.  Temu immediately refunded that package of 4 items.  Other clothing items I ordered fit perfectly and are so unique - I could not have found them where I live.  Some toys and building blocks for the grandchildren were a huge hit with them!  My second order is on its way to Temu and a third one is being made soon.  I am very happy with the variety of unique items available and the incredible prices which make it possible to purchase.  There ARE honest online sites and Temu is definitely one that I will return to again and again.",5,23/06/2023

"I must admit I was pretty sceptical about Temu at first so I ordered some low value items as a test. I have to say the service and overall quality of the items was a surprise. Subsequently, I ordered further items that were generally good quality at incredibly cheap prices. The returns process was also simple and efficient. Overall I would say just how impressed we have been, I know Temu has it's detractors for a multitude of reasons but we will certainly use this site again.",5,23/06/2023
I love this site it?€?s amazing load of cool stuff and very quick on delivery I love this site because I have got a lot of of good stuff of this site and it has helped me me in a lot of ways like my wedding etc and I am rating this 5 stars because it?€?s very helpful and when u get a problem they solve it really quick so thank you so much Temu,5,23/06/2023
"I had a problem, but Temu fixed it.  My 4th order from Temu was recorded as delivered by the delivery service they use, but I didn?€?t receive the package.  I looked everywhere, couldn?€?t find it, but the delivery company insisted it was delivered.  After I got in touch with Temu, they asked if I wanted a refund or a reshipment.  It only took 1 week for the reshipment to get here.  If you have a problem with Temu, give them a chance to fix it, they were very willing to help me, and I will continue to order from them!",5,23/06/2023

Doesnt wanna help you the moment your package doesnt arrive. They keep repeating the same things over and over. I just want my package. They take your money and wont give anything back for it. Edit 1:Asked me to contact them but can only get in contact with their bot that doesnt help me further either.Edit 2: Finally spoke to someone from temu but they again kept repeating the same stuff over again. Didn't get any further. So thanks Temu for the reply BUT PLEASE DO SOMETHING INSTEAD OF REPLYING AND NOT CHANGING ANYTHING OR HELPING!,1,23/06/2023
Be very careful.  I made an order. They then cancelled 2 items. And said I had a refund. That refund they say can not be passed back to your credit card. Also the refund seems to be on your account but it is difficult to use it. This is despicable practice and I am taking things forward to my credit card provider and trading standards.  I have not had my ballance of order delivered yet after 5 days so far. I am very concerned that it is an utter con.,1,23/06/2023
"Well what can I say ,it's a psychological assault, Offers galore that vanish and change and tease and morph,after taking offers and checking out,items you did not order appear in your order,like it's a glitch,it's not a glitch! It's a con,When you try to cancel this order you didn't place it tells you that you can cancel but it will void your whole offer ,Its con after con to get you to spend more ,as dodgy as dodgy Dave! Wasn't expecting good things from the item to photo ratios,but to be fair it wasn't bad ,but it was as good as goods from  Amazon ,if not exactly the  same , in fact it is the same ,it's the same dodgy ass ,cheap ass , to easy to obtain ,dopamine satisfying crap that is eventually going to kill you all ;but these guys have totally got sizing right and clothes fit well,unlike Amazon there clothes are way off so ignore the bad experience with Amazon sizes and order your size ,I kind of hate love them,love because the stuff is in and the sizes are correct,hate because of unnecessary check out con with the offers ,they really don't need to be that shady , because it's actually better than Amazon,also i hate because it's so good it will fill the world with one use stuff because it's so very good at selling you stuff you don't need and never will need using every phycology trick in the book ,blatantly honest crooks unlike Amazon who are just crooks ,",3,23/06/2023

"Not a bad company. Items are a bit better than  the average China junk you normally get. Prices ain't bad. Only downfall with this company is they are slow with delivering your purchases and use the worse courier company going-Hermes/Evri which is pretty sad. Still waiting for my goods to be delivered and I've actually had a delivery successfully made from China which has arrived quicker than temu items which were ordered at exact same time. Delivery stops me leaving a 5 star review sadly. Maybe if they changed courier and got there customers orders out quicker, then they'll have five stars.",3,24/06/2023

"I was quite concerned to place my first order with Temu, but after reading the excellent reviews I took the plunge and so pleased I did.  I have since ordered numerous items and I have been delighted.  There have been a couple of issues but their excellent customer services, who are contactable on line, have always put things right immmediately.  My husband is also hooked and has ordered several polo and casual shirts and many other different items.  I have told friends who now also order regularly.",5,24/06/2023

To be absolutely honest! My daughter ordered a huge bag of items! Everything was as good as their word! ????I was very sceptical about her order?How wrong I was! They were brilliant!

"Have bought from Temu a few times over the last year. First few orders were great - same quality products as you'd get from eBay/Amazon for much cheaper prices. The occasional product was faulty but returns were super easy to arrange. Clothing was very hit-or-miss though, and the dresses didn't correspond to the size guideIn my latest order, half the products were faulty or didn't match the dimensions of the listing. Returns were still really easy to arrange though",3,24/06/2023
"Temu is a scam site, selling products going under fraudulent names and claims. This site is so bold that it will show eelhoe hair oil and veganic hair oil side by side and have the nerve to compare the products and give fake reviews. Their items are cheap and made even cheaper. Clothes are not even close to descriptions or size. Every single vendor on here is a Chinese company who just changes the name of the company to make it appear as if your buying from different companies or vendors. Good luck if you want to attempt to purchase anything from this site but for me I will just stick to reputable companies that do not need to scam their customers for $2. Temu should be and needs to be shut down completely.",1,24/06/2023

The boxing ball is meant to be placed on desks or walls, but it doesn't stick for more than 5 seconds, regardless of the surface.

"Beyond terrible! Ordered some sweatsuits, they didn?€?t fit, I returned them the day after I received them. Tried contacting them (which is impossible) never heard from them. I assumed my refund was being processed. Tracked the package and found it was delivered, still never received any notification. Weeks later I received an email saying my return time had expired. They have no problem sending me 5 to 8 emails a day pushing other items. It was never easy dealing with their website. When ordering items I would always get notifications saying it was out of stock, the next day it was back in stock, end result was me receiving 2 and 3 of the same item. I don?€?t care how inexpensive they are, it?€?s not worth my time and total frustration. Do yourself a favor, don?€?t bother!!!!",1,24/06/2023

When writing to them, they don't care about their customers and don't personalize the delivery to avoid theft.They steal your money any chance they get. Their website is full of deceptive marketing and fake prices.Any decent e-commerce give you the chance of choosing signature to avoid theft.In my case I was just asking the to use USPS so packages can be left in a safebox they have a key for. They don't do anything about it.The use the delivery methods with the worst reputation, just to earn an extra dollar out of your order. My package was left in the front door of my building, on the eyes of everyone to be stolen. Perhaps the driver stole it.There was no way of filling a complaint. And was a waste of money and time. They know certain delivery names are awful, but they use them anyway. This delivery man was so lazy, could had left the package in my door. He left it where it could had been stolen.Lazy guy who didn't want to go upstairs. Working for the laziest, more copy paste, Temu customer service I ever saw.",1,25/06/2023

"While they have good products, I find it ridiculous when they ask customers to contact a carrier. This is their work to ensure an order arrives safely to the customer. Annoying and frustrating!",1,25/06/2023
Customer Services are a disgrace and just ignore what you're saying to them. I spent 45 minutes messaging one guy who just kept asking me to wait while he looked into it and then sent me literally the same response as before. Three times he did this before I escalated it. It was passed to someone else and they did exactly the same thing over three days. They kept replying as if they hadn't even read my messages. I think they play on being foreign and rely on people thinking they don't understand. I can't tell you how sick I am of Temu and their after sales care. I'm looking into referring it to their regulating body as a form complaint as they are not providing the Customer Service they promise.,1,25/06/2023

"I been ordering from Temu for a year now. I've had no issues with this company.. All orders are tracked, I know exactly when they will be at my door, if late they will notify you. The prices are very reasonable, their product are of great material and of great quality, real nice products. A person just needs to 2. Read reviews 3.. flip through the product pictures, there it lists the size of product 4. If clothes there is a size chart to go by. (I always get a bigger size than what I wear), for the clothes are sized to fit and I like a bit of room. 5. When ordering and you receive your order with something missing, there is a page that comes up when you go to my orders to where you can check off what is missing (that product) and they will reimburse you with in a few hours and you have a choice of credit back on your card or to your account, (I choose the account it's faster, for I'm always ordering anyway. 6. If late with an order to send you, they credit you $5 dollars. So what's to complain about. I have had a couple orders not reach me at there pacific time and I was credited the $5. I also was missing an item and it was easy, I checked off what was missing and they credited me. I was so glad I had ignored the bad reviews and took a chance to be not disappointed at all. They always lived up to there word and standards. There is a cite that's called snopes and they are so full of it. This company I tell you about Temu lives up to there standards of having great products and none are made of cheap material, I buy in our local stores and they are cheap and paying a high price for something that doesn't last, Temu has them beat all to heck. I buy from Temu first when wanting a product for I know I'm getting the best made at a lesser price and ther products last. Love there tools, I bought a set  of tools with a nice case and even in my favorite color purple, this way my husband won't use them, matches my purple tool box, they are if goud quality, can't beat thst.

"Not gonna lie, alot of people online haven't really been fans of the app but ever since I've started using it I just can't stop!!! My whole family literally loves it... the customer service, quality and basically everything is right on point. Talking about customer service, got a order yesterday, delivery was a bit late so when I sent them a message, a employee replied immediately and my credit was also given ASAP. Next thing I know, my order's already delivered. This just one example of how good there service really is. Temu's products didn't fail us either. Everything was perfect. A lot of people say there sizing is smaller than advertised but that just happened two me twice and even then it wasn't that small... There is also complaint's that they do credit card fraud but brooo cash on delivery option exists too... People also accuse Temu of using child labor, but than there is barely any proof and at the end of the day, the whole world runs on peoples labor, so this might should harsh but there is nothing we can do except pray for them and I also don't think they use child labor or mistreat there workers, I mean maybe you need to stop believing everything you see in the internet... though I might be wrong but that is the only thing I have against Temu (if I'm being honest I don't know if these accusations are true so for now Ima keep my mouth shut when it comes to that)... so in the future if there is really any actual proof of them using child labour and abusing there workers only than we should be against temu, other wise I think temu's a pretty sick :)",5,25/06/2023

Taking so long for items to arrive, stuck at the airport for ever then Evri or royal mail have it for ages before they send it out. Conveniently I always get it just on the date that they would have to refund me (and that period keeps stretching out longer and longer!) the stuff you get is pretty good really pleased with that and no problem or quibbling if something is broken or missing. Just a shame the delivery is letting everyone down.",3,26/06/2023
In my experience they are reliable. You need to always have a tape measure by your side because they try to make things look bigger than they are! If you don't block their notifications they will be absolutely relentless. The money off vouchers can be helpful but can't be used on furniture items. the minimum spend has been increased to 15 pounds which does put me off shopping with them.,4,26/06/2023

"I have shopped regularly with TEMU since June 2023.I have been, so far really impressed with everything I have purchased from them. Their Customer service is second to none and their no quibble refund system is super fast and efficient. Delivery averages between 5 to 10 days and is reliably conducted by EVRI who I have found also to be faultless.HIGHLY recommend!",5,26/06/2023
Where are All my orders ! The delivery of goods that we have to pay for first is not on .I have made several orders now and only received a couple one of which was delivered next door on her doorstep with a photo of her front door on my phoneI .she was not in but I was ! but I wasn't quite quick enough to catch him before he left.that one was not temu s fault it was Evrie's .where do we complain and ask if we are going to get the order or not .is there a phone No .or  I shall not be ordering any more,1,27/06/2023
"I have been using Temu for almost a year now and I find it exceptional value for money, especially for household items. There is a wide selection of items available. Initially, I used to have problems with deliveries so I resorted to getting my items delivered to a collection point which works out very well for me.The items are very well packed but it's worth paying attention to the measurements provided on household items as many tend to be smaller than one expects. Most of the clothes are made from polyester which I avoid. Many of the electronic items I have purchased have either been of poor quality or don't last long though a friend of mine has had the opposite experience.  The reviews on Temu are often unreliable. The returns process is smooth as well and I cannot fault the customer service. I think it's a great place to shop.",4,27/06/2023

"Avoid!Missing item in my bag after discussing this with 3 different operator and send cctv proof of me opening the bag etc?€? they still did not agree to a refund or a replacement! So the basic behind it?€?s simple, you can pay and they can send you an empty bag, and don?€?t get replacement or refund for it! Shame on you, you should not be allow to trade in a modern country!",1,27/06/2023
"I have ordered twice now, mostly cables, clips, kitchen stuff etc. and i'm extremely satisfied so far.

"I recently ordered two cotton zipper hoodies for my son. One was the correct order and the other was not. When I returned the incorrect item unopened with the explanation I was refused a refund twice stating that I had sent back the wrong item and that the company had sent me the correct one. I wonder how I received a beige hoodie without zipper instead a black one with zipper if the company had sent me the correct one. The problem now is that it is all automated and I can't contact customer service directly via email. So now I am left with one hoodie for the price of two. This is my last time shopping with temu.I received an email from temu with a link to contact them and give them another chance to improve their service. Unfortunately the link took me to a robotic chat with "" customer service"" which informed me that my case of refund had been closed. It is impossible to get a human to explain my problem to or contact them via email. Their customer service is extremely disappointing to say the least.                                                    I must give an update on my previous poor review. At last I was able to communicate with a customer service rep who was extremely helpful and addressed my complaint by getting my money refunded. If I had been able to communicate with an actual person rather than a robot I believe this matter could have been resolved much earlier.",5,27/06/2023
Wosrt shopping experience ever.Items take more thatln 2 weeks to arrive and items are missing in the package.They deceive the custand fool the customer.Temu should be banned immediately not a good and trusted site at all.Refunding the amount doesn't solve the problem when you have not delivered what you show on the site,1,27/06/2023

"I got Better than expected! I didn't expect great quality when i made my first order but was pleasantly surprised with what i got for my money. Ignore the RRP prices as they seem to fluctuate as much as the reductions, its what you actually pay that counts, and free shipping. Yes it takes a while to come but no different to ordering from Ebay direct from China! I'm on my fifth order now.... choose carefully and wisely, get what you need and view from cheapest to more expensive to get the best price. 5 stars as so far, i'm a happy Temu shopper! :)",5,28/06/2023

"I have been ordering from Temu for over a year. I have always been happy with my orders. If there was anything that did not fit, or was not what we expected, we were able to return it. You almost never have to return it to the company. Most of the time they tell you to keep it and donate it to someone else. I had 4 heaters that were broken in transit. They asked me to return them. I boxed them up and returned them to Temu, at their expense. Their products are quality. Some of the items can be found on Amazon. If you look at most of your belonging, you will find that they are made in China. I will continue to shop with Temu. Every time a package arrives, it is like Christmas. Thank you for providing quality merchandise at decent prices.",5,28/06/2023
I can?€?t fault them. I?€?ve bought quite a few pieces of clothing for both myself and husband and always been impressed with the quality for the price.  A couple of times I?€?ve had an item that was not the correct size but refund was given within a few days.  My only concern was that with so many people buying from temu I may bump into someone with the same outfit.  This actually happened at Christmas but I just congratulated the other person on their good taste,5,28/06/2023

I bought 2 dresses for my grand daughter that claimed to be 100% linen dresses but I beg to differ. The material does not feel like it is good quality at all. The dresses dont even look decent enough to be worn. The price paid as well as the taxes were absolutely ridiculous. I could have bought 3 dresses at zara and still had change for shoes.,1,28/06/2023
"I'm addicted to shopping with this company. :( I mainly buy crafting items, sometimes clothes, and although you can get better quality items elsewhere, their prices can't be beaten.I've had one or two very minor issues, such as the odd item not as it should be, or very occasionally a missing item, but considering how much I've bought over the past few months, I have no complaints whatsoever. I just wish I could stop! :D",5,28/06/2023
Spoke to a horrible lady (job) today who kept over talking me and insisting there were no issues despite me reporting the issues over 300 times and asking for my refund and compensation.

Company call and Philippines understand of English.,1,28/06/2023
"I love Temu, the good: free shipping on 25.00 which is easy to reach. Great prices, some items identical to Amazon but way less. Most good quality for price. Great communication on tracking shipment. The Bad: Many items cannot be shipped to my address, like sheet sets, some dresses, many items. Impossible to get a hold of any real person for an answer as to why?? Bots don't answer.",5,28/06/2023
"All was well until I had to return items (clothes that were the wrong size). I live in Tenerife and apparently I was the first to have to return items. Since their return labels are invalid at the post office.After months talking to chat agents and through several  complaints tickets, nothing changed. Tickets were closed without solutions and with empty promises.Because the return period was ending and because I was already at the post office 5 times without being able to ship the boxes, I decided to ship on my own cost. The packages have been marked as delivered. One package has been partly refunded, but only after again contacting support. Second package has not been received according to Temu. However tracking status indicated as delivered. All return requests have been canceled by Temu, 60% of my items have not been refunded. Temu also promised to refund the shipping extra costs. But of course now they ignore any communication from my side.Currently starting legal action against Temu for fraud, theft and breaking European consumer protection regulations.",1,28/06/2023

Ordered a number of items weeks ago and waited patiently for delivery. Got plenty of emails telling me where my items were and they were eventually at the EVRI hub waiting to be sent out for delivery. Should have come today but just been informed that they are missing and I have no choice but to apply for a refund. I needed those items and am extremely dissappointed,1,29/06/2023
"I've ordered many, many things from Temu and have been pleased with everything. Those that complain about the ""garbage"" Temu sells don't read the descriptions: They are very accurate and thorough, complete with dimensions. I've never had a problem with the quality of goods I bought from Temu at a fraction of the cost of other shopping sites. Oftentimes, the quality is much better than I expected. The one complaint I have is with the couriers they use: Straightship and UniUni. There are dozens and dozens of complaints of drivers dropping packages on random doorsteps, taking a picture as ""proof of delivery,"" then stealing the package. Same thing happened to me when Temu used Straightship. Temu issued me a full refund, however, when I assured them the house in the picture was not mine. But, now I'm reluctant to order again, knowing they use these loathesome couriers and my order may not arrive again. It was great that Temu issued a prompt refund, but what I really wanted was my order.UPDATE: I contacted Temu (which isn't easy), and they blacklisted both Straightship and UniUni from my account. My orders are now sent via Canada Post and I have had NO difficulties at all since. Not only that, but shipping is faster, too. For that, I'm adding a star.",4,29/06/2023
"I have spent a lot of money with Temu  a lot of it is cheap stocking fillers for xmas.It's absolute heaven for good stocking fillers. I've bought t.shirts and hoodies from them both for me and grandsons. Sizes are always spot on, material always good not thin and wishy washy, made extremely well. Anything that is a bit iffy I just write off anyway considering the price but in general I have found the quality and price of all their goods to be extremely good. Expect to get what you pay for and you will, I'm sure be very happy.",5,29/06/2023
"Fist experience with Temu puts me off for good, the package was sent with one item missing , contacted the admin, was told to ask for a refund, and if that will be approved I can buy the item again, however the item now tripled, and that?€?s quite disgusting?€?plus why should I asked for a refund when I kindly asked them to sent the missing item, however I felt that I all fell on deaf ears, they suck and I will never buy from them.",1,29/06/2023
Please do not use this company I cancelled an order they put the money in my account and took it out my account the next day I had been arguing with them for months first they say they?€?re paying me back and now they?€?re saying that there must have been fraud on the line and go to my bank my bank has told me not to use this company they don?€?t know what they?€?re on about they clearly put the money in and took it back so please do not use this company,1,29/06/2023
Just bought a camera linse through the Temu platform which seemed qualitywise fine but unfortunately proved incompatible with my Canon camera.Was returned the same day and here 3 days later I have received a 100% refund into my account. Easy and no hazzle.Good service and builds confidence.,4,29/06/2023
What a waste of time and money... the few items that actually showed up were very poor quality and most items did not show up... customer support was friendly but did nothing... I will never use them again... save yourself a headache and don't bother... in reply to Temu... I did contact support twice about this and spent well over an hour trying to sort this out and got no where... also you cannot request a refund until after everything has arrived... again... Temu is a waste of time and money... luckily I paid with PayPal and have put a refund request in with PayPal as I can't be bothered with Temu anymore... I'd give less than 1 star if I could.,1,29/06/2023

The attempt to  investigate this via on-line help page was continually unsuccessful, I contacted the customer service CHAT and after over an hour my order was still not found. It is advertised as an Australian company, however they address given is DUBLIN. I am very sceptical of ever seeing my order as well as loosing my money and faith in on-line shopping!",1,29/06/2023
"Temu has some really great deals on lots of cool stuff. Every time I shop their website for something, I find a bunch of other items that I didn't even know I needed! I've seen LOTS of the same items on Temu as on Amazon (also made in China) but for a fraction of the price that Amazon charges. Very reliable -- I receive tracking numbers & shipping updates regularly from Temu for all orders and their customer service is on it -- they provide refunds or site credits (your choice) if anything is unsatisfactory. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because Temu needs to choose a different delivery carrier. The service they primarily seem to use is called Uni Uni and they are terrible, which is a lose-lose for us as customers AND for Temu, as Uni Uni's terrible service is reflecting badly on them and costing them money to refund customers for lost packages! Otherwise, I highly recommend shopping on Temu.",4,29/06/2023

This website/app is golden.I started off with pet stuff, cheap jewellery and household items, now venturing into the clothes and baby department.

Highly recommend Temu.",5,29/06/2023
I have used temu for a while now and had no issues but I believe there is a lawsuit against them now stating that they have access to everything on your phone and can hack into your details. I would be happy with a reply to this with answers to the lawsuit. This is not a bad review as i've never had any problems with Temu it's just that my daughter has said there's a lawsuit against yourselves about the app. The app can get access to your phone and what is on your phone. This is all I want clearing up whether it is true or not many thanks as I say I have never had any problems,5,29/06/2023
"It's not possible to use the credit balance on the temu app when checking out to buy products. There's no such an option at checkout, it only takes you to the Bank or PayPal. So, how am i supposed to used my funds? I have received an email from trust pilot also threatening to delete my review. I had to come back here to give more details. First anytime you buy from temu countercheck with your bank or PayPal. More money is deducted than the cost of goods. Prices escalate when you have put items in the basket and you end up paying more than the original price. Of course i have bought a few good things but that for me seems like sheer luck because of all the other bad experiences and ridiculous items. There's a catch! Always check on your bank transfer details and thank me later.",1,29/06/2023

They give no help whatsoever, the only time they actually go lengthy is when they see a good review I really don't get this.Their customers have issues at least they should try give good solutions to the issues instead of vague robot replies this simply informs me as a new client that they are not to be trusted with customers services. So I'm really not convinced Timu is a place I'd shop. There's nothing comforting about them handling queries or helping their customers with bad experience.",1,30/06/2023
"I spin the wheel  get $50 prize and then when I did my order it didn't take it off the total its a scam they use to give your money vouchers to use not no more I'm happy with the return system or the credit on faulty or  missing items but I would love to talk to a person instead of the computer i have spent $50,000  with them and I have never received a free item be carefull",2,30/06/2023
Tried to resolve issue with temu but all their chats are operated by chatbots that are incapable of answering any straight forward question. they are also incapable of responding to insults. all they do is make matters worse than what they are. Temu staff are litterally fraudsters and scammers. You can never talk to a real person and when they say they will escalate and issue to a supervisor which they actually claim they are the email you get is actually from the same chatbot.,1,30/06/2023
"Placed an order which claimed it was processed and locked up the funds in my bank via Paypal. Then went on to find out the order hadn't placed and it now couldn't process as the funds were locked. Spoke to an agent and they said ""sorry wait 3-6 days and try again or find alternative funding"", so i was told to pay more money for the same order to process again. No sympathy or genuine apology. They think we're made of money and can just pay double for an order.",1,30/06/2023

I find that the quality of some items are outstanding. Especially art stuff and sewing tools. It is so exciting to receive my parcel,5,30/06/2023
Very bad service. My two parcels are lost. EVRI parcel company is their company to deliver parcel in UK. We are really frustrated and will never trust Temu now!! No Customer service and no updates from EVRI.,1,30/06/2023
"I am in South Africa. It is the first time I buy from TEMU, I have always used Shein and I have had a very bad experience now with TEMU.I made a small purchase of R820 and to my BIG SURPRISE Buffalo (Customs) charged me R453, more than 50% in taxes, when I complained to Buffalo for this immorality they responded that they charge the Tax for the original Price which was R1250 NOT the price that I paid on SALE R820, this Buffalo/TEMU behavior is an absolute THEFT, it is a mocking Consumer Deception, it is an immeasurable lack of respect for the Consumers of South Africa.I just wish TEMU/BUFFALO would answer this question for me.Has only South Africa/AFRICA had this complaint?I will present Complaints and Evidence to all possible Platforms and Instances, I have only started here.",1,30/06/2023
"While I have had some good experiences with temu, there is also a down side. I bought two 64GB sd cards ready for my hols. To my disapointment they were rubbish, mostly corrupt files. I have had the sd cards checked professionally since, just in case it was my camera, it wasnt. the cards are 32GB at best but there were so many write errors on the cards the files were useless. Please be wary when buying such items, its not just the cost but Memories and more.",1,30/06/2023
Placed order 22/3/24 and still not received. Keep getting emails from Evri saying they have my package so why not deliver it?I have since found what I want from Dunelm so don?€?t need this order anymore. Never ordered from Temu before and wish I hadnt,1,30/06/2023
I would give them a 5 star but I?€?m fed up with being bombarded with stupid offers silly games and hundred actual I?€?ve 1000 messages Why is it not possible to go onto the site a just buy something Please please give me a way of getting rid of all the sales rubbish I have bought a few times and have been happy with the items bought Added I don?€?t think you get what I am saying !!!,1,01/07/2023
Temu is very good on service and certain goods however I have been burnt a few times by some of the electronics.Namely ear buds. I tried to review on Temu but could not as the items were discontinued. The make was True Wireless and of the 2 I bought neither worked. Neither had any weight and I suspect they were just the plastic outer casing without the Electronics. They cost ??4 plus ??6 respectively. I will see if I can get a refund - Temu are quite good about this aspect.,2,01/07/2023

"I have an excellent experience with Temu.  I brought lots of things since I opened my account. However a few things are poor quality, most of them are excellent!  I've had a lot of discounts, and I won 3 times the fish game and farm game, so I received  a lot of free items.  In one occasion Evry delivered my parcel to the wrong address.  Temu immediately refunded it (more than ??100).  I've send back few items and they were refunded quickly.  Items that arrived damaged were refounded immediately.  The only problem is to control myself, because I always find fabulous offers.",5,01/07/2023

"Not only do they send damaged, used items, but they also place random charges on your card. So, I had to close my card and ensure never to buy from them again. When I contacted them, they acted like I was lying, even though I had proof. Don't trust this company.*****UPDATE*****Temu never takes anything seriously.  I've been fighting with them for months and the just send out a prefilled reply.  DONT TRUST THIS COMPANY. WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!!!",1,01/07/2023
"I was happy with the overall functioning of the company until I came to know about its vast sale of sex toys and products on an unimaginable scale through its website. And more frustrating it becomes when the age appropriateness is defined as 4-year-olds. It was shocking to find all those products on my 9-year-old son's tablet where we had adjusted all the age requirements.Isn't it considered mental abuse to a kid when you represent all those products and images on your website under the age category of 4 years old? Have you company guys ever been a parent? Or have you ever tried to raise a decent kid in such an era of obscene scenery? If yes, then you know what I mean by writing you this review.",1,01/07/2023
"First of all, if you haven't used app yet make sure to enter the reward coupon?? ach998435 ?? on the sign upscreen to get a $100 bonus! I have spent about $150 so far on Temu. I have loved everything so far except for one thing and I have probably bought 30 items. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of most things. Some were better than others but for the price I sure can't complain. I will be back for sure. You can't lose even if one thing turns out not so great because it is so inexpensive. The shipping is fast for what is probably coming from over seas. maybe a week or little more. They will text you a lot of times with updates on your order so you are never left in the dark wondering where your package is. I love getting a deal so Temu is my kind of place to shop. I recommend looking around on the site for the best deal because many times they will have it cheaper from a different seller I suppose because there are multiples of similar items. They also send you coupons sometimes. If you have friend who you can sign up you can get a lot of free stuff but l didn't want to bother anyone. I like to wait til they send me a coupon to place an order. Try it you will like it. Warning most the time when they offer free gifts you are going to have to get friends to sign up and you will play games to get the points then you will need more points to win and you will need friends to sign up to actually win the prizes you have!!",5,01/07/2023

They will tell you the have confirmed withbtheir warehouse that all otems were packed. Why would i care of it was packed or not, if DONT EVEN receive the package???They just copy and paste a pre-written message and say nope no refund no help F U.. SCAMMERS",1,01/07/2023

"I love Temu so much! I find great deals, and on top of that, I get great discounts. Some products vary in quality, so I usually look at people who post pictures of the items they get before I purchase. Shipping is super fast, and communication is great.",5,01/07/2023
"I think this site is absolutely brilliant, great products at hugely discounted prices, can find almost anything with some brilliant storage ideas, the very cheap clothes aren?€?t brilliant but for around the house great, there slightly more expensive stuff is great and are still less than half price of retailers plus free delivery and returns.. fantastic, I?€?ve been using them about a year now and never a problem, I don?€?t normally write reviews but I?€?ve heard so many rumours about this site being a scam etc it most definitely is not, it?€?s obviously the competition sites starting these very false rumours",5,02/07/2023
"this is definitely one of the worst buying app ever , this is by far so much worse then shein , they support genocide and they STEAL bank information now this has not happened to me but if you search up ?€? temu bank account ?€? it should pop up but anyways they basically steal a little bit money from your account every week (around 10$) and just keep on doing it , the girl whose money got taken out of her account contacted her bank and they tried to track whoever stole her money but temu uses some kind of vpn so you cant find the person so she basically just lost hundreds and didn?€?tget anything back and the person did not face ANY consequences??? This is crazy idont recommend this app at all , ive also ordered from there and they come broken? i orderedthere once and it was definitely not an experience worth living agian fuc this app",1,02/07/2023
"In general my experience with Temu has been really positive, orders ship fairly quickly and there is good tracking information. Having bought many products (in the 00's ), there are bound to be the odd product that is not up to scratch - but in the main they are as described.Points to watch are;1 - Read the advert properly, the picture may depict one of the higher spec items - but the lowest price might be for an item of lower specification. I fell foul of this when I purchased a roll of tape, finding out when it was delivered I had inadvertently ordered the 1m roll and not the 10m roll - my bad!2 - Make sure that the displayed items are what you want, as sometimes things like a change of colour also means a change of sytle. Happened when I bought a pair of boots - guess what my bad!Why only four stars, well as you have to buy everything through the website - the site is a little confusing. Other than that I have found little to complain about, the prices are excellent and the free shipping is a plus - it's why I've used them for the past four years.",4,02/07/2023
The communication about product dispatch and delivery were very good. The products were as expected for the money paid.,4,02/07/2023
products are good however the timeframe for delivery is ridiculous! It?€?s better to pay more and get faster shipping!,3,02/07/2023
"I have ordered many things from Temu, maybe 20 or more orders.  They have all been accurate and only two were a day late for which I was paid $5. I ordered two of something and they immediately refunded one to my card.  I have been very pleased with what I have received. The only caveat to that is some of their clothes are made with a cheap fabric I do not like.  They are upfront about the sizes of everything and are easily tracked. I get constant updates. I can't see what anyone could complain about that is the truth.  I was initially hesitant to try Temu because there are so many Chinese scam sites, but I was glad I did.  At times I have seen the same items on amazon for twice the price or more. Exactly the same.",5,02/07/2023

All I have got are nonsensical replies unrelated to my issue and still no refund from them after 2 weeks.",1,02/07/2023
No trust on them they are just trying to get much people on it as possible promo r fake to get people sign up there is no way we can put review about your promotion offers that's why I put this review here so people can know your tricks no option for review in app I am not complaining about an order for me to give trust pilot or temu a reference number am complaining about its offers there should options for us to say what we think about its offer but when we click it only says about rules no options for writing review,1,02/07/2023
Forgive me for lacking depth but Temu appears to be the best thing ever. One week delivery to Ireland is incredible. Perfect for all the little bits. I hope it lasts. Like aliexpress but without the fraud (so far).,5,02/07/2023
"Have to say I am impressed, however a lot of the items I have ordered are clearly cheaply made ,but on the other hand some of the items are great value, the app really needs to stop you from having to jump through so many hoops to order stuff tho ,can be hard work sometimes ,it's like what they say ""ya get what ya pay for"" .",4,02/07/2023
"I bought quite a lot of items from Temu, however, not all items working as expected.When I left some 1-star reviews, I was never able to find my review when I checked the product in the browser's private mode.So my conclusion is, buy with your risk, and never consider their reviews valid.",2,02/07/2023

Avoid Temu it?€?s a scam. They will confirm receiving your return Then deny the recieve and they won?€?t refund. If yu want to be conned buy fro Temu. The best cheating company. Read their reviews. They are not even ashamed. Thiefs. Pls AVOID!!! Guys it?€?s a high time Temu should face the law. They have conned people enough,1,02/07/2023
No orde confirmation so impossible to follow up order. Also price of items very hard to pin down with so many discounts being applied. I decided I wouldn?€?t spend money with Temu that I couldn?€?t afford to just lose. Deleted app to remove temptation,3,02/07/2023

With very few exceptions they have been good quality and, considering how much is made in China they are delivered within a reasonable time and free of delivery costs.

"Well I was really dubious about using this company, reviews not very encouraging, but I wanted a cheap harness for my puppy (not worth paying a lot as he?€?s still growing). Saw one on Temu for about ??3 so thought I would give it a go, not a lot of money to lose but I was really surprised. Ordering on line was very easy and i was advised of the order process and delivery progress at every stage. The goods Arrived in due course, as advised and whilst the harness isn?€?t fantastic, it will be more than adequate for the length of time it will be used for. I also ordered a bed for the dog crate, very pleased with the quality, not thin and equivalent to what  uk websites are asking three times the price for. Overall, very happy with the transaction and may use again if I need something cheap and cheerful.",5,03/07/2023
"I've been shopping on Temu since January 2023. I've been able to get family members more than one gift for birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, which was great until they went up on the S & H fee. It was $10, $15, and now $20. A lot of their products have gone up as well. I'm glad I got the things I needed for a fraction of the cost. Because of that, I haven't purchased anything for a while because of how high everything is getting. It was a fun ride while it lasted.",3,03/07/2023

Fair enough. Products get here quick. Upper my 3 star to 4 and happy to confirm Temu is real and the kit is as described and if you have probs with it, cust service is real also.

"3rd update: after almost 3 weeks of having a ticket created for the issue of the missing items they still refuse to give the refunds for the two rings and the SD card. They did reword it and give me the credit for the two rings which was a dollar and something but they did not actually say it was for refund they said they were just crediting my account because  of issues I was having but they still denied the refund for the SD card that was missing. I contacted two other people at two different times on their chat and the second one seen the issues that I was having understood the issue I was having and actually gave me credit on my account for the SD card but the claim on their ticket was still denied for a refund for missing item so just be careful always take pictures of your packages especially if they have holes or damage to them where anything that you order could fall out of it always document it before you even open it I myself take pictures and video of every bag or item I receive before opening before bringing it into my home and as I'm opening it if it does have holes I videotape open it and the items that I pull out.2nd UPDATE: so I contacted TEMU customer service like they said and have once again been told the same thing.. ""The items was in bag when shipped and package was in good shape. So we are not replacing and refunding you for your missing items."" I have never claimed the items was not sent I am pretty sure the small items fell out of the holes that was In the DELIVERY BAG before I received it. Shopping hint ALWAYS TAKE PICTURES OF YOUR DELIVERY PACKAGE BEFORE YOU OPEN IT IF IT IS DAMAGED. ( JUST FOR REFERENCE my family is very loyal customers at this very moment my family has between 22 and 25 orders they are waiting on from TEMU. Temu messages me through Trustpilot and ask me to contact them through live chat, which i have done 3 times about this issue with the only thing happening is to tell me items was in bag when shipped so I will not be getting replacements or refund/credit for items I ordered. AS OF RIGHT NOW I requested a refund for 4th time on the 3 items missing, waiting to be reviewed. Will update when it's resolved.)My family orders from Temu on a weekly basis, and for the most part everything is a good experience. This situation is from my kids email as we let them order things but it is my name on order because I'm the one paying for. Then there are times like this one where I receive an order with a hole in the delivery bag and missing items from my order. This time they sent 3 different orders in one package, because I received my package with a hole in the delivery bag 3 items was lost out of my orders, 2 rings from one order and a micro SD card from another.I have talk to 3 different people on chat at Temu only to be told the same thing, ""THE ITEMS WAS IN THE BAG WHEN IT LEFT THE WAREHOUSE SO WE CAN NOT HELP YOU, YOU NEED TO CONTACT THE DELIVERY COMPANY. Which was the first thing I done. THE DELIVERY COMPANY DID NOT DENY THE PACKAGE BEING DAMAGED AND ALSO SAID THAT TEMU WOULD FILE A CLAIM WITH THEM FOR THE ITEM THAT WAS LOST. ITS NOT ETHICAL THAT I JUST DON'T GET THE ITEMS THAT ARE MISSING FROM MY ORDERS BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE TO THE PACKAGE AS TO WHERE ITEMS COULD FALL OUT OF IT. NOW TEMU SAYS IF AN ITEMS WENT MISSING DURING PACKING OR TRANSPORTATION TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR A REFUND. That is from their terms on missing items. So my package missing 3 items, lost because of the damage, I just do NOT get a replacement or refund/credit for the items I ordered and paid for! Photos was also sent during my chats of the package showing the hole before package was even opened, as I've had this problem before so I now take photos of ALL DAMAGED packages before opening.",1,03/07/2023

Trashy people buying from a very manipulative company using others images of more expensive items, WHICH IS SO OBVIOUSLY DISGUSTING AND DISRESPECTFUL TO THE buyer. Do you need to buy if it is cheap?There?€?s so much secondhand goods/resources being thrown into landfill and you fresh babies have to buy more.

"I have been quite surprised to see some very negative reviews of this company.My experience has been very different. Items have been as described, in fact much better at times. In the main delivery times have been less than a fortnight, sometimes less than a week.I have been disabled and trapped, bedridden at home for the past four years. Temu has allowed me to enjoy shopping and indulge myself - getting back to the person I used to be. Surgery and the prospect of a prosthesis means that, hopefully, I can get out and enjoy my life as I wish The Temu site has helped enormously to alleviate depression with their beautiful and useful product's at such amazingly low prices. My only complaint, if I had one, is that the site is so addictive - I tell myself I'll just browse and the next thing I know is that I find something absolutely  irresistible.Thank you Temu. You helped change my life for the better.",5,04/07/2023

"UPDATE 3/29/24:  My package arrived to my home with the proper name and address. It arrived on time and in good condition. I really like this man's crossbody chest bag.I re-evaluated and went from one star to four stars. However, not five stars because of the fake, illegal text message sent to my phone, supposedly by the United States Postal Service. It had proprietary information about me and the package's arrival to Orlando.I'm not the only complainer about receiving text messages about a bad address. It happens a lot. So, how are they getting the information?Instead of TEMU just saying beware, I think they would want to find out how customers' private information is getting out and stop it?Original post 3/26/24:Received bogus text supposedly from the USPS saying they received package in Orlando, FL, from TEMU but did not have proper address.Here is the text:  ""The USPS package has arrived at the warehouse and cannot be delivered due to incomplete address information. Please confirm your address in the link within 12 hours.(Trustpilot restricted me from using the actual fake link in this review. It was here.)(Please reply to Y, then exit the SMS, open the SMS activation link again, or copy the link to Safari browser and open it)The US Postal team wishes you a wonderful day.""My security software stopped me from contacting the above address. No security certificate - possibly fraudulent address.I contacted the Postal Inspector's office. After some time they did respond and that is not their address. They will investigate the malfeasance of using fake USPS communications on the Internet.For me, impossible to contact Temu by phone or Internet. I called my bank and disputed the charge for nondelivery and bogus illegal text.They seem legitimate, respond to negative reviews on Trustpilot and even advertise on Trustpilot. What I suspect is happening, is that Temu, like Amazon, signs up suppliers from China. However, some suppliers are fraudulent, possibly criminal enterprises. So, two thirds of orders are legitimate and consummated and one third are fraudulent.Good luck with your order and ""And may the odds be ever in your favor.""",4,04/07/2023

"I used to think TEMU were much better than all the negative press about them, but I have now changed my mind. I recently got some coupons from them. The lowest was spend ??5.01 and get ??5.00 back. However, the ??15.00 minimum spend at checkout still applied, so really you have to spend ??20.00 to get ??5.00 off.  If I spent ??15.01 at checkout it automatically applied a ??10.00 coupon, which then took the total at checkout to below ??15.00! I managed to get the total checkout to exactly ??15.00 and it still applied the ??10.00 coupon! There was no way I could find to override it back to the ??5.00 coupon. So, the reality is that I was never going to be able to use the ??5.00 coupon (and presumably all the other coupons up to the final, highest spend one?) I have never had this issue before with using coupons. I had already spent a lot of time trying different things but in the end I just cancelled my order; I am not interested in buying from a company when I suspect that they are trying to hoodwink me into spending more.

"The promotions are misleading/scummy, and some of the stuff they do to get newcomers to come in is pretty fishy. I was worried about data privacy issues, but I can't find any evidence of it doing anything different from American companies. If you're using Amazon, for example, you might as well find cheaper alternatives here because the quality and practices of the former are practically the same. If you're concerned, use the website and PayPal as your purchase method. That being said, I can't really complain about my actual shopping experience. I've only bought small-ticket items (stationery in the form of journals, stickers, etc.), but I've had a positive experience when it comes to the actual purchasing experience. Shipping was fast (1-2 weeks), and all of my orders arrived in relatively good condition. The quality of other items can be a hit or a miss, and I'd avoid purchasing beauty products for obvious reasons, but as long as you do your research, you'll get exactly what you're expecting.",4,07/07/2023

"Ive been buying off Temu for a very long time and always found them very obliging when something isnt to my satisfaction theyve refunded the money and if a parcel isnt delivered on time...i always found $20 minimum purchase to be really affordable for myself as im not allowed to work anymore and not old enough for pension so on a very limited income the price was perfect for me.. But, then the minimum purchase went up to $35 with free shipping, not so long ago, with no option for cheaper with paying for shipping, then i look again to order today and its gone up another $5 making it $40.00 for minimum purchase with free shipping in a short time its doubled... Im deleting the app now for good... Maybe it will come down again and i will reinstall or maybe i will just order from wish if i need anything...

"Temu sells Landfill.I swore off buying disposable toys from the dollar store many years ago because they all ended up in the garbage a few moments after opening.  The prices I see at Temu for the products advertised against the Adds crammed through my eyes said this place and their products is a scam.  I negotiate honesty and commitment as a career so I know a good deal when I see one.  Temu is NOT a good deal ! I made two separate purchases from Temu to test them out and this is what I found.  Half of my packages looked like it was drop-kicked across the warehouse a couple times.  I followed their pressure sales tactic and bought 7 items to ""get three free""  My cart was $130CAD.  I made a second order a day later for a similar priced cart with a few things that I could likely use as toys for my 4 year old if they were poor quality.  My suspicions held true.  My son has some new toys that he will likely break by mid summer and I don't care because I cant use the products because of their poor quality.  The C- rating from the BBB is far too generous; there needs to be a rating of F- (worse than fail). I give them a grade of 20% for satisfaction. It is the production and filling of garbage dumps with this junk that is contributing to global warming.  Hopefully the buying frenzy generated by their advertising dies off soon. It's not worth my time and effort to return this stuff because I did receive the toys I expected them to be.",1,07/07/2023

"******UPDATE******You asked me to update it so there is my answer. First of all, you sent a stand reply which does not cover the problem I encountered. The order wasn't lost or damaged ( although it did stank of fish for some weird reason). The problem was that I didn't ask you send it to some random shop. Your customers service wouldn't let me change the delivery address even though the order had not be dispatched yet and the shop asked me to come back 4 TIMES before finally realising the order. The total experience was a shamble. As you are the one picking the delivery company (Evri) and apparently now the delivery address, I consider you responsible. So no more orders. Full stop.I placed quite a few orders in recent months and was happy with it until I placed a very large order and to my surprise they decided to send it to some random shop rather that my address as per previous orders. I've tried to rectify the delivery address but was told is wasn't possible even though the order wasn't even prepared for dispatch yet. Now both packages have arrived to this random shop and I've tried to collect THREE TIMES but they keep telling me their system is down and to come back later. This smells like a scam to me, either from Temu or from the friend shop but if I don't get my expensive order TODAY, someone is going to be reported for FRAUD. Tried to sort it with Evri ( other scam company) but they won't help either. I was quite happy ordering with Temu until this happened so in future I'll go back to Amazon, at least I have no problems there.",2,08/07/2023

I was hesitant to buy at first with them being new but I got the app and placed an order and I loved everything in my order so much so that I have now placed another order. I saved so much money and we should support companies like these. I saved hundreds of dollars and they have everything to choose from! You really can shop like a billionaire!,5,08/07/2023
sold my soul,1,08/07/2023
Temu took my money time and time they cancelled my order then they just didn't repay me they tried to blame it on Google pay I would not recommend this web site to my worst enemy I've been trying to put an order through since January 15 well I guess that 100dollars out of my pocket,1,08/07/2023

pretty satisfied with purchase don't like the idea that they send doubles and then can't get them on a phone to get credit when I send the extra stuff back. I'm really getting mad,4,08/07/2023
"I bought many cheap items that they were described useful and good quality reviews but when I receive them notice they were useless with poor quality materials.  Return the items to temu is not easy,  also they bombarded me with hundreds of messages and emails on daily basis and it was very enjoyable,  I decided to terminate the account for peace of mind,  and stopped wasting my money on rubbish items.  I don't recommend anyone to use Temu.",1,08/07/2023
"i bought about 20 products from Temu, about 90% of products are of very good quality",5,08/07/2023
"I was so sceptical about Temu but since buying their products, I'm 100% on board. Over this past six months I've spent hundreds of pounds but saved considerably more. Their products are amazing quality, regardless of how cheap they are. The clothes are beautiful, I have a complete new wardrobe. Their kitchen & homeware products are incredible, space saving, energy saving & just amazing gadgets that make cooking so much easier. I definitely recommend them ??????",5,08/07/2023
"This company's pricing policy is dishonest!  I even had proof and their "" team"" didn't acknowledge the screen shots.  I will never buy from them again!  The prices drastically dropped within a week.Buyer beware! I now see that Temu that you responded.  Now after an hour of waiting to see what your ""team"" could do they didn't look at the proof that I provided( screen shots) and now you would like to revisit it?!",1,08/07/2023
I?€?m losing about 70 chf because temu claims an order has been delivered when it hasn?€?t. About 6 packages haven?€?t arrived and about 6 have in 2024. I sent photos showing how the package isn?€?t in the parcel area / PO Box. But all they can say is that the package has been delivered (no proof offered). Even the live agent won?€?t propose a solution and would just say no with automated messages. STOP using temu it is not worth the risk when they deal with missing packages like this. They are also refusing to return remaining temu credits to my credit card.,1,08/07/2023
"Ordered a smart watch after being bombarded with ads, decided to purchase one and several other items costing ??11 in total.

Love the watch. highly recommend. Thanks Temu ????",5,08/07/2023

I check my cctv along with 3 other neighbours my parcel wasn't delivered at all! I contact evri they confirm that the parcel has intact been lost and they've taken full responsibility for this (got this in email to support this to temu) I've contacted temu for the last 21 days about this and each time they've told me my parcel was delivered correctly, so they won't be refunding me or reshipping despite having all this proof it wasn't in fact delivered! I spent alot of money with them for my parcel to not arrive and not be refunded! Avoid!!!!",1,09/07/2023

"Horrendous service and refusal of refund of missing items even though video proof and photo proof has been issued to them of the damaged packed delivered to me, on the video doorbell footage it clearly shows the the damaged/open split to the package in the delivery persons hand so they 100% know and can see for them selves that it arrived like that to, but just keep saying to me that the items were sent and package was was in good condition when sent.

"Have tried to return items to them to which they have had my items in their warehouse (which is tracked as being there)   They state that once there it is inspected and a refund will happen between 1 to 5 days.Its been longer than 2 weeks that my items have been there with no sign of refund.Spoke to customer service twice to which each time tried to tell my that my item was in transit and not in warehouse to which they both backtracked when I pointed out the tracking. Each telling me to wait multiple times for the items to be inspected. I ask if I can speak to someone else that may be able to get in contact with warehouse. No reply. Constantly going round in loops of being told to wait without giving me any idea of how long it may be on hold forBasically withholding temu credit and my money from me as they have the returned items. Never known customer service like thisThe items in question, one blew an electrical fault and basically exploded, another didn't work as it should and the other didn't suit its purpose so in a way please be wary of Electrical items (Mine were solar panels)Edit-- Still waiting on refunds, please reach out to me via email to resolve and please just refund me, over ??80 worth of refunds awaiting to come back to me Edit 2- Still waiting on refunds, Has been more than 2 weeks and now 4 customer service people have told me its in transit and then backtracked on themselves, will keep updates going until resolved. Temu Response on here has been no help and have had no contact.Edit 3- now have a support ticket- even though items shown tracked back on their system as back at warehouse on the 13th March, they are now accusing me of not sending the item as I have misplaced the tracking number from Evri on my end and they can't find it on their system even though I have had at least 3 online customer chats stating on their end that it's at the warehouse Final Edit- 3 week after sending my items back, support ticket has now refunded me after chasing them up via online chat to ask if they could find my tracking. Support ticket was only updated daily even when I responded straight away to their message.Have given me ??10 Temu credit as compensation for the inconvenience. Due to everything, I now give them a 2 star instead of a 1 as this whole situation could of been handled a lot better if matters were raised sooner and given a support ticket from the start.",2,09/07/2023
IM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH TEMU!! I won lots of stuff by playing their games before they took them all off so I'm extremely happy to see them back on there this morning. I have ordered multiple things off Temu over this last year and only have ever had a couple of issues which got sorted as soon as I messaged them. If you know 3 people or have 3 devices to click your own links you can earn ??40 paypal cash too playing cash rewards which I got. Once you've downloaded the app search the game codes in the normal search bar to find the games. It's worth it even if you can only win once.

"Absolutely appalling and disgusting customer service after care!!!I have had multiple interactions with the customer service team (if you can even call them customer SERVICE!!)And oh my my my!!!! Absolutely no service at all from them. They are absolutely disgusting, so do disrespectful, and obnoxious. I had a package that stated it was delivered, however I never received it. I requested a refund and they came back to me and said, ?€? sorry you didn?€?t get to use your items this time, hopefully next time you will?€? ????And that I will not get a refund because their team ?€? can not prove I didn?€?t receive the package?€?????? Ummmm I?€?m telling you I didn?€?t receive it, and I have paid for over $200 and I get told ?€? too bad?€???? They have a refund policy option for issues such as this, and yes?€?. It does happen!! A delivery can go missing or state that it was delivered but I didn?€?t receive it. It does happen more than you realise. But they will not honour their promises or deliver on their terms and conditions of service that a refund would be provided if this happens. They can?€?t provide proof of delivery, but they expect me to provide proof that i didn?€?t receive it???? Ummm how???? How can I prove I didn?€?t get it??? What a load of nonsense!!!But that is not a problem, fair trading will deal with it. They keep repeating the same msg over and over and over again, and then get rude and nasty when you keep asking for the service you deserve. Well I can see from other reviews, and the responses from Temu that refunds are offered and provided, but it seems that it is only offered once you get on a public platform. Well, I have to say, the service is disgusting and disappointing to say the least. So update?€?. As you can see the reply below from Temu, makes it sound like they are trying to do everything they can to help me and correct the situation, But it?€?s all smoke and mirrors?€? I never heard from them again after this post reply from them, and when I reached out to get a refund, I was yet again told too bad, you can?€?t prove it didn?€?t arrive, so that?€?s too bad. Better luck next time. So don?€?t be fooled by the so called sincerity that may appear to be coming from this post reply, Because once they get you out of the forum, you get the same old standard response, and they refuse to stand by their buyer protection promise program. They claim if you don?€?t receive the order, you will get a refund, well let me tell you?€?.. there is no way they are standing by their policy on this one. Got anything to say TEMU??????",1,10/07/2023
"I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with TEMU's customer service that left me completely disappointed. I had ordered two items: a shirt that unfortunately arrived with numerous typos in the English text printed on it, and a pair of pants that were significantly shorter than the size I had expected. Recognizing these issues, I decided to return both items, carefully packing them together in one package to ensure a smooth return process.After sending the package back, I awaited confirmation from TEMU that my return had been processed. However, to my dismay, the response I received was far from satisfactory. The customer service representative informed me that they had only received one item in the package ?€? the shirt with the mistyped words. This was outright impossible, as I had personally packed both items into the same package before sending it off.I immediately reached out to their customer service to rectify the mistake, expecting a straightforward resolution. Yet, what followed was a series of back-and-forth communications that only added to my frustration. Despite my repeated explanations and assurance that both items were returned together, the response from TEMU was consistently dismissive. They refused to acknowledge the possibility of an error on their end, leaving me without a refund for the second item.This experience has severely impacted my view of TEMU and their approach to customer service. The lack of understanding, accountability, and willingness to resolve a clear issue has been incredibly disheartening. It's a situation that no customer should have to face, especially over something as simple as a return process that should have been easily verified and corrected.",1,10/07/2023

I contacted Temu but they said driver delivered your package in bin and told me  we can?€?t do anything no refund basically told me I?€?m lying. I asked for refund temu customer service told me we can?€?t refund because evri delivered your package in your outside bin.On that day we was out with kids by the time we came home there was no package. I?€?m really disappointed by temus customer service and how they care about customer. All item was for kids present for Christmas.

Temu also does not empower their employees to make business decisions that will resolve the customer's complaints in regards to logistics and this company, On Trac nor Temu has live customer service agents.

"I ordered a package and their robot call centre and delivery network lost my package, Asking for a refund is futile as them wanting to give you their credit option which means you will never get what you put in. My advice if you feel like shopping here, rather throw your money in the bin because that is what you will be doing.",1,12/07/2023
"I have made many orders from Temu. I love to go through the website and look at different things. If you have the app, it's $10 minimum order. If you do not have the app, it's $15 minimum order. I'll be sure all of my orders are $15 and I get free shipping. This last time I ordered I ordered a 98 cent pencil box. In the small print that I missed it said $18 shipping for this one little pencil box. When I checked out it was separated from the rest of the order but I didn't think much of it because I was able to pay for it all at the same time. There was no big print. That said, this was a $18 shipping. !!!!When I contacted the company to cancel this to cancel this.. I was informed that that was the shipping policy for this particular ABDirect. I feel like this is unfair to the consumer. TEMU as a very busy and active website to offer one product at this price without mentioning the $18 shipping when you put it in your cart is unfair. I will be done ordering from Temu. It seems like lately they're adding more and more things to confuse their consumers. I am a highly educated person and yes I did miss the small print. But I do feel like this was done on purpose to confuse consumers.  I am being forced to take the pencil case and eat the shipping cost of $18 for a pencil case that cost 98 cents!All I'm saying is read the small print. Don't let them do this to you. They're refusing my refund. I did nothing but brag about this company to others and how much I love purchasing from them. I've even maxed out a credit card with this company. But I'm going to be buyer. Beware and I'm going to stop purchasing from them. Just be careful folks",1,12/07/2023

"I used to buy massively on Amazon purely because I could not be bothered going shopping in central London, searching for unique items while having to deal with the same rude people one finds in Oxford street for example.  Then I discovered Temu and I placed over a dozen orders in a matter of weeks totalling some 100 items as the prices are anything from 1/10th to 1/2 of the prices you find in Amazon (the sellers there are the same millionaires speaking with impunity on our TV).  I never had one single delivery lost, I can track everything online and most recently I had to return some items due to the Chinese sellers there not being honest and be refunded in less than one week when the items reached the local refund location.  Always reading the reviews of other people advising on the quality of the items, I started writing my reviews with pics/videos, because clothing/shoes can be massively mis-represented by the Chinese sellers not knowing even how to take measurements.  Customer service can be good or just 'copying and paste' sentences from their software when you feel like throwing the computer off the window, but you learn to do other things while they learn 'to type'.  I made the mistake to start playing their Fisland/Farmland etc and I have to give up as they are simply time wasting: you never win anything.  Is just like a typical casino where the house always wins: you spend lots of 'food' you acquire mainly via purchases, while they ask you to also bother your friends to join Temu via social media and get bobs in return as your fingers work days to move from 0.19 to 0.18, then 0.17 closer to get a gift you never use.  It really puts you off.  I will stick to shopping, saving my money and if the standards will go down, then I will stop shopping there too.  Right now is better then Amazon, selling the same items made in China.",5,12/07/2023

"ABSOLUTELY APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE! I ACTUALLY GIVE ZERO STARS! This is the Temu Customer Service telephone number: 020 8103 3187, but beware... they clearly work 'off script' so you are constantly put on hold. They either don't understand you or don't listen. I have spent over 3 hours on the phone over 4 phone calls as I kept getting cut off. I am trying to sort out a refund! I have to repeat myself to every person I speak to! I was told a complaint on my behalf was being sent and I would receive an email with a ticket for this; the complaint has been sent however the email I received does not mention anything about my complaint or the issues I have had!

"Update:I am not sure why Temu gives one order number, and OnTrac gives a different delivery number.  From Temu via email Subject heading:""Re: Re: Your Temu order delivered notification (#PO-211-00322790830710877)""Update:Here is the false notification emailed to me by OnTrac, the postal service used by Temu. A day prior to the false stated 'delivered'' message, OnTrac status stated that the items were at the airport out of my state and had not shipped. It could not arrive the next day""Hello, This is an automated email response from OnTrac. The package tracking number D10014924742477 has been confirmed as delivered. Delivery Name : D SPI POD Signature : LSR-FRONT DOOR Delivery Time : Mar 12 2024 9:32AM Status Code : DELIVERED Reference : BG-2402275CLH7TH4RQ For more information please visit us at our website""Temu's tracking system is a scam. My order never arrived. Order was made Feb 27 2024Scheduled Date For Delivery - Mar 4 Latest Date For Delivery - Mar 9 Tried to Request a Refund on March 11, but their website and their postal service, makes it impossible to speak to a person, and sends the customers in circles by Temu instructing the customer to contact OnTrac with their phone number, and the bot maintained Ontrac system instructs the customer to contact the seller if a notification of ""delivered"" has been received, but in reality there is not package sent or received. Side Note: Odd that a company would have, ""If you received notification for delivery, but did not receive your package"" as a FIRST ""help"" for customers. As though they KNOW that this is going to happen repeatedly to their customers. On Mar 9  OnTrac stated that the package was at the initial airport and yet to be shipped, and a $5 credit for future Temu products ONLY has been added to my account. Problem: I will NEVER use Temu again. The credit is useless to me. On Mar 11 I tried to request a refund as a response to the ""delivered"" email notification, but the protocol between Temu and OnTrac (that Temu hides behind) gives their customers the run around. Mar 12, the notification of ""delivery"" was received by email, but no my items. I submitted a dispute for Temu charges using my cc company. It is in the works as I Type, and the money credited back to my account. Temu needs to be shut down for poor business ethics and fraudulent messages that they know are not true. DO NOT USE THEM. You have been warned by a Temu customer that has been duped. I wish I had read all of the many similar reviews on BBB, Google, etc. Today is Mar 16 - No package has ever been delivered. If so, they would/should take a pic of the delivered package for proof like other companies do. Mar 17 2024 Temu sends this automated response on Trustpilot that is copied and pasted below with no modifications. The link they send a customer asks your permission to record the conversation which gives Temu possible access to the customer's computer or phone. There have been complaints about Temu messing with people's phones. No thank you to that risk. In addition, the bot on the website chat likely sends you back to OnTrac to which OnTrac will tell the customer that their package has been delivered with no proof other than their word (no pic of delivery), then instruct the customer to contact the seller, Temu. No place to respond to Temu directly on here. Here's Temu's response on Mar 17, 2024 Reply from TemuAn hour agoHello Musika, thank you for reaching out to us.

I warned them that they are to use buzz code that directly to my cell and i can open building front door for delivery person to bring to my apt# ( part of my address).I did not receive the parcel nor management or onsite personal support worker see any parcel when TEMU said parcel delivered on March 12 at 7 pm.  So customer did not receive it but TEMU keeps on replying to my escalation that parcel was delivered to the address of the building so no reshipment nor refund.That is not caring for customers.The matter why the parcel was not received by customer is an internal matter with TEMU and the courier company that TEMU should deal with or perhaps chargeback. That should be not in the expense of the customer. customers since he delivery matterrcelHowever if u live in an apt building that if you did not receive the parcel even u gave TEMU your entry phone code to deliver to u, TEMU replied me that the parcel reached the shipment address ( it forgot that there is an apt in my address) and it refused to reship or refund.

"Disappointing platform, they know how to be nice until a problem arises, then as a customer you?€?ll discover that reliability is not an adequate criterion to them, as the customer start purchasing by reasonable  amount so that it is possible to checkout then from one purchase to another, the checkout amount starts to increase, for exactly the same category of products ,it?€?s  simply  it shows what they are dedicated to , much more respectable to demand shipping fees, than to use a transparent ploy, this despicable technique makes you feel disgustedTheir local delivery company sends messages, and does not meet the specified time (day ), this false technique repeats again and again ,the client's schedule is marginalized component for them ,not in their priority ,when I complained to Temu, they wrote apologies and other nice and ?€?sticky?€? words, at the same time they reminding me (by the way) that there is still time for the deadline, it is a cheap and vile response, because they turning the case so that it appears to be a customer problem , ""who is in a hurry and urgent to receive the products"", when it?€?s NOT the case, the problem is the false and misleading information provided by them, through the local delivery company , they know it is illegal act .This is a defective organizational culture, an indicator how they are tending to relate to complex issues with the customer.

I have purchased allsorts so far, and overall I am happy. Let's be honest, sometimes you just have to take a chance. Most of the items have been excellent (about 80% of orders - roughly 12 items). The remaining 20% - 1 item was rubbish and broke in 2 days, the other simply because you couldn't reduce the strap size. for me the biggest letdown/negative is the slow shipping times.

"Placed 2 separate orders with Temu that were to arrive in 4 packages. EVRI was their chosen courier! I received 1 of the packages. The others had the correct address but the delivery person did not deliver to me but somewhere else! I contacted Temu. Took a few hours to sort but I finally received a credit refunded for 2 of the packages but they refused to refund for the 3rd! I contacted my bank for a charge back! Barclays representative put a charge back on the wrong transaction! When I realised what happened I contacted the bank and cancelled it. However I had a credit in Temu and they have gone in and taken over ??120 out due to the chargeback error! NOTE if you have a credit on Temu and you do a charge back they take it from your credit!!!!I am now out of pocket for the 3 parcels not received and the charge back error made by Barclays. So Temu may offer some good deals and some items are decent quality BUT if you return an item always make sure the money goes back in your card do not accept the credit option! Currently attempting to sort it but unfortunately the call centre representatives do not seem to understand the issue. Though I can prove what I had and what was taken! Temu - thanks for replying I have reached out and as polite as the call center is - they cannot help! I?€?m waiting on a call back but if it?€?s anything like the email I received from you regards to my missing Packages which confirmed I received them and nothing more will be done, I don?€?t hold much hope!

EDIT:  ok even though I still find the games very annoying especially when that make you spin the wheel like 2 times or more I have gotten a few things on there that were pretty good I have also gotten some stuff that was pretty cheap and with the prices I kinda expect that however the shipping seems to be faster then it use to be they may break you shipment up if you have a lot of stuff. Also I have received one or two items that were either defective or broken and  I requested a refund/credit  and Temu gave me the credit right then without having to send anything back I did provide picture proof but I don?€?t know if it necessary I just did it so I was pleased with that aspect I?€?m not sure how getting a refund goes if you have to go through the trouble of sending it back overseas because that would really be pain but for credit it was very easy and painless if I ever have to ask for a refund I will be sure to let everyone know how that goes so all and all I still use Temu sometimes I like buying craft supplies from them but I still stand by my initial review  because I could definitely do with out all the In your face pop up adds and stuff Seriously Temu stop with the annoying pop up game crap i don?€?t want to spin a wheel and  have to play all this crap  just to look at your app quick  to see if I?€?m interested in what I saw on Google. not only that but I?€?m forced to pay like 3 games! It is more then annoying it actually prevents me from shopping on your site because I have to keep going through these discount games that are only good if you spend over 100$ I am an adult I do t want to play games every single time I get on your site if other ppl feel like I do you are probably losing customers over this I know I do t shop on your site some times just because I do t want to sit there and be forced to spin a wheel 2 or even 3 times !! Bad business model in my opinion get rid of the games or at least don?€?t force ppl to play them especially multiple times !,4,14/07/2023

"TEMU is now my go to for online shopping. I avoid the clothes as have bad experiences with the likes of Shein, so I buy mostly housewares, and I can?€?t say I?€?ve been disappointed in anything I?€?ve bought because 1. I realise I?€?m paying cents to the Euro for a similar product on the shelf, therefore I don?€?t have really high expectations of the quality. 2. Have been pleasantly surprised at just how good the quality of some of the items actually are!! I?€?ll not apologise to the Negative Nancy's for not aligning with your hate for this company because my experiences have been all good!!",5,15/07/2023

"So frustrating, it?€?s the games and deals that upset me. Just as you get close to meeting their amount, they change up what each invite is worth.

"I bought 5 times from Temu and I have no issues with their customer service. Things that is not up to standard, they will just refund the money. I will either throw away the items or donate it to the charity as suggested by Temu. Eventhough sometimes their promotion is not really a promotion, but there will be price adjustment and Temu will refund the difference. Very fair. I can say that I m satisfied with 95% of the items I have purchased so far; functional household items, beautiful skirts, clogs, sandals and etc. love it. No charge for refund, immediately you get back the money. Fair. So far I received my parcel within 7 to 10 days after I placed the orders. An post postman in my area is very good and responsible. He will always ring my door bell and ensure I receive the parcel. I m very pleased and satisfied with everything. Thank you Temu.",5,15/07/2023
"Have been ordering for a while, seemed okay. Had an issue a few months ago that they didn't deal with but I couldn't be bothered to dispute. Now I've had missing items (not costly but needed) and I've addressed them with customer services. They say the warehouse sent items therefore they cannot send them out or refund me. It's absolutely disgusting! They had me on chat for 2.5hours! I was so frustrated I actually burst into tears. Today I have come back on to speak to a manager, no agent is putting me through or opening a ticket! Again I feel like crying! It's not a lot of money but the principle is very wrong! How dare they treat customers like criminals! They implied that I was lying. I don't think anyone in their right mind would lie about a ??3 item and a ??2 item! Reply to temu: You have asked me to get in touch but I have done this 3 times and asked to speak to a manager or for a ticket to be opened and the agents have refused point blank! I asked for the complaints procedure but they have refused to give me that too. I have no way of contacting anyone relevant at temu who can help me. It's a very bad system! Disgusting customer service! Do not care about their customers at all!!!",1,15/07/2023
"I?€?ve ordered clothing for a second time & I must congratulate them on their customer service. I ordered 4 items, however 1 was too small.

"I ordered a few small items to check quality service etc. The products are basically like the ""Wish"" site. What completely shocked me was their sales approach. Here's an example: 12 Oz. Stainless steel coffee mug with lid. They list it at $ 106.22. Then they discount it 86% to $17.49. Do they really expect anyone with half a brain to believe a 12oz. Coffee mug is $106.22? How about simple Cargo shorts for  $125.00 reduced to $24.99. They do this with EVERYTHING!!! This is most deceptive business practice lve ever seen and lm retired from sales and Marketing. Know your getting products that at best are sold at their discounted price but you won't be getting quality that reflects those ridiculous S.R.P. Buyer beware!!! UPDATE: l recieved a variety of products l ordered to evaluate the companies policy's and quality of products. What l recieved was quite disappointing considering they grossly overvalued these products and then claim your getting huge percentage discounts on the item. The fact is this is the biggest case of perceived value lve ever seen. The end price they charge is the actually the retail price. If that, in fact l call most of their products as Dollarstore quality. The cargo shorts l ordered which they said were worth $106.00 and reduced some 85% to arrive at the end cost of approx. $25. This is the price you would pay in every case at any other outlet. I am a level 9 Master reviewer for Google and have over 40 years in sales and marketing experience. I have no ax to grind and only want people to be honesty informed when l see deceptive sales practices. I have canceled the account and blocked them on my phone. End of story",2,15/07/2023

Temu's experience on delivery is the worst. Why do they let customers pay such an absurd amount of customs and take ages to clear them for delivery.Their support email does not exist apparently and have been waiting for my order for more than a week yet it was mentioned it has landed in SA and should pay.I am hoping that I will get my order because some reviews are scary as I go through them. My order has not moved or any updates after paying. Order things from the at your own risk or use Shein it is more reliable because after paying customs your order is released for delivery.,1,15/07/2023
Most of the products I purchased failed within months. The product quality isn't there so even the discounted prices ended up expensive. Not to mention their   pesky ads appear on every website you ever visit after . It's stalking on another level.,1,15/07/2023
"I try not to be negative but ....The WORST thing by far, are the non stop emails/notifications, reminding you to complete your purchase or tell you the item will run out etc.  Then you get constant notifications offering coupons and discounts if you complete the purchase.  I did make one purchase, against all my instincts!   Items recently arrived. Out of 7 items, one is decent and fair price.  One has still to be tested.  One had to be taken outside immediately! Because the smell was VILE.  It was a cat straw sort of basket. If was discoloured and totally out of shape, the smell was lingering in the house long after it was put in the outside bin! A laundry basket was cardboard type of material, that smelled as well but nothing as bad as that basket.Othee items gone in the Charity bag, didn't even them pen properly, So one item good and great value, one to be tested.  One in bin, rest in charity bag.So disgusted with the items and fed up with multiple contacrs, that I  have deleted the app and blocked Temu on email.I don't want any money back. I want nothing to do with them, their marketing is so so pushy. One good thing, delivery was verygood.",1,16/07/2023

Most items were damaged or low quality, return was requested.  Contacted Temu after going round and round over an hour with chat bot by this point crying and frustrated. Got information from someone how to get an real chat agent (tricky) only to get an agent that didn't read the concerns and kept sending generic policy script back. Issues were unable to repackage items in original packaging needed new packaging and tape or sealable. Needed items to be picked up due to not being able to get to UPS store to send.

Indeed, some of the products are not 1st class quality, but look at the price too.You can afford ANC headphones at 20 EUR, so, you don't mind too much the quality...When I had issues with the transport, their Support Desk was there, polite and offering information and coupons. There is also post-sale support, and you can easily return the products that came damaged or you just don't like. Sometimes, you are reimbursed and can keep the item, which is also great. Indeed, I did not use Alibaba or Shein before so I don't have a comparison tool, but all in all, I do like Temu very much.",5,16/07/2023

The people at the warehouse lied to me when they stated that two failed attemp deliveries, one at 11:33 p.m  and another one at 1:22 a.m, these time was close to midnight. This is an outright lie. Do you believe Temu deliver items at midnigh? ! I tried to contact with customer service and was told to contact with the warehouse. I contacted the warehouse 4 times to request the delivery. They insisted that I come to pickup or the package to be sent back to Temu.I will not order anything from Temu. The customer service is just bouncing around your  request.

"This has been the worst experience I've had with a company. Not only did they fail to deliver the product I ordered, but they also held onto my cash without providing any explanation or issuing a refund. The most frustrating part is their support system; it's practically impossible to get in touch with anyone for assistance. I've tried multiple times to reach out, but to no avail. It's utterly disappointing and unacceptable. I would strongly advise anyone considering doing business with this company to think twice and look elsewhere for reliable service.",1,17/07/2023
I ordered some art spares from Temu.  I've never ordered before but I was really pleased.  Everything I ordered would have been much more expensive if I had purchased here. I was kept updated on my package and its travel all the way to delivery.  It all arrived safely. The tissue paper was a little wrinkled (due to its travels) but I just hot ironed it back into shape and it was perfect and ready to use.

"I have purchased quite a few things from Temu in the last year. In my personal experience, I have have had no problems with service or delivery, they have done all they promised and communicate well, I've gotten $5 credits for late delivery, and have received easy to get refunds as promised (1 per order, keep your orders small). Late orders are almost always the carriers fault. My brief summary is: Really read the listing, some can be very misleading. Ignore all ---coupons, popups, limited time offers, almost out of stock,  19 cent items,. 97% off etc. ----- and only buy what you REALLY need and can use. Their whole game here is to encourage impulse or fear buying, and if something gets sold out there's almost always an alternative. I usually put a bunch of stuff in my cart, and then heavily edit when ready to order. Keep your expectations in check.  Some stuff was pure junk, many were  worth the price, some have been exceptional deals. The reviews are often pretty useless. Keep in mind Temu does not make these items, they are are a just a distributor. Note - I have found some of the same items on Amazon for the same price or less.  Don't assume temu to have the best deal, at least on items over $10 or so.",5,17/07/2023
"MASSIVE FIVE STARS all the way. My ONLY gripe is their 'chat' I don't find that helpful or competent at all, but then I don't with other companies either.I can't put a 'date of experience' in, because I've been shopping with them since middle of last year. I wish I'd found them earlier, I wouldn't have spent so much at Amazon and eBay then..who are sadly lacking very much behind TEMU imho.I've spent lots on TEMU. I love most of their stuff. I've ordered allsorts.My latest order included bedding and I've taken it with me (pillowcases) to places to show people. A lot of them have decided to shop with TEMU as a result of what they've seen. One set cost ??70 in Amazon & AliExpress, but my set from TEMU it was ??20.64. the colour is amazing and it's good quality too. I've never had a problem with getting refunded if an item was missing, or if I had to cancel before shipping (usually from double ordering or size mistakes) unfortunately that's where I HAVE had a 'belly-full' of their customer service..(sorry) ONE THING I wish they would do, is somehow let someone know when they already ordered a particular item on a previous order.. that might sound outrageous, but I've ordered a LOT and am totally addicted to doing so. I've even got an order going through now that has doubled items on it. But I'll use them so it'll be fine. I particularly like...no, I'm not gonna say because if I do, there won't be any left for me when I go back for more ???????????? you think I'm joking... NO I ain't!!EDIT:- I'm unsure where the answerer got that I wasn't happy with them. Like I mentioned, my only gripe was the nightmare 'chat-bot' but facing facts, ALL or MOST 'chat' things are exactly the same. I came in today, to jot down my last order in my book, and was shocked to see they only had average of 3*.. On reading some of the lower star rating reviews, I'm glad someone from the company is answering. I wish we were allowed too.If you hate the 'chat-bot' as much as I do, I've since found out that you can 'request a call' and that is so very much easier than trying to explain issues on the bot.. I've NEVER had issues with return/refund problems, and it clearly states your options for refunds going to your balance or your bank, so accusing them of greed is unfair, as you must've made that decision yourself! (In my case, the only time I get a minimum spend is when I've been given coupons for money off, that is, imho, perfectly understandable)In most retail outlets you are on a time LIMIT for returns, again, waiting 31days is unacceptable, you wouldn't get away with it in a shop..in the UK anyway!!I still love shopping with TEMU and will continue so please don't blaspheme them if you've shopped and then a mistake happens. They do, in life, often.. just ""count-to-ten-and-start-again!"" That works with most things in life..",5,17/07/2023
Because of price this can only be 5 stars. No postal fees wich is increadible for does prices. Usually sites like aliexpress lure you into cheap prices with heavy fees for delivery. I will be using Temu in the future if their prices keep being this low.,5,18/07/2023
"I?€?ve recently ordered some tee shirts from Temu, I will admit I was a little sceptical, but have to say for the price they are actually very ok ???? and fitted well, looking forward to wearing them in the coming summer months, just hoping they wash ok, I?€?ll probably hand wash.Delivery was very quick as well ???? will definitely use again.",5,18/07/2023

"Quite alarming experience. I ordered a ladder extension for roofing work. The product was rubbish, could hardly assemble it do to poor manufacturer , sent picture and video, showing how crap it was, never heard anything back. BUT EVEN MORE SCARY. I have used the same bank account for 40 years never had any fraud or issues. Days after my order with Temu I get 5 fraudulent charges for a total of ??350 on my account. Lucky I have a private banking account with my bank and they quickly spotted and blocked before further damage could be done and paid me back within an hour , good job Bank Of Scotland. I checked through all my transactions for the previous 4 months the only purchased I made which was not to a regular known party was the Temu purchase. My bank also tells me in the days before these charges there was 2 other attempts were made to charge my card. Co-incidence ? I don't think so. I would urge you to seriously consider your security if purchasing from Temu. I can only concluded there is either a dishonest employee accessing customers details or the security of customer data is so poor it gets hacked both worrying. I will never use this company again.UPDATE 11 March 2024Temu asked for an update. So I have added my order number to Temu message requesting additional info today. I will not be entering additional personal information until I get some confirmation that you are to be trusted. Additionally I received an email from Temu on 17th February shortly before the bank fraud. I found it  suspicious at the time and never responded to the email. The email requested me the reset my Temu password after my request. I never made such a request. If Temu are serious about security then prove it by doing some proper investigation.",1,18/07/2023
Usually temu has giving me outstanding results and I have had no problems. Untill a week ago my package arrived with many items missing I flided a complaint and it was denied.

"I have ordered an item from Temu with free shipping and received a pro forma invoice from Buffalo. There is no description of what the invoice is for. After I posted this review, I received an email from Temu indicating that this is NOT for VAT or Duties. This undefined amount is 40% of the value of the item.  It appears to be their hidden change for ""free shipping"". In addition, the pro forma invoice is not tax compliant as it does not show their VAT number or the VAT amount. No import documents were provided either. ALL THE E-MAILS TO BUFFALO AND TEMU SO FAR HAVE BOUNCED.  This is really poor service. So they will then just have to send the stuff back and refund us.

"I?€?ve only used the site once, but it?€?s been a great experience. I was a little annoyed by the 25$ minimum to make a purchase at first, but in using the site more, that?€?s small potatoes. Everything I ordered came in one package, a day before the delivery window, I believe; Not like some similar retailers that ship everything separately. All the items were great, and I got more than I expected (from not reading titles properly). The only thing I would change is that when saving or favouriting items, there are no categories or any way to organize things, so to use your wish list is still days of sorting through your own chaos to find the things you want for this order.",4,18/07/2023

I ordered for my granddaughters Birthday. Should have arrived in Tennessee around the 3-4th. But instead I received them today in my mail. Granddaughter was very upset that my presents didn?€?t make her party . I?€?m so fed up with all the issues that I?€?ve dealt with like this . Then I can?€?t get into my orders because every time I search for my orders it keeps taking me to different order sites. I?€?m going to quit ordering from them because they don?€?t want to talk to you if you have a complaint. I?€?ve spent a lot of money on  Temu ????especially when I have to keep re shipping them . I end up paying 2-3 times more.,1,18/07/2023
"Was very hesitant to use this website, as they had such good deals, and the price seemed too good to be true, but the only way I?€?m going to know if the products are good or not, is to try them. I bought a selection of items ranging from freezer labels to fridge storage boxes. I was expecting a very long delivery, but it was only about 7-10 days, also I wasn?€?t expecting great quality either, but I?€?m impressed that some of the items are very well made and feel sturdy. It?€?s a website in that you will buy a huge amount of items because the prices are so low, but you can find weird and wonderful things as well. I think I will be using Temu again.",4,18/07/2023

"Overall very satisfied by Temu's concept, despite all the various negative opinions that surface. I have purchased numerous small items (no clothes), little gadgets, cheap stuff. Prices are great, shipping is quite fast, and email updates are spot on during the purchase. Items are as expected... Rarely items don't look as great as in the photos, but considering the prices, that can be overlooked. Finally, I've never had any issues with personal data or credit card mishaps.",5,19/07/2023

Be careful of empty promises. I used my husband details for the order, PO- 184-21344879299192071.I already contacted live chats they are of no use, they could not assist, the only thing that was said is they are sorry for the inconvenience and for my bad experience.

"Temu is basically amazon with lower prices because they don't charge vendors 30% of the sale forcing vendors to markup but way more than they need to to mae a profit.. Temu doesn't share these isses because they are profit by quantity similar to the old Japanese parts per million. Product quality is on par or better than amazon however Temu doesn't have many if any brand name products but the low cost and for the most part Ive been very pleasantly surprised with the items I've ordered aside from a couple complete flops, Temu has been my goto for things I don't mind waiting 2-3 weeks for which is actually much faster than a lot of items on amazon coming from China. Return policy usually is painless and with instant  Temu credit and no return needed in most cases is great.Temu does moderate stars part of their reviews and won't allow anything under 4 stars but your review can be honest. Stick with items with as close to 5 stars as you can get and then read some review to see if there are and negative reviews and se what complaints there are if any. Biggest ssue I've had with temu is size. Whatever you are going to order, just make sure you look at all pics for sizes and quantities, they have been know to use tricky wording.  Check your cart to make sure you are ordering what you think you are ordering. Dip your toes slowly with a couple cheap items your first time.",4,19/07/2023

"First time TEMU shopping. Go to checkout. Punch in my bank card details. Temu asks if I wish to store my card details on line?.  I punch in. NO.  A message comes up saying TEMU has successfully stored my card information for next purchase!.  I cancel items. Re buy. Go through checkout. Again. Again TEMU asks if I want to store my card?. Again I say NO.  Again TEMU says my bank details are recorded on TEMU, for my next purchase/s!.  NOTE:- If you try to cancel and delete TEMU, you fill out all the appropriate forms.  No button! to execute/send request off! and getting rid of Temu!.  So I've blocked and spammed Temu, from my email address.   Totally unprofessional.  Totally unacceptable, when dealing with highly sensitive people's $$$ and highly people's PERSONAL sensitive banking details.REPLY TO TEMU COMMENTS: your reply addresses discrepancies with my bank.  You reply to convince your customer's that your TEMU buying online is safe.  You HAVE NOT ANSWERED the problems I had when buying on YOUR TEMU online shopping.  To answer and reply to me on other issues not relating to my experience just proves how you cannot answer and explain the fact that you keep people's banking details when a customer refuses to keep them on your TEMU online shop.   Plus you have NOT mentioned or addressed the fact that you cannot delete a TEMU online account.   I don't need to read information about banks and their online structures.  This review is about you. TEMU.  Your reply to my review complaint, just proves my point entirely that TEMU is not an online shopping venue, that has people's best banking security, at it's  heart. It just does what it wants regardless.",1,19/07/2023

I ordered about 8 items from Temu and it appeared each item was available and estimated shipping/delivery dates appeared reasonable.  However after placing the order it was revealed the shipping was from outside the US and so the tracking number was worthless and the expected delivery dates were longer than expected.

Than in my account I clicked on the get credit and free gifts was I selected the option to choose 5 gifts, I did, they added a 6th gift as Bonus, sundenly the free gifts have a orice and I had to invite people to cut the price. Ok I started inviting people to cut gifts price, when I reached the last gift, I invited a lot of people but price cuting was still not complete. I continue to invite people, at the end I realized that I was losing my time and they convert me into a spammer, I was spaming my friends and other professional contact I have... And the worse I was stuck on the last give which means I will get no gift... They are great manipulators with no ethic...

I keep getting told that I will only receive a refund if all items are returned back to the Temu warehouse. How is this even possible when UPS could not locate the package and therefore paid out a claim to Temu? The whole point of the claim is because the package is missing. How am I suppose to have something returned that cannot be found?I dont get it. Hammy also keeps repeating back the exact same messages, and is unable to read or provide adequate support.

Temu refused to believe this was true as their warehouse confirmed they had sent everything.  However the reality is that someone made a mistake and one item was missing.Temu has no effective customer service and all they keep saying is they can do nothing. Their operators on live chat just go round in circles apologising and ignoring the fact that I have not received the item I paid for.  No solution has been offered so it?€?s basically money down the drain.  Temu might be cheap but paying for goods that never arrive with no way of either getting them resent or a refund is incredibly expensive.Follow up:After Temu?€?s reply below I asked again regarding the missing item and quoted the offer below to give Temu a second chance.

Totally shocking Everi sent a message saying my parcel would be delivered between 1700hrs and 1830hrs I contacted them advising that I am out at work Fri. 1130am until around midnight they still tried to deliver in the evening then said it was delivered I checked when I got home nothing on the door step nothing behind my door my second order they sent a picture of a bag hanging from a letter box on the outside claiming it was my door and this was my proof of delivery I don't know if the courier was at it or if they did leave the package and it was stolen twice in 1 week anyone with any common sense wouldn't leave a parcel outside in this area it is bad for drug abuse and has a high crime rate since they started moving financial migrants into the area it has gone rapidly down hill I just can't believe anyone could be so stupid as to leave a parcel hanging out of a letter box for security there is a flap behind the inside of my letter box so it would be impossible to post anything other than a letter that would bend I have no word's for the level of stupidity I had to give 1 star maybe one day again I did get a delivery the first time I ordered a few month's back when I wad on night shif a breathalyser and a watch and both we're great for the money but if they are going to use one of the worst courier services in the UK the old Hermese now trading as Everi what do they expect they changed there trading name to Everi but nothing else changed the same rubbish service how they can still operate I do not know 1 out of 3 parcels arrived safely that's poor by anyone's standards and then Temu the answer they have to the problem is send you a message we have made a mistake purchase more product's from us and you can purchase them at the so called discounted price firstly why not sell the item at the best possible price to start with secondly why would I purchase more item's from a company that couldn't get the item's I looked at and decided I really needed and wanted they have asked me for information supplied IE hope that I wouldn't respond so this review could be taken down well sorry Temu not acceptable you are using a substandard courier companies who are that bad changed there trading name but that's all that has changed not the customer experience I was going to say you get what you pay for but you simply don't I did get a message confirming my refund would be sent to my card but that doesn't resolve my problem I will get my money back in around 2 week's Temu you have already had my money for several weeks and I have noting but a soar head bit that's all a soar head are you going to send me some aspirin for my soar head,1,22/07/2023

"As a loyal customer of Temu, I've always appreciated their products and service. However, my recent experience has left me deeply disappointed and questioning their integrity.Upon receiving a promotion promising a ??120 coupon with the purchase of two items, I eagerly proceeded to make my purchase, excited about the potential savings. However, to my dismay, as soon as I completed my transaction, the coupon option mysteriously disappeared.This sudden disappearance of the promised coupon feels nothing short of a scam. It's disheartening to see a company I once trusted resort to such deceptive tactics. As a result of this experience, I have lost faith in Temu and will no longer be shopping with them.Furthermore, I feel compelled to warn my friends and family about this deceptive practice, urging them to reconsider any future purchases from Temu. It's crucial for consumers to be aware of such misleading promotions and to hold companies accountable for their actions.In conclusion, my once-positive opinion of Temu has been tarnished by this deceitful incident. It's truly disappointing to see a company prioritize short-term gains over the trust and loyalty of its customers.",1,22/07/2023
"I am not sure how this is legalAll of their promotions and buyer protections are misleading. I needed to request a refund and they've just outright said no. No buyer protection at all and now will need to go via my Bank. Usually you will speak to a bot and no customer representatives know what they're talking about, they tend to copy and paste the same lines ! I have tried to contact your customer service on 5 different occasions, with each rep being unhelpful.Edit: Temu reported my review however trust pilot has deemed it acceptable. I have given you one more chance, contacted your customer service. Again they are copying and pasting the same lines and not acknowledging what I am saying.",1,22/07/2023

"I received notification that my Temu order was delivered.   I checked my large secured letterbox, nothing.  I checked with my neighbour, nothing, but they did see a delivery guy.  I check the photo on Temu, yes it was my front door.  It was open, so I was home at the time of delivery but no one knocked.  I checked my security camera.  No one came onto the premises expect the delivery guy. We have a tall garden around the front of the house.  To take the parcel, they would have had to come onto the property and in view of the camera. We can't see if the parcel was left or where it was left after the photo was taken.  My concerns are, why wasn't it left in a secured letterbox or an attempt to knock to hand it personally to me.",1,22/07/2023

Don?€?t get attracted by the offers they give you. If you hate picking up packages from service point and if there is a issue then there is no where to reach out too as their customer service is an AI system which can just answer prepopullared question, no contact numbers.

I would advise that you contact the shipper as they will be able to discuss a potential replacement or refund with you directly. I will inform the courier's manager of this outcome.I'm sorry for the inconvenience regarding your parcel delivery.Kind regards,Evri Customer Services?€??€??€??€?-I must express my utter disappointment with Temu?€?s customer service, which has proven to be nothing short of a nightmare. Despite escalating my case to the courier manager, there has been a shocking lack of action, leaving me without a refund or a replacement for my order.It is abundantly clear that Temu is more interested in robbing customers than providing a satisfactory service. Every attempt to resolve the issue has fallen on deaf ears, with no willingness to acknowledge their mistakes or rectify the situation.This experience has not only soured my opinion of Temu but also serves as a warning to others considering their services. The blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and the refusal to address valid concerns demonstrate a company that prioritizes profit over its customers.Save yourself the frustration and potential loss ?€? steer clear of Temu and their appalling customer service. Your hard-earned money deserves better treatment than what this company is willing to offer.Consider this a cautionary tale for anyone contemplating doing business with Temu.",1,23/07/2023

I received notfication package had arrived but was frustrated at this point because the courier did not leave a card to let me know that my package was delivered to my neighbour.

Why do they say free delivery and then I get a robot call from Buffalo couriers that my package has arrived and I need to pay R387.60 SA rands before 48 hours or the package will be sent back?

"Temu is Ok you get what you pay for .....compare it to Poundland etc It is better than Ali Express and other Chinese stores   BUT  i never order above the minimum ??15 BECAUSE .....the final stage of the process involves Evri who are the worst delivery company in the world ....... they just dump stuff on the doorstep where it often gets stolen. Royal Mail do not do that.  (TEMU that works in China I have seen it on my many visits)  but not in the UK...but I am sure that customers would pay a little more  for knowing that their goods were safe.  I advise anyone not to spend big money because their ""cheapest"" delivery partner is terrible   I lost 3 packets from China  delivered by Hermes/Evri so far I have not had this problem with Temu.  Your logistics are brilliant but Evri are SLOW and UNRELIABLE   so I never never spend over the minimum",4,25/07/2023

I purchased many items at Temu amd overall im very satisfied. Some things look better at the site then in reality but you can return it without any problems. The only thing i dont like is that game Farmland. That game is really a scam. Ive got so many points because i bought a lot of products and still i did not reach the 100 procent.

"After shopping with them for a while and placing around 50 orders, I started encountering problems that get worse and have me trying to close the account... apparently something else u can't do. Temu are changing their 'policies'. To the person who started on about how she got the price cap removed on her 1 and only order... well done. According to Temu the amount of the customer spend is directly linked to sustainability... it isn't, it only means the customer has to spend more... but since when has the truth been a factor in the policies of Temu? I can't get a refund from my account to my bank as this isn't policy either. I have to spend my money with them or lose it. Oh what shall I do with my hard earned money?!? Can't seem to close my account either.????not happy and will find a way to end all dealings with this company.",1,25/07/2023

This refund process is dodgy. The order was constantly delayed and quality was basic. Now I find it's impossible to contact Temu for a refund.

"Bought a pair of MX gloves from Temu in adult Large. They looked like the Brisker 100% range but Temu don?€?t tell you which model they are at point of sale. I have an old pair of the Brisker and what was delivered looked identical to my Brisker glove apart from the material weight and size, the Temu L is smaller and lighter. The glove model is stated as iTrack but the glove design does not match the iTrack model. I think these are likely to be fake, lesson learned, as if I needed to learn it again, Temu is in the junk folder",1,26/07/2023

I like their non clothing products. They are exactly how described The clothing items are a disappointment sizing is totally wrong and quality very poor.,3,26/07/2023
I just love this website. Prices are so affordable and such a great selection. Items have always arrived within a week. I look forward to opening my package when it arrives.,5,26/07/2023
I recieved my first order & happy as. Colour photos vs reality is less vibrant & sizing is comfy. Good site for fast seasonal clothing. Ty temu,4,26/07/2023
"I was skeptical but I decided to try shopping on Temu. I am glad I did. Prices very reasonable, their communication is very good in keeping you posted. My order arrived on time, if it hadn't I wdve received a $5.00 credit. My items were very nicely made, better quality than some items I have purchased from Amazon actually. I kept everything and I feel I got a got deal. There were no problems with my credit card. I am pleased...I am saving a lot of money shopping with Temu and I have just placed mu 2nd order. Am looking forward to its arrival. My 1st order arrived in about 7-8 days. My 2nd one arrives in about the same.",5,26/07/2023
"My experience with this company has been great. You must have time to browse through their endless items and you will be  shocked by the low prices. One and only catch, it takes roughly 2 weeks to get your order and if by chance you get an item you are not happy with than contact their very helpful customer service and they will do all they can to make it better. This company sells low cost items yet they treat every person/every order as they matter every time.I can't say I deal with ANY other company these days that customer service actually helps or cares. Temu does.",5,26/07/2023
"Cannot claim for lost items and damaged package that delivered, horrible customer services can?€?t find any solution, spam all same messages. I pay for nothing!!I did try every way that they suggest, cs team said that they already cooperated with supervisors but still got denied for refund.",1,26/07/2023
I have been using Temu for over 8 months . No complaints great prices great service. No problem with anything I have ordered Unique and no one can beat there products,5,26/07/2023
"I've only recently started using this and have placed a few orders and have no complaints, everything I have received have been of good quality and the prices are unbelievable cheap.",5,26/07/2023
So far bought two orders around 30 pounds from Temu. Happy with the purchases. There was one defective item and Temu refunded me right away.,4,26/07/2023
"This company is going worse and worse. Used to offer a ??5 credit if package was late now it?€?s ??4. Taking longer and longer to dispatch orders. Customer service has to be one of the worst around. Really frustrating these days and will stop using the company.Edit: received a faulty item, some cream that had opened and gone all over my package customer service as usual are useless and want me to send an empty bottle back for a refund. It?€?s ??3. I?€?ve sent photo proof of the product leaked and they?€?re still expecting me to go through the hassle of returning an empty bottle for ??3. Disgusting customer service. Will not use them ever again.",1,26/07/2023
"I have liked the stuff that I have gotten off Temu. The stuff is well priced which is hard to find these days! Their customer service has also been great when I wanted to return an item. So why only 3 stars? I have wasted a lot of my time and they are very deceptive with their ?€?coupons?€? and ?€?deals.?€? For example, I have all these pop up?€?s that make it seem like you are the one lucky winner of a prize, then they double it. The prize ends up being not 45 but 90 percent of one item. You have to use it on a certain page. Once you pick your item, in order to get that item off 90 %, you have to buy 4 more items. This was never mentioned before. They also have ?€?deals?€? where if you buy a certain amount, you ?€?get 300 dollars back in coupons!?€? What you actually get are a couple of coupons with different percentages off that you have to use in successive orders and all within a narrow time frame. I think it may have even been 24 hours. It is not easy to ex out of getting all these ?€?gifts?€? and wastes a lot of time when I pick out all this stuff only to realize it?€?s not worth the ?€?deal.?€? I wouldn?€?t mind it so much either if it weren?€?t so deceptive. Please just be honest about what you are offering. Instead of having me spin the wheel twice and to get something 90 percent off, and then ?€? multiply the reward?€? by making me pick 4 more things ?€?at 50 % off?€? in order to get the prize, just say if you buy 5 things off this page, you can get one item at 90 percent off. And specify what the ?€?$$ in coupons?€? actually entails. It?€?s even worse if they are trying to have you refer friends for gifts.Having said that, I do appreciate the app and will be buying more off of it, but I have learned to not waste my time on most of the deals, they are too good to be true and always have a catch.",3,26/07/2023
"I've been a customer of Temu since 2022. Many purchases made. Some items, I returned but kept more than returned. They are quick to refund and no hassle to return. No problem with stolen info. I'd recommend and I have to many with my experience",5,26/07/2023
Recently started shopping at Temu UK and I am very impressed with the service and quality of the items purchased.,5,26/07/2023
Firstly to the person who knocked a star of because min order went up you can talk to bot and get minimum order price took away completely! I've used temu long time now and really have little to no complaints BUT I now see if order delayed/ late you only get ??4 instead of ??5. I've also knocked a star of as previously if something was of bad quality or not like description then you got the price back rather than go through the hassle of trying to get items back to china. I must say I do like the price adjustments this has meant Ive had free orders,4,26/07/2023
"Unfortunately I have to leave 1 star to post a review.Most important is watch your finances TEMU FORCES reoccurring payments!!! Keep an eye on that! Secondly let?€?s face it, it?€?s all crap made in China so pretty much everything is sub par!I can?€?t say it enough! Watch for those automatic reoccurring payments!I have been asked to provide order numbers or my review will be taken down! I was only able to submit 1 of the 4 orders that were on reoccurring payments!",1,27/07/2023
Disappointed as I am waiting for refund after one week.,2,27/07/2023
I love shopping online at Temu the prices are brilliant and I always get my orders on time. They have so much to choose from too.,5,27/07/2023
"My review is not about the quality of goods like many reviews (in the end, you get what you pay for), but about that, as soon as the company sends your order, they no longer worry about the status of the order and delivery. To insure themselves, they immediately warn you that delivery takes 5-12 business days. Okay. Problems begin when after the said waiting period you have to go to their site and find out that your package is already in the post office, and waits for you to be picked up!? Why is it not delivered to your house?? Because you were either not home, or your phone did not work/was indicated incorrectly, or the address is not specified correctly. And what is amazing that all other sites (including even Aliexpres), where I usually also make orders, have no problems to call me, or find my house, or just send me email with information about upcoming delivery days. So enough is enough. I decided that this would be the last time I use Temu. I will spam this site.",1,27/07/2023
Absolute junkEverything I ordered was either of a very poor quality or virtually useless. Micro fibre towelsThinner than a paper bag. Cosmetic bags terribly constructed. Whilst delivery from China was more than a week I wouldn?€?t be tempted with these prices.,1,27/07/2023
Be careful!It is hot and miss if orders are received and when they are they are damaged and missing items due to poor packaging.My last order was missing 2 items and split open on delivery.Temu refuse to resend or refund as ?€?the warehouse confirms the order was shipped and not damaged?€?How the hell does the warehouse know how it was delivered when I have submitted photos they just get cancelled and the warehouse over rules!!Absolutely shocking customer service!!,1,27/07/2023
"Scammers, 2 items were missing from my order worth over ??10, the packing was ripped and courier put all contents and original packing in a grey bag and added a new label which clearly showed something happened during transit but they refused refund so I had to go through section 75.",1,27/07/2023
"Three times in a row sent big packages with a mail service that delivers in the mailbox, and if they do not fit in the mailbox, they left the packages outside the mailbox in a public place. I talked with them twice to using another mail service but they did not even read the messages, just copied pasted answers",1,27/07/2023
"No complaints after placing 6 orders over the past year. You can't beat their prices, free shipping and no hassle returns.  Only one item arrived with damage which was caused by the shipper.  Temu issued an immediate refund for the total cost of the item.   You need to be reasonable and manage your expectations in relation to the cost of each item.   I have not been disappointed in any of the multiple items that I have received.  I will continue to order through my Paypal account!",5,27/07/2023
"So many are afraid to buy from Temu BUT they are missing out on many fantastic deals and items. I have been a happy Customer for many months nown buying clothes, shoes, building wood toys, wood puzzles, kitchen items, eye glasses, they are incredible. IF you have an item arrive broken, take a photo and send it along with the return item on your order, TEMU refunds you instantly, NO problems.Amazon don't even do that for you. I use PayPal when ordering so its easy check out and refunds go directly back to Paypal. Temu is a great company and there not scammers like some people think they are. I give them 5 stars on quality, customer service, and even hassle free returns.",5,27/07/2023
"I have made several purchases from Temu and I am extremely happy with them. Purchases include Trainers, Socks, Boxer swimwear and a couple of Sweaters. The trainers are very comfortable and good quality. I wear them everyday and no wear or tare. I have seen one pair of Trainers on another Web site at double the price.I will certainly make other purchases.",5,27/07/2023
"This review will probably be deleted as most of my honest reviews are. Just being truthful about my dealings with Temu.Numerous orders have been either damaged or missing items and or broken.I have contacted customer service and they alway refer me to the item that was broken or damage or missing, I go there, and nothing seems to be done.Be CAREFULL when ordering. Read descriptions carefully, do not depend on reviews others have made, make your own decisions. As far as me I think I am no longer a customer of Temu. Going back to Amazon.",1,27/07/2023

"Absolutely terrible customer serviceMy account was tampered with and a phone number was registered to the account that doesnt belong to me. I have tried to get in contact with customer service for 5 days with no luck. I have tried writing to them on Facebook, which was even worse. No help with the issue, vouldnt get the some worker or bot to get me an email address tl contact temu customer service and they kept asking for an order number for some reason. I did not purchase anything i merely wanted to get the phone number that clearly isnt mine deleted from my account and since i cannot login to temu due to the wrong numbered.being registered to the account. I cannot do this myself No help and have an account that been hacked or tampered with. Just absolutely horrendous service",1,27/07/2023
Overpriced Tat. Constantly hounded with adverts for Temu. On every online app I can block certain company adverts if I'm not interested in them. Not Temu. Gets rammed down my throat everywhere which has put me off ever using them further.Edited - since posting this review I am now being asked to provide my email address and telephone number to Temu or my review maybe taken down . LOOK AT ALL THE 1 STAR REVIEWS . WEIRD BUSINESS PRACTICES FROM TEMU. THIS REVIEW WILL LIKLEY GET DELETED.,1,27/07/2023
"Temu is getting puffed up and doing the dumbest business practices. They just implemented a verification rule whereby for all orders even if it's reorders you have to take a picture of credit card, numbers be hidden halfway yes halfway while the last 4 must not be hidden. You have to also attach a bank statement  yes a bank statement showing that credit card linked to it. They send you several email 'requests for verification' a day.  This order of mine was under $100,, some a reorder. I ended up telling them just do whatever they want I'm not sending my credit card again with half hidden full numbers plus bank statements. Their customer service was so arrogant and told me to cancel the order.",1,27/07/2023
"When they offer free gifts its a scam as you will never get them. I have had a lengthy discussion with them over my experience and after everything was said they offered $10 as a gift as they new i was right and within minute or so the sent another email stating by no means was this gift a way of saying it was aa scam and not to many people complain. As for the items you buy Absolutely cheap rubbish . Their careless, unreliable couriers throw parcels at the door , break orders and Temu literally do not care. Their customer service is a joke! Seriously can anyone speak English in Australia anymore, it?€?s out of control. Be very very wary about ordering anything from this crap company",1,27/07/2023
"The quality of the products is mediocre. Many of them already come defective. But they refund instantly in the Temu credit, the value of the defective products received. It's not a big deal, because in this way it forces you to buy other equally bad products from them.",3,27/07/2023
Brought a shaving kit from Temu beautiful items lovely box shavers total crap one shave and the batteries are flat won't ever recharge complain they don't reply waste of money terrible non assistant customers services don't waste your money   Yes that?€?s all well and good you writing your reply below And l have contacted you with my reference order number on your contacts below however you have still not responded Dated today 28th February,1,27/07/2023

Don?€?t you ever order from this company ! Their products are like a 1$ store toys!! Not safe ! Seriously dangerous if plugged ! Others not functionning???????????? Never Again!,1,27/07/2023
Very disappointed! I needed to buy an item for my daughter's costume but I wasn't able because it was less than ??15 even though the end sum with the delivery was going to be around ??20. Shame on you! I'm never going to use it again.,1,27/07/2023
Only delivered half of the order not including the free gift that was the main point of the order. Reached out to their customer service and they said will refund items (although still waiting for them to confirm this) that have not arrived but will not honor the free gift. As this was the point of the order left feeling conned. Dishonest company and I would avoid by my experience.,1,27/07/2023
"For those who do not get their item or you are refused a refund for no good reason, just do what I did when they sent me a shirt that looked NOTHING like the one I ordered. They told me I had to pay the outrageous cost of shipping the item back to them- and they would only refund half of the price I paid for the shirt.You heard that right- I would be charged more money than the shirt is worth to ship it back AND they still won't give me all of my money back over THEIR mistake. So I contacted PayPal and disputed the charge, giving them details of what happened. PayPal and credit card companies, know how most of these online, ""cheap price""China based companies operate. My dispute was authorized and I got a full refund from PayPal within a day or two. Shopping with any China based companies is a huge gamble at YOUR expense. If your items arrive at all, they are often the wrong items, much smaller than the size you ordered,or such cheap quality, that you wish you had not ordered-:and they will make you pay the cost of returning them and will give you little to no refund at all. Dispute the charges, learn a lesson from it-and stop giving these crooks money!UPDATE- I've been notified that I need give my FULL NAME, email address, phone #, and order # or my review might be removedASK THOSE LEAVING GOOD REVIEWS TO DO THE SAME PROOF OR REMOVE THEIR GOOD REVIEWS!!!I don't believe ALL of those reviews are legit, so they should also prove it or remove them!!!",1,27/07/2023
"Do not trust this company, all they are after is your bank details, if they don?€?t scam  you at the beginning they?€?ll do it a little later. They have trustpilot in their pocket and they?€?re constantly taken down peoples negative reviews for no legitimate reason saying it has been stated that I?€?m not a true Customer, this is true because I?€?d never even got past the order process to receive an order number. They just took my money from the start three times.  Highly sophisticated Scam. If you don?€?t believe me, just go and have a look at what the FBI say about this company.Let?€?s see how long it takes for this to be removed.  No doubt they will come back to me saying can we help, can we have your order number, as I have stated I paid with Apple Pay. Some sort of glitch on the payment so I?€?ve done it three times until I realise something was up checked my bank account for three days after no money had left my account All of a sudden three payments for ??59 99, when the original thing I was trying to purchase was ??10.99. You have been warned!",1,27/07/2023
I find temu quite good all together as all I ordered gets delivered. It takes a few weeks but that?€?s okay. The items are not bad either. Most are really good and at such a cheap price they are just as good as getting the stuff from some cheap shops in uk - guess what the cheap shops by from these places so don?€?t diss them.,4,27/07/2023
I bought few beach towels on Temu and generally speaking I am pleased with my purchase. They are not top quality but are ok and usable and were fairly cheap once I added delivery costs. I would say you pretty much get what you paid for from Temu but it suits a purpose if you require a cheap version of something. They do tend to bombard you with constant  notifications on the app so I am probably going to delete the app if/until I need something again from it.,4,27/07/2023
"I had 2 faulty items from Temu and I got my money back, no questions asked.Excellent customer service",5,27/07/2023
Tempting prices attract buyer But Temu is associated with worst delivery partners. People dont get thier items. Temu is hopeless with a dark future. This company won't last long until they get reliable delivery partners.,1,27/07/2023
I have ordered so many things from your company and now I'm trying to return some of them and they're trying to give me less money for them and telling me oh well when you return them we'll decide how much we're going to give you back but they're brand new all the boots are brand new it's not my fault they're not the size they're supposed to be they're very small they run very small and they're very narrow so I can't use any of them and I'm sorry but I don't think it's okay that you guys don't reimburse me for the full amount because that's what the lady I just spoke to was telling me so I'm really upset about it and I don't know that I will order anything else from you guys I'm sorry considering it cost a lot and I spent a lot with you guys and now I don't even know if I'm going to get the full amount that I paid for it when they're brand new and still in the packageThat is wrong and unfairBut I appreciate the lady that I spoke to on the phone she was very kind and really tried to help but I think it's out of her hands maybe you should reconsider the way you run your company cuz I know the rings that I'm returning they say they're still in silver but they're not cuz they're turning brassy color so I want to return them but I'm not going to get the full amount back for them which is not okay that's kind of dirty and scandalous.,1,27/07/2023

"I had heard positive and negative stuff about Temu. So I decided to order for only 21??? to first try it out. And I am thrilled. Seriously, the delivery guy tried to call me for 5mn (because my dog was out and he was scared) and as I didn't reply, dropped it behind the mail box. Thank you to him for putting it there. So many delivery guys don't even try to call me and go put it in a ""point relais"". The frames I had ordered were well packaged and they totally respected the delivery date (I actually got it one day in advance). Thank you very much Temu! You'll say thank you to the delivery guy too. I will definitely order again. :)",5,28/07/2023
"They say you get ??100 back or 100% rebate. So they add pages with discounts, ive spoken to customer service it is just a con to get you buy more stuff!.

"They have very good products at a low price. Their customer service is also excellet.  Today, one of the items from my package was missing.

"I snagged a Hub 8 In 1 USB C Adapter from Temu, aiming to make it easier to charge several USB devices at once. The price was right, and given Temu's track record with me, I had high hopes. True to form, the adapter delivered ?€? compact, efficient, and exactly what I wanted. Not more, not less. As for customer service, I for one never had any issuewith past purchases. Everything was was swiftly handled. Although I must say the recent hike in the minimum for free delivery is a SLIGHT downer... but it hasn't deterred me.JUST A HEADS UP: be ready for a flurry of emails and messages post-purchase. But for the deals you're getting, it's a small trade-off!",5,28/07/2023
"Been made to wait everyday for a delivery for 5 days n keep getting told to wait no real solution to an issue all u get is scripted response , no delivery updates now for 3 days, they can contact there distributors which makes this seem like a scam and fraudulently acquire your money then lie about delivery , offer u money to keep u quiet n go away",1,28/07/2023
"Refused refund claiming the faulty item that was returned wasn't in parcel of returned items, it was. I even have proof as this has happened before so I always video packing and sealing, as well as evidence its been collected. Why would I want to keep a faulty item!? Even with evidence they just refuse. I packed it with lots of paper stuffing for protection, which could easily have pulled out the wallet with and throw away by accident, or dropped on floor. Its only ??3 something but still very annoying!I have tried contacting, several times, still refusing, so the reply given is for show and no intention of refunding me what is owed.",1,28/07/2023
"I placed an order with a specific item in mind but had to add to the order more items to qualify for the minimum spend.  It has now gone up from ??10 to ??15, in the UK that I would have preferred to have seen up front, before I got to the payment stage. This is not transparent and actually is quite difficult to select more items ad hoc to bring the total up to the minimum spend amount. That said, I received the order in a timely manner, before the due delivery date and all products were of good quality and acceptable standard.  An item in the order was unsuitable when it arrived so I asked to return. Temu said I could keep,  donate etc the item and refunded immediately to my original payment method which I really can't fault. I must be very fortunate that I have not experienced the problems some negative reviewers have written about here. My only concern is that the rise in minimum spend could have been clearer from  the start of the ordering process and hope Temu will accept this as feedback. I guess if you've never ordered from Temu before,  you wouldn't know so not really a problem.  It will make me think though before any future ordering. I don't understand what the spin thing is about that pops onto the screen so I ignore it.",5,28/07/2023

90% of all the products we buy are of very low quality.  I do not recommend.  for single use at best.  We enjoyed the good prices but were completely disappointed with the quality. Trash.,1,28/07/2023
"I have been using Temu for about six months now, on a 2-3 week basis, and have found them to be very reliable in their ads, prices, delivery times, and quality of their goods. If there is an issue with quantity or quality they have always been obliging with righting any short-comings with a refund (credit) or free return. Deliveries are quick with a credit if late, the quality is better than good, and variety is huge. The prices are inclusive of tax so what you see is what you pay and they accommodate PayPal which is reassuring. There has been a recent change with a minimum shopping charge for free delivery going from $15 to $45 which I find a bit off-putting for those with a tight budget, but this new condition is the only negative I have found. Give it a try.",5,28/07/2023
"Part of my order (???50 worth of goods) never got delivered. The delivery company marked the parcel as delivered. Temu refused to help me stating that the parcel was delivered and they have no proof. After doing an investigation with the parcel delivery company , they confirmed to me that the parcel was lost and issued an official letter stating this. I sent this letter to Temu, but even with this they refused a refund giving a reason which does not make sense. Completely ridiculous, cannot believe I?€?m spending hours on this.

"I have to support this eshop, because today I have stopped shopping at its bigger competitor definitely ( customer protection is poor now, many scammers operate there). I have placed a few  orders here( Temu) and I was satisfied with prices and delivery time . It is pity they offer few products.",4,29/07/2023
"For quite a while I was hesitant towards Temu because the prices on their site for the products they are selling seemed to good to be true. After asking opinions from friends, girlfriend and family they all told me how happy they are from what they have bought from Temu. With this cost of living crisis affecting everyone I wasn?€?t really left a choice when it came to buying products for friends, family, girlfriend etc. Many sites like Amazon and other big brands have not let their prices drop due to this crisis so i chose Temu and i could not have chosen better during this time. I bought a bunch of items in bulk and it did take a while for the items to arrive which is not an issue for me but unpacking all my items i could not believe the quality of everything i bought.Each item was packed carefully and well looked after in transit. Temu have sought opportunity during this time and i fully support them in their sales and customer service as well as their business. Temu is a legitimate company and i will be ordering more in the future! I really cannot fault what i have bought! Thank you Temu!",5,29/07/2023
"I buy weekly from temu and have to be honest, there were a couple of items that were not in good working order, but this is less than 5% of my orders and everytime it happens I got my refund withing seconds(app credit) and sometimes they offer for me to keep the item.Items are very good quality for price and I can't complain from customer service.The freebies are just a method for you to invite more people, so I don't do those.Love that sometimes the items on my basket do get cheaper than they were before I added them.Can read the reviews here and honestly, either I am lucky as hell, as I order weekly, or some people are a bit mistaken.Also the reviews about the couriers make no sense as that's not Temu's fault.Hope they make a fidelity program or a product review program as I would love to participate.",5,29/07/2023
"Obviously some items are a little sub-standard,but others are great value.I gave a review complaining about a small clock that was faulty,when I received my next order a replacement was included,good service or what!. I shall certainly keep ordering.",5,29/07/2023

I ordered 3 times, yea, some of the stuff was smaller than i thought but overall pretty good quality, all worked,  good sturdy stuff and so cheap. CS was good, i had a missing delivery and they refunded no questions. yes delivery isnt 1stclass because of the country but thats expected.",5,29/07/2023
I purchased some resort wear but when I got it the quality was terrible and cheap Disgusting shouldn?€?t be selling garments like this I send them back in my expense $30 postage and I have been waiting for my refund but they keep lying to me every day with different story I had to file a complaint with the Fear Trading I don?€?t recommend TEMU,1,29/07/2023

Customer service is always a bad and frustrating experience. Spending hours to try and explain and understand why packages are not delivered home and have to drive to package shops and wait in line. Escalation is not even an option.,1,29/07/2023

"It is a well known fact that some online companies offer inducements for removing negative reviews or altering them. I have personally been offered a free security cam from one company. Having been reading reviews on here, Amazon and many supermarkets for several years I have come to the following conclusion:When I purchase several items over a period of time and have excellent service, I do wonder how others could have such negative experiences. Could it possibly be that they are writing such rubbish in the hope of being offered an inducement to remove it ?I have had excellent service and products from Temu and can't praise them enough. Somebody who purchases a gadget for ??1.50 then complains it is cheaply made needs a reality check. Others who complain about delivery must be very unlucky. If anything, I find Temu send too many emails with delivery times.This is the second review I have posted regarding Temu. Not because they have offered me a free BMW but because I get so annoyed at negative reviews by Muppets or maybe those hoping for remuneration for removing negative reviews. Some sellers on Ebay have 100% feedback from thousands of purchasers. To me that is definitely a red flag and any thoughts of purchasing should be avoided. Trust Pilot do their best but I guess there is no solution whilst people lack morals and are happy to leave false reviews.",5,29/07/2023

"Hi team Temu,I am writing to inform you of the following issue. On the 2nd of February 2024 I have placed an order of a total amount of 144.35 EUR with order number PO-141-21194808935031428. This order has been split up into two (2) different parcels, due to electronics being shipt to me.Out of these two (2) parcels, the first one (the digital laser meter) has arrived without any issues and is working fine. However, the second parcel (tracking #JVGL06289524000769239840) has never arrived at the specified address.I have reached out 4 times to your support on the website. Every single time you are telling me either that a) you can not do anything because DHL has said that its delivered or b) to provide proof that the package is not received by me. I have offered to send a photo of my empty hands to prove that this parcel has never??been delivered, but nothing changed.??I'd kindly request you to look into this matter with me, as I currently have the payment on-hold and am not planning to pay for any package that has not been delivered to my address.Kind regards,ReistipsNL//Update 21 Feb:Reached out through chat, they said ?€?can?€?t help you as it?€?s delivered according to dhl?€? and disconnected.",1,29/07/2023
"Selling nice cheap stuff , qaulity is fine.They send you money back real quick if you don?€?t like the order & sometimes they let you keep the order with money back",5,29/07/2023
DO NOT SHOP WITH THEM! I received an empty shipping bag which suggests my parcel has been tampered with. I contacted TEMU who state ?€?the warehouse has shipped your items?€? ?€?the package was received?€? therefore they cannot reissue or refund the items. Under UK Selling Laws they have to do something but they?€?re obviously above that.,1,29/07/2023
"Temu is very good, it's easy to order and delivery times are always kept. Some of the things I bought weren't what I expected but they gave me an instant refund without having the problem of returning the goods. You get what you pay for so if it's cheap expect cheap!",5,30/07/2023

"I placed an order on January 17. It's now more than a month and still no word on where the parcel is. I request a cancellation and no response. Initially, I received feedback that due to Christmas and New Year, there are delays. Nearly two months into 2024 and for sure these holidays can't be blamed for why until now I haven't received my order. The inconveniences and lack of communication are disappointing to me. I have one more order and these two will certainly be my last purchases with Temu. On Feb 21 I continued my follow-up with a chat at TEMU. According to the online agent, they still have no idea where my parcel is. The option I have now is to get a refund which will take days or add it to my credit. I also received an email from customer service confirming that the courier still hasn't contacted them. Well, I have no hope of getting the parcel. Unfortunately, I have another order from Temu that I am waiting for. Hopefully, this one will arrive in time.",1,30/07/2023
"Had my Info stolen! My Facebook account was connected to my temu account and after making my first order someone from Brazil attempted to log in to my Facebook using my log in details! Thankfully Facebook informed me of this and the location of the person trying to get in. I was able to change my pass world and email address associated with my Facebook account. Also canceled my card too. Still waiting on my order but I honestly don't even want it anymore after this. Deleted temu as well. Just not worth it. Similar has happened to other people too including funds being taken out their bank accounts...something needs done about it as it's disgusting,people should be able to shop safely. Sorry temu but the amount of people who's Facebook has been hacked/money been taken out of bank accounts your sellers aren't trustworthy and your clearly not either,maybe you should have a look in to the sellers from my order as my info 100% got sold? Get the scammers off!! Absolutely ridiculous reply just going to let them keep doing what they are doing without actually tackling the issue. People's info should not be at risk when buying things from your site definitely not as secure as your making out. Definitely urge people to stay away and pay the extra few pounds to get what you want from trusted suppliers like Amazon,ect. Temu  very sketchy and clearly not even going to hold any accountability to what's going on either. They just as bad as the people selling your info, ridiculous. Please don't use this site!",1,30/07/2023
"Ordered several items, still not arrived. Shiped from abroad. Products are cheap, but if you don't get them? Then your just giving your money away. Order of Amazon it already in the uk and you dont get scammed",1,30/07/2023
Deceptive images of ultra low quality products that look posh on website only but fool customer into thinking that they are cheap. They advertise them looking posh and fine photos that don't mirror the actually colour and quality. Its plain garbage and not worth the price paid and not the product ordered. Agree that they do free returns but the product will need to be returned to China where the warehouse is and it may take several weeks before you get anything back.,1,30/07/2023

I am so happy with temu overall very happy and yes UK base shops could learn a lot from their customer service I mean wow their customer service is pretty good I've read every single review almost on here before I even thought about ordering with them and watch lots online please read other reviews yourself and just do a small order to start with because you may not be happy with it but they are really good at resolving any issues you have and the fact that they've replied to every single review here I think it's quite amazing because not even big stores do that from the UK like I said they could learn a lot from them they probably wouldn't lose so many customers for buying things on these sites if they're customer service was better like this companyMy only issue that I have with them is the pop-ups on your phone from them and it can get a little bit annoying when the sharing to get credit doesn't really work very well but I guess that's no different than most apps anyway so again just be savvy and realisticI have done a couple of orders with them now long as I had to wait was for my first one which was two and a half weeks yes was a little bit annoying but they did give me the five pound credit and apologized it because an item had gone out of stock but they corrected this and gave me a five pound credit and I didn't even have to ask them I mean not even UK stores do this I placed a couple more orders why I was waiting and amazingly they arrived and they actually arrived very quick I had one item out of all of the products I ordered arrive at slightly damaged it was an apple slicer went on their chat just say that the item arrived damage sent a couple of photos they didn't even ask for the photos they were so politing kind and they literally said they will refund me without the need to return an item I can either have it go on to my account or back through the payment method however the payment method was just going to take long time as Paypal does so I just had it gone my account and she was done within seconds their custom service to be fair is amazing and I think a lot of UK High Street stores wood learn a lot from them including Amazon I had Ford activity on my Amazon account so I don't use Amazon anymore yes I've heard the rumors about temu but I find them like shien but more home stuff available love both sites.To be fair I haven't had really any major issues with my order out of all the items yes one were slightly damaged it was probably damaged during shipping but out of all the orders I've had from somewhere like dunelm that's UK based 9 out of 12 arrived damaged or broken so I'm absolutely amazed with this company that's not based in the UK some of their prices are a bit like yeah probably wouldn't pay that for it but then if you just add it to a basket eventually I have a drop saw Rises in price so you know I just keep an eye on things it is a bit like a market granted and you have to be savvy with the things you buy Yes I would recommend using something like PayPal and not using your credit card information because it protects you however I use PayPal with a lot of UK based stores as well because I don't trust them as stated up above I had a thought on my Amazon account when I used to use Amazon so can happen anywhere at any time so I would always advise people to just stay safe online but PayPal is probably one of the best safer options and they accept it so why wouldn't you use it,5,30/07/2023
"Avoid this site, total scam, Luckily i try with small order to test and thankfully did not spend that much money, Order something from November and never got it back. wrote them to inform and they send some links that are not useful at all.

There is a plethora of items to choose from, and granted enough, some may be cheap and not so fancy, but thats the point of buying things like that. A pair of wireless earbuds for ???3.79??€? where would you get it, and they do the job just as well as more expensive ones. When we do an order on Temu, its like been a child at a sweet store, picking what you want. I dont  know why there are such negative reviews, as I have never had issue with them after about 12 or 13 purchases. Although everyone has their own experience. They even offer rebates if their deliveries are late. I think Temu rocks, and ill be looking forward to my next delivery?€? its like opening a Lucky Bag when the delivery comes.",5,30/07/2023

Please change this because I don't want to have to pay an extra ??13 if I just want to buy something that is ??2!,4,31/07/2023

"I use to purchase from wish.com that turn out negatively for me because of their unreliable shipping practices but then I tried our Temu. Their products seem to goo to be true but we tried them out with a few small purchases; shipping within (7) business days, they also have reliable tracking.  The majority of products we've ordered are legitimate sometimes to good to believe but temu has a great return or exchange policy.  I truly believe in Temu and recommend this website too all my friends and family.  Temu is truly an awesome website.",5,31/07/2023
I Started sending orders as soon as they opened up to Canada.   Have received many items..  most have been very good value..  all problems are quickly resolved and refunds given.  I have tried a few others in the same category that have cheated me and cost me money..  TEMU has never done anything of that nature.,5,31/07/2023

If I wanted a credit, I would not have returned the items in the first place.

My fellow Canadians...beware of this company. Heed my warning!",1,31/07/2023
This is my favorite online store! In fact I am so addicted with them that I have ordered from them for more than 170 times already. Majority of the stuffs I get are nice though there are a few so-so items here and there. But you cannot beat the amazing prices here. They stretch mg dollar to the max.

"Package turned up open and 3/4 of order missing temu , won't refund as apparently all items where in packet when it left the warehouse im ??15 out of pocket and they not interested",1,01/08/2023
"I'm very disappointed with Temu. Many people were tempted by cheap prices from Temu, but it comes with a price, which is cheap quality. Initially temu service was really good, but they seem to change the policy now. Things that come faulty, damaged or any reasons, you have to return it first then get a refund after. And not all the time they refund you thru your bank card. Sometimes they refund you back to Temu credit balance despite your original payment is actually thru your bank card. This is a gimmick to let you keep buying in Temu. Also, speaking about the return, it also mean an item that cost only 50cents or a dollar, they'll ask you to return it in order to get a refund. Many people does not live near to the UPS, and to drive to UPS just to return the faulty items worth 50cents to $2, the gas is already more than that, moreover the time is totally not worth it. Its really kind of stupid and ridiculous from Temu. Shipping is also godamn slow. Imagine buying from Temu, waited for weeks and finally arrived, but to huge disappointment, items all came with really poor quality or faulty items, (I remembered mine were the juicer that is not working, a jacket that has spoilt zip, pants with holes and some other cheap stuffs that cost less than $4, all were of different timing and different orders), spoke to agent and agent ask me to return all of them. I have an order of few dollars worth of items, and I have to drive to UPS to return items that cost less than $4 altogether. Ridiculous. How is your feeling for that if you're the consumer? I would advise to think twice if you really want to purchase in Temu. It's good if its cheap and comes with good quality, but it's really a complete hassle and disaster if items are all of cheap and poor quality and if you wish to get a refund. And I would say majority of the items in Temu, like 80% are of poor and cheap quality, all from China made. So think twice before you buy!",1,01/08/2023
"I think Temu is great. very reasonably priced items. Surprisingly excellent quality... for all sorts of things...Some items are questionable, and very poor quality. Just read the description, and what is made of...",5,01/08/2023
Pathetic service. It?€?s been 20 days I have sent a return to Temu and they have received it 15 days before and still haven?€?t issued me refund. And from last one week I have been trying to contact Temu n their representatives always say it?€?s under inspection (Temu website says once they receive returned item it takes 1-5 business days to refund) they ain?€?t helpful at all and it?€?s ??197 order and I am running behind them but they ain?€?t answering me. A good store never takes 15 or more days to do a quality inspection. Pathetic they are thief.,1,01/08/2023
"I love this website - I have placed so many orders and everything I have received has been lovely, I have ordered clothes, items, home items and never had an issue with any of the things, it does great bargains and to be fair, yes it is cheap but it is also very good. Always happy with my parcels and I keep ordering more",5,01/08/2023
Really what I have faced with temu is a problem from their end delivery it was bad delivery and bad workers but about TEMU as a company she fix everything from her side to end include that the shipping was fast and team assistant especially YARA I appreciate her for what she done for me thanks Temu.,5,01/08/2023
"Free delivery on everything, how cool is that? I gave it a shot to see if they're true to their word, and bam, they nailed it! Got my stuff in just under two weeks, smooth sailing all the way.Now, if you're on the lookout for something easy on the wallet and don't mind trading off a bit on quality, Temu's the spot.Had a little hiccup with my account ?€? not sure if it was me or a glitch on their end. So, I hit up their support through chat. They've got this bot pretending to be human. Took me a bit to catch on, but soon enough, it was clear ?€? the ""human"" was just a bot trying to play it cool????I get it, keeping costs down with those sweet deals and free shipping, but pretending to be human? Not the move, Temu, not the move. Keep it real, always! ????",4,01/08/2023
"Update: Feb 16 2024Temu with their automated scripted reply at its best. If they use UPS then why was my order shipped through a chinese company in the first place. They want me to give them an order ID which will result in the exact scripted response no improvement just more false hopes to justify their delays. They want to offer credits what a joke like we would want to use them after the snail delivery with a great list of scripted responses. They just proved my points below.Zero if there was a choice. Temu will promise you shipment within a 2 week timeframe but they deceive you there is no such thing as free shipping it comes at a cost to you as a consumer, they will not meet their set target dates or aim for the last date and make excuses saying its the weather or logistic or carrier issue or back logged because of peak times. Supai Express their carrier is a joke you call them no answer, leave a voicemail still no answer with a status update for shipment. Shady company as well.The process: order placed online, wait a day then says shipped then wait time 5 days or more before finally reaching an airport. Next excuse they are trying hard to get a flight more excuses. Then wait another few days before it gets on flight then another day or so for 2nd flight then another few days for the carrier to pick up and deliver ...so if you placed an urgent order good luck more excuses it will not matter to them. They will entice you with credits, coupons and act like they care to profit them at your inconvenience. They will refuse to cancel and give you a refund and repeat their standard scripted responses. I believe they wait for a quota of orders before they ship on flight to cut their overhead cost but they will not be honest with their customers. I have placed many orders in the past and shipping was fast (arrived on earliest estimated target date) that's why I chose them since they proved to be reliable with low prices and  reasonable quality products. But now it appears their focus is to spend more money on marketing campaigns than to value and meet their customer's expectations. I am still waiting for 2 orders but shipping is a snail pace and has impacted my project work negatively. 1st order was late even after I had checked in several times with their customer support team which I never had to do in the past. I placed the 2 other orders within one day of 1st one. If I knew the outcome was a bad one I would have never placed the subsequent orders. I learned my lesson and will intentionally support local businesses not international ones like these no matter how cheap. I will never again purchase from Temu after the orders hopefully arrive in time since they refuse to cancel for a full refund even though they are/were in ""shipped"" status for days. If Temu were transparent and upfront about their logistics we as customers would be making more informed decisions before placing orders to avoid the unnecessary frustrations and disappointments. The norm for most reputable businesses is to achieve high customer satisfaction by exceeding expectations to build loyalty and trust but not for Temu obviously.",1,01/08/2023
"So,  just signed up to Temu and ordered a few items. Will review again when the items arrive.",4,01/08/2023
You get what you pay for. 99% of what ive received was exactly as expected and 60% cheaper than amazon,5,01/08/2023
"I was initially quite wary of Temu.com. However, the incredible prices warranted a small purchasing test. They passed this with flying colours. All the products were received within the designated timeframe. I had to return one item due to it being the wrong size and was immediately refunded once it was delivered to my local post office. In my opinion Temu would become more popular than Amazon if they were able to keep those prices with a UK distribution centre, which would equate to days and not weeks for delivery.",5,01/08/2023
I've been buying from TEMU last 6 months and they are absolutely excellent. The products are very good value for money especially the clothes...The whole ordering delivery return refund process is excellent and quick...I would rate 10/10 Thank you TEMU@,5,01/08/2023
Personally it's been great for me. Bear in mind you get what you pay for and you'll be pleased.,4,01/08/2023
So far experienced is good my order was supposed to arrive on February 14th but hasn?€?t arrived yet and also on tracking order hasn?€?t reached the wherehouse. I will see when they will deliver the products. I will wait and decide to continuously purchasing from temu,5,01/08/2023
I purchased a pair of trousers from Temu for around $30.00. They didn?€?t fit so I sent them back via UPS. The cost of shipping them back was $18.00 and change. This was several months ago and still have not heard back from them. Looks like I?€?m out around $50.00. All my other purchases from them were great.,5,01/08/2023
I ordered a Shih Tzu decal. I couldn?€?t get out of the packaging. Luckily my nephew came for a visit and he was able to get it out out of the package and we stuck it on my mirror in the bathroom. It looks so cute. I?€?m changing my rating on Temu. It?€?s not their fault that I couldn?€?t get the sticker out of the packaging.,5,01/08/2023
"Order ID: PO-210It has happened again. I selected size 7.5 trainers size which was delivered today at 15.08. Apparently, size 9 was delivered instead of size 7.5 UK. This is the second time it's happened. Regards Juliet Orafu 07866 264 441",3,01/08/2023
"Don't deserve 1 star this is an utterly crappie company. The sell cheap rubbish that takes ages to arrive when it does and you return it they then reuse to refund you and just ignore you as if they didn't understand English properly. If you don't understand English don't sell crap to English speaking people. AVOID AVOID AVOID. THEY ARE NOT BACKED AS LEGAL SELLERS People also askIs it safe to buy from Temu?Are the products on Temu good quality???Temu is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and has an average rating of two-and-a-half out of five stars. Many recent complaints about Temu on the BBB website say that items never arrived or, if they did, took weeks or even months to arrive.AS I SAY AVOID AVOID",1,01/08/2023
First purchase with temu. Ordred 5 items which came to ??10 so cheap. Beautiful scarf earrings eye pencil earring backs and a make up organiser which retails on Amazon at ??12 i got it for ??5 on here. Takes longer to arrive but if you arent in a hurry to get a product its really worth it . Also good tracking service . Im very happy.,5,01/08/2023
First time using Temu I was very wary as so cheap but I was happy with the clothes I ordered especially for the price I paid and I will be ordering again from them.,5,01/08/2023
"Absolutely sick of this company, on all 3 occasions ive used this site ive had silent international calls, either they are silent or ring a few times just to see if my contact no is active, fraud emails (i use a particular email address soley to see if it is these) I will never use these again! Im not saying the DO but ""selling customers contact details"" comes to mind!!!Update - Didnt deny it in their reply!",1,01/08/2023
"Update: Another review Temu flag saying not genuine, Temu this getting ridiculous accept criticism and stop revoking bad reviews it's a true review with your fake promises.I love Temu but I have noticed negative reviews getting removed I also provided proof to trust pilot.Placed several orders and said would all be here by valentine's day, what load of lies.Also noticed they moved the delivery date to avoid paying five pound late fees.They don't put dates anymore they now say 5 to 10 days, basically could take months.So will use AliExpress again it's cheaper and about same delivery speed. If going to wait this long might as well get items even cheaper.If fact Temu is actually quite expensive compared to Shein, only reason used Temu was because shipping speed.But as it's snail ???? pace now for delivery ???? not worth it.",1,02/08/2023
"Products are better and more consistent than Ali Express but delivery is taking longer and longer and prices are hiking. It claims to have shipped, then 7 days later manages to reach an airport. They obviously put a lot of effort into getting things out quickly when they first started out, but it's on its way downhill. I don't think this is accidental. It's still worth it if you don't mind waiting 2 weeks, but it used to be a lot better. *I've amended my review to 4 stars. I do think the shipping times have gotten worse but it's still excellent value for money and the products are usually of a good quality for the price.",4,02/08/2023

"I ordered my products on February 4th 2024 and the tracking says it will be delivered today, 14th February. If Temu is now in NZ, why does it take so long for the delivery?",1,02/08/2023
"I got an order. The light were broken upon opening the package. I returned them. Today, a couple of weeks later I decided to cut and put down the anti rug slip base. Meant bringing up the hall rug and cutting it to size. Problem was the item was junk and did not stop any movement. There was not grip to it.Asking for help is like banging your head off a wall. Customer service is just copy and paste people. They must not go off script and in no way allowed to help you. If you sent something back because it was broken, then try and something else back because that item is not as described. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR RETURNS. No exceptions, no help. You are meant to wait up to a month to make sure everything is good. If it?€?s not then it all goes back together. Unfortunately this company is going to spread like a bad rash. They simply do not care. I?€?m going to delete my account as soon as my last order is delivered",1,02/08/2023
"I am a 66 year old pensioner.lol.I have bought loads clothes from Temu.Very happy with the price and quality,also no shipping costs.Only thing is,as a silver surfer who cant sleep much this site is quite addictive in the wee small hours.lol.",4,02/08/2023
Order item of Temu. I'm in UK my settings are in UK. Nothing indicated the USA including prices in Stirling.  Order an item. Their choice 9f delivery was through Evri which is part of Hermes Parcelnet basked in Plymouth UK. I received emails from Temu in the UK saying my package was arriving.  I was in and then I received another message that a delivery had been attempted which was a complete lie. A couple days later I received an email from Temu saying my package was going to be delivered between 5.30pm and 7.30pm I was here and there was no delivery. At 5.38 I received another message from Temu saying they tried to deliver but something wenot wrong. I messaged Temu through Facebook as there is no other way only to be told I'd ordered through USA. Well that's also a lie. Terrible company and even worse delivery firm. DO NOT BUY THROUGH THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE NOT LEGITIMATE AS PROVEN THROUGH THEIR NON EXISTENT CONTACTS.UPDATE 14.02.24Received message from Temu that they have processed a refund. I do not have an account with Temu as I ordered as a guest. Apparently upto 10 working days. The response below is a pre-typed (see other negative reports) . I am assuming that I am going to have the same difficulty as the others when it comes to an actual refund. I've been asked to provide my purchase order number on here as verification however this will link to my bank card details so I will not be doing that as per my banks advise. It will negate any action my bank is taking. Apparently my bank can throw a pop-up if I now go into Temu stating it is not a trused site. I will update if/when I receive a full refund.,1,02/08/2023
temu is great to use cheap and  quick delivery times however my friend doubts that its safe due to some controversy I believe in good quality products and temu supplies,5,02/08/2023
"I am very impressed with Temu. I ordered a lovely coat, however I ordered a size too large. I can't believe how easy the return process is. I am in the UK and within minutes of the carriers, ""Evri"" scanning my QR code, the full payment was credited to my Temu account and I was immediately able to order an alternative garment. Well done Temu! Well done Evri. The quality of goods is excellent for the most part, though as far as I am concerned in the future, I have no worries ordering considering they have such an efficient return process.",5,02/08/2023
I have bought many items from this site since it first appeared. Mostly a hit sometimes a miss. What I like the most about them is their very simple and easy return system if something isn?€?t as pictured or the quality isn?€?t as expected or it doesn?€?t work. You can find most things on their site cheaper than anywhere else and you just have to be aware that you get what you pay for. I have been 90% happy with my purchases to date and if not I simply return them.,4,02/08/2023
Never had a issue. Always got my orders only thing is time it takes to come. But consodering its coming from other side of world its acceptable,5,02/08/2023
Edit?€?.Received my refund now after making this complaint.WHAT A JOKE OF A COMPANY. I HAVE RETURNED AN ITEM AND THEY ARE DENYING MY REFUND AS IT DIDNT HAVE A BARCODE ON-BARE IN MIND THEY KNEW WHAT I WAS RETURNING AS THEY SENT ME A SPECIFIC CODE TO SEND THIS BACK. THE STAFF ARE USELESS AND JUST FOLLOW A SCRIPT AND THERE IS NO MANAGER OR CONTACT NUMBER TO SPEAK TO A HUMAN.I KNOW NEED TO RAISE A CHARGEBACK THROUGH MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY AS THEY HAVE THE ITEM AND MY MONEY.,1,02/08/2023
The glass jar arrived broken on the little pieces.The cake pan is all crumpled!It?€?s very very bad quality and service.,1,02/08/2023
Hi I have waited a long time for refunds there is no way to actually contact them Hitting dead ends everywhere nearly ??109 I'm waiting on They take it instantly from your account  but beware the other way a nightmare,1,02/08/2023
The attractive prices and free shipping ( nothing is free in this world ! ) entices people to buy here. Alternative to amazon. I have purchased 3 times from them now. Kitchen storage containers and rechargeable night lights were some of the products. The hinges on the containers were flimsy and broke very easily and the sensors in the lights don't work anymore. All just outside the 90 days guarantee period. Also they 'discontinue' products very quickly and put the same up again in a different ad. I would never buy anything from this site again. Shop local if possible and spend a little more. All the useless products end up in our land fill or in the recycle bin. Beware,1,02/08/2023
I am a Temu customer who has been surprised by their quick delivery and how the delivery is tracked to your door. The return policy is absolutely spot on refunded the same day as received if there is an issue. The quality of goods is on par with your cost you cant expect a gold bar from a lead smelter.,5,02/08/2023
"The delivery was quick and haste free. Purchased again a month later and once again the process from purchasing, tracking, delivery and after sales service/communication was great. The goods were as described, the quality will be tested in the future and the price was exceptional. Had heard that downloading the app would expose you to personal tracking, don?€?t believe the gimmicks are need to keep people buying their products if all continues as has been the case. At this point in time, very happy and will update if it is necessary.",5,02/08/2023
I have spent quite a bit with Temu since finding it about 2 months ago. So far I would rate it ..overall ..excellent..But read the product ads and info carefully...to avoid problems...their refund and delivery policies are great and..they follow thru..I am so presses I bought shares in the company after a couple of purchases,5,02/08/2023
"Not very happy with temu , I been they customer for a while now and from start was everything perfect specially delivery always on time , last couple of orders I can see delivery take longer they expected, even now I'm waiting for package witch was send but no any updates for 6 days now I don't think I will be ordering from temu after this as I can't get straight answers from customer service",1,02/08/2023
"I hate the delivery timeline; it takes too long to get your items deliveredIf you are shopping for a time-bound event, do not go for Temu because they will fail you...... 5 dollar payback does not suffice for any pain they will cause you for their shabby service",1,03/08/2023
"I order here regularly and never had any issue. I like all the items I got. At ??10, it's already free delivery unlike other sites where the minimum is higher. Will keep using this.",5,03/08/2023
"I really was impressed by Temu. I placed a $15 order a while ago and was amazed at the quality. The biggest thing is reading reviews and product descriptions. Their crystals are legit, but pictures can be deceiving so READ THE DESCRIPTION. Same rule applies to Amazon, but temu is cheaper. I placed another order, which is supposed to arrive tomorrow!",5,03/08/2023
"I made a recent purchase with temu and while i noticed it was taking a bit longer than usual I was surprised to see it marked as delivered and signed for when I checked..on inquiring I was told to check with neighbours as they might have it..I checked the cctv cameras and seen the driver throw my parcel in to the wheelie bin when he got no answer, I find this sinister for a few reasons ..he left no note      txt, message of any kind to inform me where my package was ..its also sinister that I didn't notice the package in the days that followed as i used the bin a few times thet week and would have noticed my package sitting on the large cardboad box i put in that morning..temu were very promt in issuing me a refund but I have to say I have no faith in any company that uses that courier company .if any representative of either company's want to review the cctv its no problem",1,03/08/2023
"The range of products was just what I wanted.  And there was free delivery advertised on the front page. Only when I got to checkout did I find that ""Temu has order minimum thresholds, .... Our order minimum thresholds are detailed before you submit your order."" That is correct but very annoying. Why don't they say up front (like Amazon does) that the minimum order for free shipping is whatever it is? I cancelled my order.And now I get a response from Temu talking about sustainable packaging - don't they read the reviews? The point is that they could do better to warn potential customers about the minimum order when they promote free delivery on their front page!",2,03/08/2023
Excellent service and products..I made an order by mistake then asked for a refund and to my utter disbelief they returned the amount within one working day..the products came smoothly and I was well informed about the total shipment process. Had awful experience about online shopping but this site forced me to restore my trust again.. hope to be their regular customer and also expect that our satisfaction will be paid honestly. There will be no fraudulent regarding our payment instructions or the quality of products in future. Keep going Temu.,5,03/08/2023
"BEFORE BUYING CHECK THE REVIEWS.  There is something clearly wrong with a company that has a fairly equal distribution of horrible reviews and positive reviews. It tells me that when you get your merchandise you are happy but when there is a problem their support service and guarantees are useless. This is compatible with my experience.  When something goes wrong, and eventually it will, you will get no support and turn into a very dissatisfied customer.Temu's guarantee states, "" Temu works with reliable shipping partners around the world. We guarantee that your package will reach you safely and on time. If there are any problems during the transit of items you purchased, such as damage, loss, or delay, rest assured that we will do our best to solve the problems and provide the best solutions.""  Temu contracted with a carrier to deliver a package.  The address given to Temu clearly states an office building address with a Suite number.  The Temu chosen carrier chose to deliver the package on a rainy Sunday and, when the whole office building of some thirty separate offices was locked, they elected to leave it on a sidewalk outside the office building. Temu was contacted and despite their guarantee this was their response ""We have investigated this issue and our team has confirmed that the correct items were delivered to the correct address. Please check your mailbox, around your house, and other possible locations. Sometimes packages can be left in unexpected places"" and they refused to accept responsibility.  Temu is wrong on multiple accounts.  Let me list a few.  First they chose unreliable shipping partners. Second the package did not reach me safely. Third, the address given to Temu clearly states an office suite and the correct delivery would be to that office and not to leave on a sidewalk outside the building. Fourth, there is a documented picture of the package being left on a sidewalk so the location it was discarded is documented and to check other locations is demonstrably fruitless.  Fifth, Temu's refusal to follow their guarantee and use common sense is demonstrated in their repeated refusal to just use common sense. Temu hired the delivery service and they expect that the customer should just forfeit the funds utilized for the purchase that he did not receive.  This leaves no other recourse than to challenge with the credit card company.  There are two major lessons from this experience.  First, DON'T BUY FROM TEMU. The price may be a bit cheaper but the aggravation and lost packages more than erase any savings. Second, if you feel compelled to buy from Temu make sure you use a credit card so you can contest the expenditure and expect no help from Temu. Temu?€?s response is inadequate as I have responded to Temu.com to get the standardized answer.  Then Temu proceeds to challenge this review by claiming it is an unvarified purchase. Obviously, Temu has a scripted obstructionist policy to frustrate and try to  block negative reviews. Don't expect any reasonable help from customer support.  They have standardized obstructionist platitudes to make you feel better but without any help.",1,03/08/2023
"Thus far I've made two purchases. Both times I received broken items, as they were very poorly packaged. I got my money back, but this is no way to conduct business, especially when you have a 15??? minimum order limit. I've been ordering online for 20 years (including countless purchases from aliexpress) and I've only received a handful of damaged items. Temu already has a 100% failure rate and that says a lot about their service quality.. It's highly unlikely that I'll buy from them again.",1,03/08/2023
Real warning for this company fraud on a new level I have a virtual credit card when I bought from temu and they have tried to withdraw over 300 dollars from nowhere it is true many say they withdraw money from your credit card never buy from this platform Plus that I have started receiving strange emails and SMS from China have never given my details to a Chinese company and then you can understand that they are selling your personal details be careful and do not buy from this platform,1,03/08/2023
I love shopping on Temu I have gotten a lot of nice quality items I must admit I love every single item that I ever bought from them Never had a bad experience I always received my item on time and if not they credit you $5 towards your next purchase.,5,03/08/2023
"My second time using Temu, I was supposed to receive 2 packages from them. I recieved one package but it was intended for someone else, my address label had been put over someone else?€?s. After several discussions via chat a Refund was issued for the first missing package. After several more weeks of trying to get a refund for the second package they have refused and closed the complaint. They claim that they have photo evidence of both packages being delivered. The photo of the package was clearly the wrongly labelled package. Im assuming something went wrong with their shipping & labelling company. But by the looks of things I?€?m not the first person this has happened too. I won?€?t be using their company again.",1,03/08/2023
I have had nothing but positive experiences with TEMU. Can?€?t fault them.,5,03/08/2023
Received an email offering 100% rebate up to ??50 however when I purchased items I then received email saying my order was to late for the rebate,2,03/08/2023
"Many people look at Temu with suspicion for the very low prices and discounts. I ordered dozens of items, every single one arrived well on time and in great condition. Yes, these are most simple household items but I don?€?t need luxury rubber bands or drain plugs. Even an electric milk foamer costing 8 euros works perfectly. If you know what you?€?re buying the most economical solution to buy from Temu. Highly recommend.",5,03/08/2023
"As sizes differ I have to order different sizes and consequently return items. I want to say how impressed with the speed refunds are credited to my account, sometimes a couple of hours after refund authorised. Everything I have ordered has been as expected and exceptional value. Would definitely recommend.",5,03/08/2023
"I started using Temu early last year and I have to say that my experiences have been great. I have bought a variety of different items, clothes, boots, shoes & kitchen gadgets and it has been an A??? experience for me. I have found the quality very good in what I have purchased. I have ordered a couple of things in the past and had to return them, but this was done without incident, money back in my account without any issues. Also I have dealt with Temu's customer services via Live Chat a couple of times AGAIN no problems. Personally, for now if I need to buy anything I do check on Temu first, before looking elsewhere as to date they haven't let me down. In my view definitely a 5??? experience all the way.",5,03/08/2023
"They don?€?t accept exchanges, have a convoluted returns policy, and are no help with resetting accounts. Their customer service had no idea how to change an account if the email used for the order was no longer available. Could I unlink the return from the previous email address? No solution. Could I return product using order number, my bank details and a new email address? No solution? I had to suggest ways of getting around the problem rather than them and they still couldn't solve it.",1,03/08/2023
"I recived my order, It was a screen but it arrived shattered so if I touch it I will get cut. I contacted temu support but they dont want to give me my money back.",1,03/08/2023
"I was surprised about order limit at my first purchase.This was 10 Pounds than and for now it is raised to 15 Pounds !!!In my opinion limit is unfair, because most of the time I just need small things.Therefore usually I choose another online shop. There is no other problem.",4,03/08/2023

"Company contacted me regarding safety alert and stated dispose of item, which i did, and also request a refund.Went through the process, need to return the item to process refund. Unable to process a refund because of their 90 day policy. Contacted customer service put simply 'absolutely useless' never use again, they sell tat. IF I could change it to no stars i would i had a response. The link they sent me DID NOT WORK",1,03/08/2023
"I was a bit dubious when first ordering with Temu, but was very surprised with the quality of some of the items, they are great, some are not so good but then what do you expect for the prices you pay! I have bought clothes and shoes, which have been lovely and a better quality than I expected, most fit well, but if they don't, you just refund and return. I have had no problems with Customer Service.I have also purchased household replacement products for branded mop and duster for a fraction of the cost being charged in shops and they are of a great quality.Toys, games, false nails, cosmetics all for the grandchildren and they have loved them.My only moan, which is why I didn't give them a 5 star, is the delivery time at first was unbelievably quick, but now is slowing down and taking a lot longer, but that said, they do give you a ??5 credit if the order doesn't arrive on time.All in all I am very happy with Temu and will continue to order, in fact I am currently waiting for 2 orders...",4,03/08/2023
"The best website, had no issues with anything.",5,03/08/2023
"My experience with Temu has been nothing but pleasant.  As others have said, some of the items are lacking, but for the price, and the fact that other items are top tier for the price, I am very happy with the value I get for my money.  My package normally arrives within the time frame.  There was one time when I did not receive my package, period.  I thought for sure this was going to be an issue as the delivery service stated they delivered the package.  I was able to contact customer service fairly easy, and besides wanting me to take steps that their website suggests you take before you call and that I did, they reshipped all items and those that were out of stock were refunded.  I was pleasantly surprised.  There was also one time where I received communication that, because my package was outside their promised delivery dates (which if it was, I didn't notice), they were issuing me the $5 credit, which is their promise if your items are delivered outside the delivery dates timeframe  And lastly, I too am not keen on returning items, especially how inexpensive some things are, all the way back to China.  However, I had a pair of stretchy jeans that were just too big, and I couldn't justify keeping them.  I contacted customer service, and was informed that the first item you return, you can keep (therefore it's a free return?).  So again, pleasantly surprised.  Now on the flip side of this is that they have a lot of marketing ploys.  For instance, claiming the shipping is only free for a limited amount of time, or that you are getting an item for a special price when really that price is a constant (or in the area of the same price).  I keep those things in mind and try not to react on them.  Take your time, look for other vendors that might have the same item for cheaper.  I have also received some great promo offers if I hold out long enough.  All around I have had an A+ experience.",5,03/08/2023
My order says delivered but actually was never delivered. Worst customer service ever. I complained about it got a message from trustpilot temu to give details. Nothing happened they don?€?t take any responsibility blame it on the customer. THERE IS NO DELIVERY GAURANTEE. Order at your own risk . I paid $135 and they never refunded. The company got back to me regarding order details but still no response nobody did anything just wasted my time explaining the whole situation again & again. I will keep giving them 0 stars as much as I can . NEVER EVER RECOMMEND,1,03/08/2023
Products are cheap but quality not good.,3,03/08/2023
I had placed items in my basket before Christmas and changed my mind as decided i didn't want to purchase.  I didn?€?t place order but Temu placed the order for the items I had in basket and deducted an ?€?automatic payment?€? from my paypal account. They will not accept responsibility and refund money for fraudulent transaction.,1,04/08/2023
Not so great,5,04/08/2023
Order PO-210-14196457457270615Temu does not send what you have paid for   Send articles broken (a vase all the inside distorted). I bought and paid for several items including 2 leather jackets.  One they did not even acknowledged that I purchased although they cashed my money!I have the email acknowledging only ONE OF THEM.  That they said was with the British customs and would arrive by the 6th Feb.  They stat that the item was fully refunded but in the email message that a ??5 was added to my account for the delay!!!!  I cannot access my account!!!!THEY ARE STILL SELLING THE LEATHER JACKET that sadly THEY HAVE NOT REFUNDED ME FOR.  Why are they selling an article for a lesser price without having it?????They said my order number does not exist although this is the number in their email to me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY FROM - Temu -they are trouble.  Lots of other problems DO NOT BUY FROM THEM you will regret if you do.Remember the jacket they have NOT sent to me to date it is still selling in their websire!!!!  Where is the jacket I paid for them?  By the way I cannot access my account at all!!!!!!!,1,04/08/2023
"My order came very quickly and all together in one package which was great and I got 3 very cute dresses with free shipping for $35!But?€?. the sizing is not accurate!I got S which is supposedly an 8, but I needed to have ordered XS which is a 6.I know for next time!",4,04/08/2023
"When I 1st ordered I wasn't expecting much due to the cheap price, and the things that I had heard. I was surprised with the quality and they do let you know if it not there by a certain date you will receive a voucher which I think is good. I now use this company when getting my grandaughter and grandson clothes.",5,04/08/2023
"Temu is a scam. They sell you poor quality products and I have been going around in circles to get a refund for items that have never arrived. Lots of shipping issues and delays in getting refunds for items never received. I paid a lot of money for the last order never received and yet no refund. Waste of money and time. And they collect your personal data to use as they please.Update: Temu's response here to my review is pretty much the sort of ""sweet talk"" I have been hearing from Temu for the last week and yet I have received no items or refund or any form of action. They are very good at talking but you still end up wasting your time and money. And they will use your data to constantly bombard you with ""deals"" based on your purchase history as they think people are stupid and would fall for their scam repeatedly.",1,04/08/2023
Ordered multiple times never had a problem delivery is okay my package usually arrives 9 days after ordering which is pretty good prices are amazing for the products you receive.,5,04/08/2023
"As with all asian sites of this type, carefull what u buy, reviews are well,"" swapped about "" .....There are some good bargains on here ( clothes ,however are sized woefully tiny) everythings easy to order as no p and p,and it all comes on time..but,,prices are getting higher now, finding ebay etc is often as cheap,,, good delivery speed though, and any refunds quickly sorted..only real refunds i have had ( exept one)were postal probs ,not temu",4,04/08/2023
If Temu used a decent courier they would rate higher. I had a parcel dropped into the foyer of my building and was not notified.  There are about 400 people go through the foyer each day.  My last order has taken 8 days to cross Auckland. Now they can't find it. It certainly puts you off using them.,2,04/08/2023
"A great website, but not the best I have been having some referral issues I don?€?t know if it?€?s the device or if they have done the referral before but I do see myself not getting a lot of the referrals and I recently had a $65 cash out that failed because of my last invite I guess the coins were with Drew or they were taken back because I guess it was something wrong found in the referral process, but I was told by my referral that they have never used the website before and I was unable to get my $65 PayPal cash out I have bought things from Temu before without there ever being a way to earn money before there was ever a minimum fee to get your order delivered. I was a Temu user before it became popular, and since it became popular, there?€?s been so many bugs, issues, spam, emails spam ads that take up and clog my screen and I am not able to do anything and it allows for the app to freeze my phone and make my phone laggy and I used to really like this app because they had a lot of use for products and ways to earn money and could there be another way besides inviting people to earn money because I?€?m pretty sure the whole world knows about Temu at this moment thanks for the reply and as always of course i will get in touch with you guys thank you so much (update currently playing fish land. It?€?s a game where you supposedly supposed to earn credit by inviting people same thing so you?€?re able to invite five existing users and two of the users. I am not able to redeem because it says they?€?ve been invited already, but I?€?m the one that invited them again still having issues with the invite process even though I contacted the company and as per contacting the company like I was asked to do so they then turned around and told me that I needed to invite more people so after inviting 11 people they will decrease the amount of earnings. You owe all the way until you are at two cents one cents, so you have to invite way more than 11 people. Now you have to invite 27 people. Temu is starting to go off the deep end. I take it all back. Temu is terrible. Do not waste your time do not.",1,04/08/2023
I got my first order and I am happy. Now how can I pay with PayPal for a secong order?,5,04/08/2023
Placed an order....temu app says it has arrived but courier confirmed that my package was not there...again after five days temu app showed that my package arrived on 06th by 11.00 pm...but again courier confirmed that temu has taken back the package... Still no answer from anyone and this company seems to be using public money for weeks or months and may return back...,1,04/08/2023
"I have been using Temu for almost a year now! I have found them AMAZING!! Their stock is endless they have everything you could ask for and more! I buy from them almost on a bi-weekly rota, and am ALWAYS pleased. Only 1 time I had a broken item and that was the lid was snapped off small a storage box for wires and I believe it happened in transit!! I gave ordered everything from vegetable peeler to dresses, jumpers and shoes and ALL have been absolutely great!!! Don?€?t hesitate to use them. I am in Scotland and delivery is pretty quick,  being it?€?s coming from so far away!!",5,04/08/2023
"Absolutely woeful. Product is ok, shipping is fair, but delivery in Australia is pathetic. Have been notified today of 4 orders that have been delivered under the 1 consignment. So they were all packed together, but i didn?€?t receive it. Asked for photo for proof of delivery and it as left 2 foot (60cm) from the footpath on a street used by 100?€?s of people a day. If he walked another 15 steps he would have been inside the foyer of my apartment block of 4 units. All Temu does is duck shove you around to the delivery agent, who won?€?t give you a straight answer and their phone numbers are bogus. As I?€?m housebound due to knee replacements and oncoming shoulder replacements I make at least 2 purchases a week for myself or other people as gifts. ?€?NOT NOW?€?. Avoid them like the plague",1,04/08/2023
"I like the products and have made a couple of orders but there are too many that I can't get shipped to my current address which puts me off ordering.It used to be way better but it seems just as one example anything with a blade, anything bb gun related etc they won't send here. This is just an example.There are other platforms that will send us the products we want to buy and this actively stopped me ordering today.",4,04/08/2023
Everything great for a few months until parcel shop stolen my ??75 parcel and they didn't refund or resend. They firstly treated me as a criminal and ended offering ??18 voucher for their shop. And insisted I already collected.,1,04/08/2023
Ordered solar lights for in ground lighting. 4/8 of the lights don?€?t work. I tried to contact them. There appears to be no avenue for this. Tried to upload photos and contact for help but the website only wants me to return the items - there is no return docket in the box. Wouldn?€?t recommend using this site.,1,04/08/2023
"I have been using Temu for two years and always found the items are good i have spent hundreds of pounds,and enjoy every parcel,designs are different from any i could get in the uk,and i feel special in my different from everyone else clothes,any items i dont like i simply return and am refunded as soon as the parcel has been sent by the p office,i have never had to follow up on anything i buy,the service has been great and i have asked many things and got swift polite answers,this is an amazing site with like most shops good or not so good items,and like shops can be returned and refunded,thank you Temu for an excellent service Izzy x",5,04/08/2023
"I have been a loyal customer to Temu for quite some time and I have never encountered this big of an issue. Their shipping has always been inconsistent but not like this. On Jan 15th I made a $300 order. I received 2 out of 3 of the packages within a week. I started asking where my 3rd package was that has 20 items in it. They can?€?t tell me where it is, no shipping update, carrier has no info on the package at all. I reach out and am told if I don?€?t see an update I will get a full refund after 15 days. 17 days pass and they put a fake shipping update on it that doesn?€?t even exist. I?€?m now 22 days no update and been given the run around for almost a month. I?€?ll never use temu again.",1,04/08/2023
"Ordered t shirts, never arrived, Temu promise ??5 if items are over 35 days late, contacted customer services, complete waste of time. They just will not confirm their policy and will not live up to promises-don?€?t buy from them unless you want dissappointment",1,04/08/2023
"We've ordered many items from Temu and have been very happy.  But our latest order was a mess.  My husband bought 2 pairs of shoes. Both were the incorrect size.  Not the size he ordered.  We sent pictures, as requested on the Return/Refund link and Temu refuse to acknowledge their error.  They say the warehouse says they sent the correct size.  Yet, we have proof that the correct size was ordered on our Temu order. The worst part is that all their responses are automated... So we're going around in circles.",1,05/08/2023
"In January I ordered an air compressor and rechargeable torch for the very reasonable price of ??12.66. My credit card confirmed payment to Temu.com. With no confirmation received, I logged on to their site which unfortunately  did not show any orders in my name. They have a service ?€?Can?€?t find you order?€? suggesting this is not unusual but that didn?€?t help. A long irritatingly repetitive correspondence with their contact/ help service followed including sending a screenshot of my card payment. Eventually Temu claimed to be unable to locate an order or payment from me, repeatedly labelling it an ?€?unauthorised transaction?€? and indeed suggested a family member may have misused my card! Exasperated, I decided to write off the small sum involved and to have nothing to do with Temu in future.     Astonishingly, today Feb 5th, an air compressor and torch have been delivered from Temu despite their repeated denial that I had ever made an order! These items seem of good quality and well worth the money and in isolation would deserve more stars. However the chaotic ordering process and follow up leaves me with little confidence in this company.",1,05/08/2023
"Ordered a couple items from Temu, this is the second time I have ordered from them. My issue is with their shipping which is free. With both of my orders they provided me with tracking info that I believe is misleading. They send a notification that the item has shipped and provide a tracking number but if you check with the shipper you find that the item has not been delivered to them, for in my case 6 days after Temu indicated it had been shipped. If they cannot be honest about shipping what else will they be dishonest about? I cannot understand why an online company would want to deceive a customer in any way, just be honest.",2,05/08/2023
"Order from them regularly, everything always arrives within 2 weeks and I have always received what I ordered. The quality can be variable but is usually very good, even when it hasn?€?t been the best, it?€?s certainly worth whatever I have paid. The real risk with purchasing from them is you order far too many things that you don?€?t actually need!",5,05/08/2023
"Always delivered promptly, cheap, affordable, and great quality!",5,05/08/2023
"Thankyou Temu , for being an affordable items website , & for prompt delivery ;)",5,05/08/2023
NEVER AGAIN! I purchased items from Temu and they were left in the rain I received a package that was soaking wet. I paid ??118 for this package and the process to get my refund has been horrendous! As the item arrived damaged I am eligible for a refund under purchase protection policy. I have spoken by chat and called Temu customer service over 20x and not getting anywhere have send pictures of package received damaged and completely returned the item and still waiting for a refund I am getting emails saying that the warehouse is busy and keeps taking longer! Absolutely unacceptable. I am going to make a TikTok about this and let people  know absolutely not worth it this is the first time I ordered from TEMU will be sticking to SHEIN from now on. Not worth the hustle guys spend your money elsewhere! UPDATE! To add insult to injury they gave me a partial refund for exactly half of my order (to the penny) as apparently only half was returned! Honestly I cannot deal with these people I have asked for the warehouse footage to proof only half was in the parcel which they have literally pushing me from pillar to post and not getting anywhere they still have 59.34 of my money. And I can?€?t even complain to the ombudsman service as they are not based in the Uk they have literally stolen my money! I am actually shocked at this! I am not going to stop until I get my last penny back from them. This is the first time I ordered and NEVER AGAIN,1,05/08/2023
just amazing but i think it is cheap metariel idk,5,05/08/2023
"Good experience with TEMU. I entered my wrong address due new phones auto correct, so my fault. They delivered and took a picture. Quite a large order so I went to find it. No sign but helpful neighbours tried their best to assist me.I explained my error to TEMU and the resent the whole order at their expense, which I've now received, Can ask for more than that.I can only recommended them. I don't give 5 starts as no one's perfect but if I did these guys would get 5",4,05/08/2023
I was expecting poundland quality but I am 100% happy with my purchase and I have even had over a month to try it all out.The constant bombardment of marketing is off-putting but if you can endure it then I think you will find something worthwhile.Delivery was quicker than expected too. I will buy again.,5,05/08/2023
Very cheap and poor quality absolutely waste of money!,2,05/08/2023
Today Vijay Karan came to give me my parcel which I was expecting. He delivered on time and that isn't anything new he is also always friendly.Last week I took a parcel for my neighbour and gave it to her. Feel free to contact me.,5,06/08/2023

"Why do you sent to the wrong city every time it is PostNord?No problems with DAO.Now PN refuse to change/deliver to the right city, because they said its your fault! Tried your chat, only got the stupid robot. I've also tried to be sure that the package I'm expecting won't get to the wrong city, with no luck.So, what can I do??? This is so frustrating and takes so much time ??????So annoying!",1,06/08/2023
Thanks Dear for your Wonderful Service & Good Qualit??tLove it Like it TEMU...,5,06/08/2023
"Gave Temu a try after positive feedback from friends but found it a bit lacklustre. Difficult to navigate around the site with so many ""flash"" offers coming through and far too many emails/WhatsApp messages. Products were incredibly cheap and not as good as the photos, but the socks I ordered were nice. Ended up sending most of it back. Free delivery and returns is good and it didn't take as long as I expected to get my refund but I have now deleted my account and wouldn't order again",3,06/08/2023
"Happy customers, thank you very much for UK Temu app , not happy good receive it contact the company and refund give it to me all good now thank you very much again !!",5,06/08/2023
"I am pretty new as a customer but have ordered quite a few bits in 3 orders (so far)The positives, I so far have had no problems with delivery and received all of my items on time. Some of my bounty has been really good value ie 2 handheld vacume cleaners (rechargeable) ??4.48 each which worked really well and I can make a saving on by charging early morning when electric is half price and using when I like. They even went down to ??3.03 at one time. They were well made with soft buttons and easy clean. Good for sensitive hands. Some of the shoes are amazingly light and comfy. 2 pairs of Leggins the softest most comfy I ever had (both under ??4.00) and many more deals I'm really pleased with.Negatives just make sure you read the reviews as some things are not as expected. Read and check (sizes and materials) ie sometimes the shoe reviews may mention they come up small (so go up a size) and some of the materials are not quite what you'd expect. I've only tried to return 2 items and was told to keep them and I could have a refund immediately is Temu vouchers or back in bank (the cost) in next few weeks of I chose vouchers as I have other things I need.There is so much choice and some very unusual things to pick from. Ie wall banners (giant) to change the feel of a room. Better than wallpaper and less damaging(plus fun) good for kids rooms.I rarely buy online but flowed my daughter there and am really happy I did.Also one order I made I cancelled almost immediately and was fully reimbursed within a couple of days. Into my bank.Altogether a good fun experience.",5,06/08/2023
"Never a problem  ordering or with order what do people expect your paying pennys for fun stuff its not going to be top quality but its of an expected usable quality,",5,06/08/2023
"I have placed many orders with Temu, and of course you have to be careful what you buy.I had 2 parcels that Evri didn?€?t deliver, I notified Temu and they credited my account within hours.I bought something that was faulty, they refunded me.I bought something I didn?€?t like, they refunded me.I have bought lots of things that I am 100% happy with, things that sell for 4 times the price of Amazon.Husband moans about what I buy on Temu, but I caught him browsing their site ????I think their customer service is excellent and yes the notifications are annoying, but so what. I shall continue buying from Temu and have nothing negative to say about them.",5,06/08/2023
I have bought a lot of things from Temu. Some things I returned and got refunded no problem. One order didn't arrive and they refunded me. Their products are cheap and mostly ok. I will continue to use them . My only complaint would be having a minimum at ??15 . I wanted to order a pair of sandals but couldn't unless I made the order up to that amount . All in all though a good company to deal with,5,06/08/2023
Temu is a legitimate place to order; prices are incredible. The quality of the products are good/great not excellent. The reason why it's so cheap.,5,06/08/2023
A fraud company no parcel delivered and just showing fake photos they come to conclusion of delivery and they are not refund my money took my money and reverting with different emails. They are big scammers,1,07/08/2023
"I have ordered dozens of items from Temu, and I must say my experience has been fantastic.I have had the pleasure of placing numerous orders with Temu over time, and I am thrilled to share that my overall experience has been nothing short of exceptional. This online retailer has consistently exceeded my expectations, making it my go-to destination for a wide range of items. Let me delve deeper into why my encounters with Temu have been so fantastic.First and foremost, Temu's user-friendly website deserves commendation. Navigating their platform is a breeze, and finding the items I need is an effortless process. They offer a vast and diverse selection of products, catering to various needs and preferences. Whether I'm in search of the latest electronics, fashionable clothing, or home essentials, Temu always seems to have what I'm looking for.Furthermore, the convenience of their ordering process is truly remarkable. From selecting items to finalizing the purchase, everything is seamless and hassle-free. Their transparent pricing, along with detailed product descriptions and customer reviews, provides me with the information I need to make informed decisions.",4,07/08/2023
"I did not receive three items in my bag. When I talk to customer, there's nothing they can do for the warehouse said they sent it out. I asked to talk to a supervisor they told me there was no supervisor that can help me. Just went on for about 20 to 30 minutes finally I just gave up. Honestly I feel that they don't care.",1,07/08/2023
Everything at Temu is miniature. All the products have misleading pictures that make the products look normal size. You MUST read the dimensions very carefully (if they bother to provide them). It takes weeks for stuff to arrive. Generally it is just better to search on Amazon for the same thing and MAYBE pay a little more. Some things are the same price or cheaper on Amazon.Temu has recently upped the minimum order to $25 (was $10) so you have to search long and hard to find enough cheap crap to get to that threshold.,2,07/08/2023
"I put 33 items in my cart nd check out. All of sudden, I got a notification on my order but only for 20 items. I went back into my account nd saw 13 items in my cart and asking me to check out again and make payment. My previous order was definitely scammed too because I sens all I ordered for did not arrive and those that arrived too forever. Temu is ?€? NOT TRUST?€? many of my friends saying the same thing. Whatever they order for come half or missing items. Temu is scam!!! You will never get the total of your items and it will take forever to receive your order. I chatted with Cherry to no avail. The customer service representative is ???? she argued with me for more than 1 hour. She said before I check out, I have to select the items I want. But I did not select any and they only processed 20. Why should they process any if the rule says I have to select? And why 13 was left in the cart and asking me to check out again nd make payment. You also don?€?t get all you paid for, nor getting them as scheduled. Beware!!!",1,07/08/2023
"Both my wife and myself purchased products from Temu and received the items we asked for with in a little over a week from the date we ordered so to be honest we are both very happy with our purchase and products,  "" as the saying goes say what you see "" so well done to Temu on service and products  and prompt delivery,  We both will purchase again from Temu and would recommend them to friends and relatives Yours Tom and irene ORiordan",5,07/08/2023
"Edit - temu have you looked in to this yet? Only I haven't heard anything. If I could give 0 stars I would.I ordered a 5in1 foil, parchment, plastic bag etc dispenser. It arrived today but it was nothing like advertised. I received a 3in1 dispenser which is considerably smaller than the one I ordered plus it wasn't engraved like the one ordered just cheap stickers. I contacted temu customer service and they have told me there is nothing they can do. ""we are unable to support your return/refund request, we cannot assist you further"" I sent them images over of what I received and you can clearly see they are nothing alike. They are refusing to help me and I'm now out of pocket by ??16 I'm raising a dispute with klarna and hopefully they can sort it out. Temu are honestly disgusting, it's also not the first time I've had a problem. I had a order that went missing and they refused to help me with that aswell and said it wasn't their responsibility. Won't be using them any more. I hope they get closed down",1,07/08/2023
"I've been using Temu now for a long time as my go to place online shop site. I've never had to wait more than a few weeks for stuff to arrive.

I've bought trainers etc from Temu, good quality & I've saved a fortune.",4,07/08/2023

"What is wrong with this company?  I ordered empty artists watercolour pans which are fine and the price was ok too.  However since ordering, they have spammed me unmercifully.  My inbox is full of notifications about the packages - yes, the order was split into 3 parcel so treble the number of emails and texts - for no reason.  I require one email per package and then I will track it.  When I went to pick up the packages, I really couldn't tell which email was the relevant one to show to receive my package.",2,07/08/2023

"Update I received today February 4th 2024, after you, temu, told me to contact customer service again. :Dear customer, our warehouse team, let us know that your package showed no deviation when preparing your order. That all your item(s) regarding your order were present when the package left our Temu warehouse. Therefore, we cannot issue you a refund or reship.------- can you explain then to me where all the missing parts went during shipping? ????PO-020-21857038172793080Ticket Temu Number???1706815029020016Can you explain please? Not a very great experience! They had send me 2 trolley's, 1 was complete, the other one was missing several parts. So useless.I just had surgery, still in the hospital, can't return it. I was ordered by the app, when reviewing the items, to go to customer service, since parts were missing. Sometimes they are very understanding and helpful. Today and yesterday were horrible. It was like talking to a robot.They kept repeating the same sentences the whole time, not listening or understanding anything of what I was explaining to them. Yes them, coz I had to go into the chat a few times and each time got a different operator of course, which didn't bother to read what was going on before, so I spend hours in that chatroom and they kept me waiting for so long!!! One time even an hour!! Com'on ????They were stressing me out, I told them that, same reply on repeat. One even when I told her she was tiring me coz she refused to understand and could only repeat over and over again, just ended the chat, just like that ????Zero understanding for my situation. If Temu would have send me a complete item, I would not be here. Now I have to pay for it and it is not complete and it's not functional?! How is that good service???Zero understanding, zero service. I understand now the other bad reviewsVery very disappointed!!!!It's now been a few days talking to their service team. For hours. They told me, they need to have a meeting, whether they were going to refund me those 30??? ???????????????? .......seriously!!!!They keep repeating like a robot telling me I have to return the package. When I keep repeating, I can't coz I had back surgery. I'm in the hospital, can't wrapp it, can't take it to the post office. But they don't listen. I almost went crazy yesterday.So frustrating. Like talking to a wall. Today I got an email with update after they had their meeting.????Result:I need to return the package to get the refund. ????????So, proof they don't listen, coz I literally can't. And why? They are the ones who have send me an incomplete item, with many missing parts of which I showed them evidence through pictures. It's their fault. Evidence is provided. Now paying for something that is useless?!!! What kind of service is that?!!Unbelievable ????????????????",1,07/08/2023

They have the nerve to Flag my review. You can Flag but still not help even with proof. Your team on customer service don't even honor your review request like you stated here. Your review is for the public to think you solve problems but you don't. Especially when it's dealing with a large amount of money. The only company were customer is not right and even if they are you won't help. Please don't pay attention to Temu review they are not genuine. They will flag to protect company reputation.

It says within 3 minutes, but i was informed (after 30 minutes of language barrier issues) that MY ""instant 3 minute credit"" would not happen for days or weeks because of special items i returned- a sweater and a bag? Not sure why those are so special, but basically the return credit will not be credited until they receive and inspect my items. I'll be deleting my account after i get the refund because if they are lying about such simple things, they are lying about others. Also, if a company is doing business in a foreign company, they need fluent speakers of those countries native languages in customer service. The economy sucks and i was looking for cheaper goods as a result, but the lies, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, and headaches are NOT WORTH IT!",1,08/08/2023
My very first purchase was a pair of leggings. This is the only good thing. My second order for about 100 euros?€? all kinds of cleaning /massage tools were all directly into the garbage bin. This site makes you feel that they have things that make your life easier. But it only makes it worse. Don?€?t waste your money.,2,08/08/2023

"You can not write back on Temu review again after you write them a bad review. They said they do not respond for the missing  items after they sent to me. No refund!!!! Temu get money, I get nothing and mad. !!!I called Temu customer service about week, one of your supervisor tell me Temu no responding for my lost since Temu warehouse said they shipped to me all the items with good condition. The missing stuff on delivery Temu no cover it, end discussion and hung up the phone on me. This is the Temu customer service.",1,08/08/2023
"Felt like Bait And switch. I was offered pop ups I didnt see again on my receipt. And with no way of contacting anyone about it and the refund process heavily leaning towards future credit instead of money back, I dont think I'm ever going to order from temu again. Started good but slowly getting worse. Im glad I started printing my emails from them also. Because things change! Like my emails!!!! Dates appear to change so I screen shot them with another phone. My biggest complaint is the pop up that said pick 5 items for like01cents each or a dollar each can't remember which. But either way it said to spend $25 to receive that special price. I do so and they weren't in my cart at check out and I have no way of getting them I'm there. And the refund issue I was talking about was from an item the the price changed between when I 1st saw it's and when I checked out. I was offered store credit Instantly or refunded back to my account in 1.5 - 2 months. But had the ability to add anything to my order for next 2 hrs!....... --To reply to your responce- my complaint wasn't about the credit or refund, my original complaint was about the pop up that said I could pick 5 items for. 01cent each after spending $25. I picked the item out of the pop up. Then spent the $25 needed to receive the 5 pop up items. Then the pop up items disappeared. That is my complaint. The other stuff was thrown in when Trustpilot asked for more info. Well they got!, Guess make sure you want what you ask for. Like they say(take what you want but eat what you take).. and maybe stop with the pop ups if there not not really an offer!",1,08/08/2023

"I have received all the items I have purchased. You need to look very carefully at what You are purchasing. If You see a watch and the price is $5 then You would be only buying the watch band.  if the object is very cheap then expect to receive a cheap or inexpensive item. You need to check the measurements as many items are small or very small.   I have purchased many items over the past 4 months. All items have arrived in good condition. The postage only takes about 14 days usually whereas ebay can take 28 days or more.. I did complain about a car seat cover I had purchased [had no padding] but they just refunded Me the money and I  kept the item. I have also received the $5 credit if the parcel isn't received in their time frame.  Just triple check what you are purchasing - if it looks like it can't be made for that price then the item maybe smaller or made very cheaply .

This company uses coupons to lure customers and when I went to use one on a recent order it never took it and charged me the full amount. I contacted a rep and after having me on hold for several minutes comes back to inform me that coupon was for the NEXT order. Nothing in their process gave any indication that the coupon was not to be used for the existing order. In any event they could have honored it and given me a heads up the next time. They chose not to and I chose to cancel the order and now write about it.,1,08/08/2023

"I was browsing on Temu and added a series of items to the cart. As I was at work, I did not complete the checkout, as I was awaiting confirmation on sizes, before completing the purchase. The total of my shopping cart at the time, was ??13.80. I received a misleading email, which stated ?€?Your cart has seen a large price drop!?€? I clicked on the email and was brought back to the shopping art, although, encountered the same price of ??13.80. The price of the cart had not dropped, as wrongfully stated. I complained to Temu regarding this misleading advertising and they responded, stating ?€?the discount is already applied?€? Nothing within their email, nor the terms and conditions, specified that the discount was already applied and the price would remain the same. On the contrary, their email falsely claimed the price of my cart had dropped when it had not changed. This was passed to their complaints team, who responded by stating they would send a 20% off coupon as a gesture of goodwill and this would be received within 24 - 48 hours. I followed up 48 hours later as this was not received and I was then told that my complaint was with the wrong department and it must be transferred to the relevant team.The relevant team responded, with the same nonsense.For two weeks, they have opted to try and blame me for their own false advertising. Wrongfully stating that I needed to click on ""apply"" which was not an option anywhere within the email / checkout cart.The agent that I spoke with ""Catherine"" of the ""Customer Support Team"" has no place working in the realm of customer care and she is a complete waste of space.They are a shameless company and will blame customers for their errors and blatant scams.Due to their continued efforts to divert blame, I have flagged my concerns with the Advertising Standards Agency.Temu will be familiar with this process, as they have been fined for their illegal advertising approach in the past.Moreover, I'm not filing litigation for this blatant false advertising.In future, be a responsible company and accept responsibility for your oversights. Instead, you have opted to act in the most immature fashion possible and divert blame.Disgraceful people.*UPDATED REPLY*Your response is again, absolute nonsense.For over two weeks, you have opted to blame customers for your clear and obvious case of false advertising. You have attempted to abuse the Trustpilot flagging system and report my review as being ungenuine, in a lamentable attempt to have my review removed. The relevant evidence has been provided to show my review is genuine.As i stated to your terrible support team, you are attempting to lie and deceive to a professional marketer. Should you have acted accordingly and accepted liability, the matter would have been closed.Your terrible team do not place customer care or satisfaction as a priority and instead opt to lie and blame customers for your own oversights.As stated, this has been escalated to the Advertising Standards Agency and you will face litigation for your continued attempts to deny this obvious false advertising.*UPDATED AGAIN*Temu is now opting to misuse Trustpilots platform, falsely flagging reviews that are based on a genuine experience.You offered a pathetic gesture of goodwill, hoping that I would ignore your blatant false advertising.I have provided Trustpilot with sufficient proof of my experience and my concerns were passed to the Advertising Standards Authority.I am now raising a separate complaint with Trustpilot, as your actions are an evident breach and misuse of their terms of service.",1,08/08/2023

"I am surprised at the low rating for this company as I cannot speak high enough of them.  Their policy of not having to return small items and keep them but still get a refund is an assurance that I can order things that may not be to one's liking when arrived, though I have been very happy with everything.  Some clothing and shoes have had to go back, but that is often the case with other companies.  All in all, especially for the price and free deliveries and returns, I love this company.  Their customer service via chat is great, answers quickly and always solves a problem.",5,09/08/2023

Temu has taken responsibility and.given me credit so I can replace the items so I would like to thank them for that I've upped my stars also stopped evri from delivering my parcels in happy with that. Ty. Temu won't take responsibility for delivery drivers irresponsible delivery on top of a bin in full view of people walking past. Plus I was in and they did not knock on my door like a delivery man I supposed to. I only found out after Reading a  text to say parcel delivered several hours later when I went out to get it it it had gone ???? Now saying nothing they can do they delivered to my address. ?,4,09/08/2023
I was not expecting top tier merchandise but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of their products. Shipping is relatively quick considering the distance. The only negative I have is the sizing when it comes to clothing or shoes but that seems the norm on the internet. I purchase a shirt and a pair of pants last year and I believe the size was about a size and a half small. The slip on foot wear was about a 1/4 size small but I still wear them to run out to get the mail. I've had orders since but not clothing.,4,09/08/2023

"You get nothing but cheap trash sent by Temu. They?€?re warehouse staff are incompetent who do not quality check before shipping yet they want to quality check when items are returned? I once ordered shoes and there was only ONE yes ONE shoe in the box!! Last week I received a ring which was not the ring I ordered, They replaced a ring that cost me ??4 for a tacky cheap ring which when checked on the app was ??1 as it was clear the ring I ordered was out of stock. HOW DARE THEY!! Instead refunding me for the item, they sent some cheap rubbish to replace it thinking I won?€?t notice? Nearly every order I have made with this company, I have had to return 90% back wasting my time, printer ink and paper for the return label. I will also state, Temu may seem cheap but if you actually look around, Shein are alot cheaper. Shein offers more incentives to their customers, with coupons and points and better customer service. Temu is just a rip off company who bump up prices then drastically reduce items after 24/48 hours. You offer ?€?price adjustments?€? which goes towards your temu credit so basically you are forced to shop there again spending minimum ??20. I get sent countless defective items, either damaged already from warehouse or damaged in transit as they have a habit of shipping 2 or more orders in one postal bag. My last few parcels weighed 3-4KG. Why make customers spend minimum ??20 for free shipping when you are shipping previous orders together?? SCAM and DECEITFUL. Yesterday I receive a hot water bottle within my order with a broken lid. I called their customer service and was asked to return for a refund or partial refund of ??2 when the item cost me ??10, WHAT USE IS A HOT WATER BOTTLE WITHOUT A LID?! These customer service reps have zero common sense! All they do is say sorry but never resolve the issue. Absolute CON!! This whole company is a joke and wish I hadn?€?t spent so much money and time with them. After receiving my refunds, I will be deleting my account and removing the app. UPDATE: Got an email from Trustpilot as Temu has flagged my review as they don?€?t believe it to be genuine. WHY WOULD I LIE?!! My order numbers for the items I mentioned in this review are: PO-210-19063329147512868 and PO-210-02570681549432868. You know very well I called your customer service to complain. Spent over 1 hour of MY time on the phone as all your rep was doing is putting me on hold. At the end was told to return the hot water bottle if wanted a full refund and just said ?€?sorry about the ring and refunded which I was sent a completely different ring which was alot cheaper than the one I paid and ordered for?€? NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Bunch of ????????. Can?€?t take the truth? YOUR SERVICE IS POOR",1,09/08/2023

2 x illegal transactions from Temu. Recovering money via credit card. Needs shutting down really.The nonsense response from Temu below says absolutely nothing. I have 2 items on my credit card from Temu which i never ordered. I went back to my bank and they immediately credited it without delay. It is obvious and clear that Temu is fronting scammers. Just avoid them completely if you don't want your bank account draining.It should be noted that the Temu scammers then proceeded to challenge my position with Trustpilot. However Trustpilot were offered evidence confirming that the Temu scammers had credited my card back as a result of this review....Do NOT use Temu unless you want your bank emptied.,1,09/08/2023

"I ordered after recieving a promotion offer for 100% rebate up to the value of ??50, & I read online this can be in cash to your account, upon the arrival of the goods you order. However, when there was no mention of said 'rebate' whilst checking out, or confirmation emails. When I finally got through to someone who could help using the 'contact us' section, they said that the rebate was in the form of discount vouchers upon spending a further amount. I wasnt happy about this and insisted I would not have spent that in the first place if not for the rebate, and asked for a full refund. After offering the refund amount in vouchers I again said I wouldn't have spent it in the first place. At this point they agreed to give me a full refund which they promptly sent to my paypal account. Everyone was very polite along the way and I even received a few of my items, which they have not asked me to send back. Very pleased over all this was great customer service, despite the company being in China.",5,10/08/2023
ive never had a problem with temu after ordering over 30 times,5,10/08/2023
I was very wary of this company due to the reviews . I thought I would send a small order and see how it went I was not disappointed so on that basis I sent a larger order and once again I was pretty impressed. Temu kept me informed of every stage of my delivery and I was really hoping to get the ??5.00 late bonus . My deliveries were what I expected to be of good quality for crafting products. Sometimes it?€?s worth the risk .Thank you Temu .I will be ordering again in the near future,5,10/08/2023
"UPdate: after posting this review, I got a refund for all 4 items from Temu.  I was made to feel like a liar, with items disappearing under their noses and me made the culprit for it. It is not normal to have an almost normal count of the items twice( just one missing) and then to find another 3 missing. Put cameras in your warehouse so this will not happen again. I am sure the other 3 legged it like the 1st one did. If you buy from them,  make pictures and videous of your items and even how you seal the bag, so you will not have the same experience I did. I never had this before with Temu, so I am still very angry and dissapointed. Do not buy from them or if you do, sent each order separately and take pictures. I'v sent 4 orders under the same ticket, in which there were some silver rings, 2 identical. I initially ordered one and I thought it is a size bigger than my size so I ordered the same ring again. Both were big and sent them both back. They told me that they couldn't find one of the rings, so no refund. I went back and forward with them with emails and messages, they checked twice, they couldn't find the ring, but no other issues, then they checked the 3rd time and they couldn't find 4 rings, hence not refunding me almost ??100. So, be very careful, as they will scam you. They ""lose"" items as in you have not sent them back and you end up without the money or the product. I am just speechless at the moment. How could they find all items apart 1 ring two times they checked all things and then they couldn't find 4?! You tell me, because I am at a loss. Be careful because you'll end up like me.",1,10/08/2023

Fantastic company free delivery and no problem if there  is something wrong or you do not like what they have sent - you can return 1 parcel free of charge from every delivery - have bought so many beautiful clothes for myself and my husband - clothes that I could not possibly even find on the high street and certainly not for the prices - bought so many wonderful things - really enjoy getting parcels from TEMU and you can buy just about anything you need here too,5,11/08/2023
"Hi, first of all , Temu gives wrong information about its products, at least for two of them that I have bought: cookware and Italian coffee-maker for espresso. Temu has written that they are for the induction, but they are not. I have written about it on my evaluation to prevent others, but could not find it. And I could not return the parcel because I have opened the box, it was a bit damaged, and I would pay the same price at the post office to send the parcel back. Be aware with this company! Some of other small items that I ve bought are not of good quality or do not function. It s better to pay more buying from reliable companies. I would not recommend Temu, it?€?s better to avoid it.",1,11/08/2023
"On Temu is variety items?€? cheap stuff, but I love ti shopping there ?€? just have ordered so many times before and order was always spot on - nothing was missing, came fairly quickly, lots of updates about the order",5,11/08/2023
"I have placed a few orders with temu, and I have had a couple of parcels arrive in bad condition. One was ripped open and retaped back up, very badly leading to missing items. and one arrived yesterday completely rippe,  and I am missing items. They have denied my refund, this is what it says on my request -""Refund denied After verifying with our warehouse, we've confirmed that your items were indeed packaged and shipped to you. Yourpackage was also shipped in good condition"" If a parcel arriving damaged and open is classed as good condition, then they issues! I am now out of pocket because of their shoddy packaging. I send out my parcels in better packaging as a private seller via ebay! I wouldn't recommend using these cowboys unless you want a house full of cheap tat if it even arrives!! Also everything seems to miniature in size for some strange reason, It's cheap for a reason. STAY CLEAR SPEND YOUR MONEY AT DECENT TRUSTWORTHY STORES NOT TEMU TAT.",1,11/08/2023
"Temu gives you the illusion to choose between send it home or to a pakketautomaat. They fail at both, they'll just park it at the DHL distribution center. This is the 3rd time I order and I had to drive 35 minutes to get the merch because they simply can't deliver and the Customer Service it's just a stupid algorithm telling you they can't reimburse it when that's not even the issue.",1,11/08/2023
I have been buying from temu for a few months now and i can honestly say everything i have bought has been brilliant and the prices are fantastic thankyou  temu i will definatly be buying from you in the future,5,11/08/2023
"Love the quality of the clothing items I bought, However I placed an order for a few items including household. All but one item (the most expensive one) has not arrived. would prefer the items to arrive together or be it a day or so in between. 6 days later no item and nothing from Temu.",3,11/08/2023
"Extremely poor service. If anything goes wrong with your order they encourage you to contact them through their app or live chat, all AI that just send you in a loop after loop. You get nowhere. If you ask to speak to a supervisor they raise a ticket but you get a generic response and it's closed. Save your hard earned money and buy elsewhere like Shein. Don't even bother, it's not worth it. My order was for ???172 and no refund and still not delivered. Very disappointed!! And I can almost guarantee their response to this will be a generic one telling me to contact them via the app or live chat as it has been and I have been doing for days. Stay away!Update: my refund was finally initiated after this post. Thank goodness for Trustpilot. Won't be doing business with Temu again, horrible experience!",1,11/08/2023
I had put a top in my cart it was ??8 now its gone from ??8  to ??11   !!!!   In just hours . I have been a good customer since last year .

"I've been a member of TEMU since April 2023. I've purchased some nice stuff from them. let's say 50/50. I liked free shipping, free returns and at the beginning, it was pretty good.Shipments take forever to arrive and couriers are too  lazy to deliver to the door, with maybe 2 or 3 exceptions. Mind you, I've ordered over 260 items from TEMU in less than 9 months. On January 25, 2024, I received a text, claiming my pkg was delivered. Nothing in front of door, so I went to my Lobby, Nothing! I take a video of my Lobby, no pkg received. I also repeatedly, like at least 30 times, in 3 days, for HOURS each day, sending a video of my Lobby and a photo of the Lobby they delivered my pkg to.I contacted Courier Company Straightship immediately, telling them to send Courier to retrieve pkg. They told me, to contact TEMU, they only deal with TEMU. Went to TEMU site, clicked the link, it told me to contact STRAIGHTSHIP. Should have know then and there. 3 days, hours of providing proof that it's not the same Lobby or Building. They had opened a ""Ticket"", which is a case file. I received an email from TEMU:""Dear valued customer,Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your order. We understand your concern and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Based on the results of our investigation, we aren't able to provide a reshipment/refund for this order.We have investigated this issue and our team has confirmed that the correct items were delivered to the correct address. Please check your mailbox, around your house, and other possible locations. Sometimes packages can be left in unexpected places. Thank you for your understanding.If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us directly.Best regards,Temu Customer Service""So I contact TEMU customer service, but get the same stupid computerized replies, Sorry...They won't check their previous shipments to me, where couriers left packages and took photos.Won't check photo of where STRAIGHTSHIP left my package. Won't look at the video I took of my Lobby the day of delivery.They Closed my file, claiming package delivered and I'm out $111.78.Plus I have 2 more shipments, a total of $295.13The 2 deliveries that have yet to be delivered, are being delivered by Straightship, uh huh, the same courier company who delivered at the wrong address and never retrieved from wrong address or delivered to my address.I have photos, video, saved chats!Don't Use TEMUIf your package goes missing, good luck getting your package or refund.",1,12/08/2023

**this matter has been successfully resolved. As the package has finally arrived. Temu has been honorable to their word and have located the package and had it delivered as promised. Their customer service team has been diligent and helpful. I will continue to be a patron of temu**,3,12/08/2023
"This review is STRICTLY for the Temu web portal, not the phone app, which I find too intrusive in terms of too many notifications. Temu is a dream selling platform, compared to Amazon. The prices for the exact same items are often a small fraction of what you would pay otherwise. While it is true that some items are of poor quality, they are easier to avoid if you look at all reviews and photos carefully and use a tape measure to review the dimensions (which are often smaller on items originally made for Chinese consumers). Unfortunately, most shoppers are hasty. They buy a lot of junk they don't need, often in inappropriate sizes, just because it's cheap, giving no thought to how they pollute our landfills. Show a little self control and you'll have a much better shopping experience.  So far, I have been unhappy with only one item from each shopping cart. (The items weren't unusable, just sub-par). Temu permits one free return per order -- but each return can be comprised of multiple items you purchased. To get your money back, you upload a photo of the item you received, select a reason for the return, add a few words of explanation and voila, you are immediately credited back the money you spent without having to send it back.  (Unless you choose to receive the credit back to the original payment source instead of your Temu account, in which case it takes a few days -- four in my case). This policy is so much better than Amazon's supposedly free returns since they started imposing a $6.99 fee for a return label, should you wish to use a UPS dropoff location closer to your house instead of trucking to Whole Foods, Kohl's or a UPS Store and waiting on a long line. To heck with that! Amazon isn't even faster anymore. Christmas items that I ordered were two weeks late. A part I needed to fix my washing machine that was promised  overnight (because I chose the most expensive vendor) was ten days late. I called Amazon both times to cancel so I could reorder from another seller, but was denied. Nor would they issue my refund until after these items arrived -- very very late -- and again, I had to pay $6.99 for a shipping label to avoid a long drive to their preferred drop-off sites. I'm paying $140 a year for Prime and you're telling me these are the terms? So far, I have received all of my Temu orders in 8 to 11 days (if Temu is late, they automatically courtesy credit your account with $5 or more for your inconvenience). So long as you choose your products carefully and only buy items you actually need, there is no question Temu is the smarter option.  Shoppers need to understand that it is  much harder to order online from ANY selling platform than it used to be. Item descriptions are lacking or inaccurate in almost all cases. Because so much of what is sold is mass produced junk that has been private labeled, with each distributor providing their own size guidelines, you cannot simply say, well, I usually wear a medium so that's what I'll order. You must check every single item specification and compare the measurements to articles of clothing that fit you. Don't just toss stuff in your cart. Example: Recently I was thrilled to find the same nonskid rubberized dog socks that cost me $15 on Amazon for $3.99 on Temu. The listings seemed to be identical (product descriptions and photos matched precisely), yet the Temu boots were a significantly more generous fit than the Amazon boots. Furthermore, multiple Temu sellers of the exact same booties each had their own ideas about sizing. Products listed as Large by one vendor were called Medium by a second and Small by a third. To avoid making returns, I had to evaluate how each item's measurements compared to the actual dimensions of my dog's feet. Given the rate at which humans are consuming the plastics destroying our planet, this is scarcey an inconvenience.  And look at the bottom line! I ended up getting ten sets of correctly sized dog boots from two different vendors for $2.75 to $3.99 per set, vs. $14.99 per set on Amazon, saving myself $135.",5,12/08/2023
"I was going to make a purchase of approx $32. When I went to check out, my minimum purchase amount had increased to $45. Reasons provided by bot for increase:- to provide wider range of lower priced products; may change due to promotions or discounts; minimum threshold may vary for different accounts.My minimum order value, for over 12 months, was $25.I noticed over the past 3-4 weeks it would sometimes drop to $20. Now it has jumped to $45.I ended up cancelling my order as I did not want to purchase items I didn't need.Disappointed Temu has taken this option without notification or reasoning.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *After writing my review, I was given the option to provide further details for Temu to contact me. I ended up contacting them via bot. I didn't fully understand reason for increase, however I was given the option to click an icon and presto my minimum balance was wiped. Back to 5 star rating.Thank you Temu for your customer service and following up on my complaint. ????",5,12/08/2023

"I am actually obsessed with TEMU. My husband and I have been using them since they launched here in the UK. We won hundreds of things playing the games, i wish they'd bring back more games though. Seems many people have got bored of fishland and farmland now. The app is very similar to shien or wish but I'd personally say it's better as delivery is faster and items are cheaper. Clothing quailty is brilliant in comparison too.Negatives would probably be shipment packing sometimes they are shoved into a mail bag so easily damaged but no other complaints.Still reccommed the games just don't expect Instant wins.

"The quality of items is terrible. I bought shoes - made of a very cheap plastic, very uncomfortable and awful look, the same goes for closes and home decorations. All these items don't worth even their low prices. Their only purpose - to be thrown away. The only good thing Temu does - it's their photos on the website. They look very attractive, unfortunately the reality - quite the opposite.Be aware and don't fall in trap .",2,12/08/2023
"Recieved a package which should have contained 6 rolls of wallpaper upon opening it contained 4- despite me providing photographic evidence temu has refused to either reship or refund. No delivery note in package, temu claim they have verified the package was not damaged so they won?€?t refund - it was never damaged when I recieved it. They?€?ve now asked me to return the 2 missing rolls I haven?€?t received - answers on a postcard how they think I can achieve that. Customer service agents are all BOTS the use of language makes that startingly clear.I have had a refund request denied 3 times, temu state they have checked with the warehouse and the package left in good condition. However they have numerous times failed to provide me with evidence such as a photograph to prove that there were 6 rolls in that package when it shipped. On the other hand I?€?ve provided numerous photographs of the package just opened to show 4 rolls. They offered me 20% off a future purchase up to ??20 which is an absolute disgrace as the two missing items total more than ??20 alone. I?€?ve had spoken to 4 different customer service agents. The whole process appears to be fraudulent and in breach of UK distance selling regulations.",1,12/08/2023

"It's an addiction ???? it's pulled me in, getting frequent bags of goodies delivered, it's like heaven for crafter's. Clothes I tend to avoid but toys, craft items and stationery etc are perfection. Never had a late delivery either. Only thing I will say as a negative is the constant popups and apparent need to ""check out now, it's almost gone"" emails and promotions that make you think you're getting your money back, spend so much and get ??50 rebate ???? you spend it, get the ""??50"" as separate vouchers where you have a minimum spend each time and only have 2 days to use them, i.e. you could get ??10 off ??30 spend or ??15 off ??60 spend, not exactly a rebate, so to get your ??50 worth you're basically spending around ??150-200 over 2 days ????",5,12/08/2023
"I've seen some dreadful reviews for Temu but my experience has been only positive so far. The only thing I haven't done yet is order clothing as I can't see reviews on whether sizes are true to Uk and how small to large aligns with Uk 12-14. I find measuring with a tape measure quite unreliable so a Uk sizing chart giving an indication would be useful, but cheap items for round the house have been excellent and I bought cushion covers that are honestly habitat quality at Lidl prices... very happy!!",5,12/08/2023
Absolutely love ???? this company. Yes it?€?s from China however they have the best if not the most finest customer service experience by far. 98/100 products are exactly as described and expected.

"I bought some clothes& other bits & bobs on Temu. I was attracted by the lovely bright colours in the pictures. They arrived quickly enough, but am massively disappointed in the clothes.

"I was hesitant to use Temu as reviewers are either really good or really bad but a friend said she has had no issues so I thought I?€?d try a small order. I was really pleased with what I got so much so that I?€?ve since ordered 5 more times. I had one thing I needed a refund on but had no problems and money was back in my bank in 2 days. Will definitely be using again as there is such a range of good value stuff, especially kid?€?s clothes.",5,12/08/2023
"To be honest I was a little surprised when I got my order from Temu.  The items received were better quality than I was expecting, given the low price they were charging.  Also,  shipping to Ireland was free and so to are the returns, which is a real bonus. You just print off the label they generate for you and tape it onto you package and drop it off at your selected post office.   I bought four sets of various swimwear for upcoming holidays and they were the type of quality I would expect from most high street shops, proper swimsuit type material, well stitched with not cheap looking.  The fit was normal for a UK 8 but most of all, the colours were really vibrant, the pictures on the website didn?€?t do them justice.  I had to return one item though because it was a little too short and revealing, if I had a better set of thighs and a perkier bottom, I would have kept it as it was a beautiful shade of royal blue and black but as the returns process was really simple and free I just decided to return it, even though it didn?€?t cost that much to begin with.",5,12/08/2023

"I made a purchase 2 weeks ago with Temu without signing up for an account with them. The item arrived today DAMAGED, so I contacted customer services online (essentially a bot) - in order to do this I had to make an account with them, so I did. I requested to speak to a real person, and they 're-directed' me to someone else, who I suspect is also a robot. Essentially they said I could not get refunded because the ORDER number was not associated to my ACCOUNT, even though I explained I didn't have an account with them when placing the order. They didn't care and essentially lied, saying that the order number may be associated with a different account, even I TOLD THEM multiple times I did not have an account with this order. Bottom line, AVOID AVOID AVOID this company and NEVER buy anything from them if you don't have an account with them beforehand. They don't care if your goods arrive damaged, and it's basically IMPOSSIBLE to speak to a real person if you ever have any problems with anything. Bunch of thieving crooks!!",1,13/08/2023

Temu staff clearly don?€?t understand English beyond their automated script. Staff are overly ignorant and some are deceitful and verbally abusive towards female customers treating them very poorly. I have asked to return goods over 160 times now to constantly be told no refund without return but they will not accept their goods back. They are worse shopping app I?€?ve ever seen and managers are just ignorant as phone and web staff.

I ordered a package from Temu online?? they're normally reliable but this time I didn't get the package. So I contacted Temu and they told me the package was delivered. I asked for a refund or a redelivery of the package. They told me to contact the people who delivered it Straighship and ask about the package but they say it was delivered and when I track it says it was delivered. I still don't have my package nor my refund. This is the package info BG-24011258M2Z8TVX2-02 of order PO-037-06809744865913683. This has been going on for about 7 days.?? I was told they opened a ticket for me(Temu). No answer. Now they say my ticket was closed without solution. What can I do? It was a $168 order. Have been using team for about 1 year. I have had issues with their deliveries from Straightship and requested that they stop using this courier for my orders and they continue using it. I have lost over $1000 in undelivered items. They used to be helpful and refund when I did not receive something and now they don't. They either only want to offer a $20 coupon or they say they can't do anything to help me. Now again they use the wrong courier and I don't get my delivery. The photo the courier provided was not proof of delivery. There is no package in the photo. It is a blurry photo of the wall outside of my building. They did not show the package was delivered and they did not buzz or call me. Just marked as delivered. To where? The street? And now TEMU won't help or take responsibility. They are responsible for making sure I receive my order aren't they? I can't take talking to their customer service anymore and getting the same automated messages with no solution.,1,14/08/2023
"I love Temu, and so does my hubby! We're addicted. Many friends have scolded us for purchasing from Temu, so I did a lot of searching on the web. We have never experienced the problems others have. We always get the orders on time, or earlier! Temu sends us emails to let us know the shipping progress of our orders. If we need to return something, again we get emails to tell us where our package is in the process of getting the refund. And we have always gotten the refund or store credit in a timely fashion! They have delivery guarantees and they stand behind them: $5.00 Credit for delay15-day no update refundRefund if item damaged30-day no delivery refundIf an item goes cheaper while we are waiting for our order to arrive, they'll automatically reduce it for us. But it never hurts to check yourself and tell them if it went cheaper to get the reduction! Numerous times the sizes of clothes are off or sewed so that it doesn't fit. But, I don't complain (though I'm sad). Instead, I reorder a different size or something else with the store credit I opt for when returning it. I love that there is free shipping when ordering over a specific low amount, and there's free shipping plus a printable label for returning. Sometimes the minimum amount for free shipping is $10. Sometimes it's $15. I'm not sure why. But there is always some little gadget, etc, that I could use that will bring it to the  minimum. They also tell you the size of the package you will be getting. I agree with the customer who purchased jewelry beads. Sometimes they aren't the best quality but hey, they were quite cheap. If the quality is unusably poor, I take a photo and send a request for a refund. Most of the time they tell me to keep the beads and give me store credit. For some items, I compare them with Amazon and Walmart. The advertising photos and descriptions are the same but so much cheaper on Temu. And when it comes, it looks like the advertised photos. I have experienced no adversity for purchasing these items from Temu instead of Amazozn, etc. Because of our income, we can afford things if they are on Temu. We don't play the fish game or other games that are similar on Temu, as they appear to be rabbit's hole. In a nut shell, I don't listen to my friends and still like and shop Temu!",5,14/08/2023
They use canned responses to direct questions regarding shipments and lack of transparency.  Temu believes that their responsibility to the customer  ends as soon as your order leaves China. They will assure  you anything  to make you go away and wait . Nothing but hassle and headaches  dealing with these people. I have had to dispute things with my Credit card company and bank to get refunds. Their business model is about them and not you .

"Excellent service, very responsible with  customers Payments and returns.Good flexibility with returns.I'm very happy with the good services, and different  kinds of products.Thank you,",5,14/08/2023
So far I have been very pleased with all of my purchases and the delivery time.  Much better than other online retailers with similar items.,5,14/08/2023
Temu is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB). The products come in damaged or certain things are stated that they're real yeah real fake! The material of the clothing is disgusting. Not to mention so is the customer service! They send you broken things and expect you to pay to package them and send them back!,1,14/08/2023
"I love Temu! I am a frequent customer and have spent a lot of money on this site. I always have gotten the correct items and they are so unique, fit well and i almost always get alot of compliments on the clothes i get from there.Getting the correct sizes get easier with experience. You have to read the description and be able to measure where it tells you to measure for a correct fit. Not everything I order has been perfect. But sending back stuff is really easy and free. I have gotten my money back quickly and without a lot of hassle.I have not been very successful with buying bras on the site. I?€?m a big chested girl and the fit have just not been comfortable or as supportive as I need. So I don?€?t even try anymore.So far my account has never been stolen or used fraudulently. Although a customer service number that you can call would be great!I have great fun buying, waiting, reviewing and the anticipation of seeing those orange taped up packages sitting on my porch waiting for me.It?€?s almost an addiction so I think I might need a support group in the future!????",5,14/08/2023
"I returned a package for refund, only to be told they can't find it in its package, so I didn't get my refund.Thank you for your reply, I have given chances to resolve this several times via chat and all. But the team came back with the same conclusion, saying I won?€?t get the refund as they couldn?€?t find the product in the package.If you had resolved it before now, this comment will not be necessary.",1,14/08/2023
There are some cool hidden gems in Temu that I have ordered that are actually helpful around the house (like a toothpaste squeezer). Quality of the products is a mixed bag since there some things that are great but others that are made from very cheap material and might not last that long. I do wish that some of the items I ordered came in a box (every time it's in a large bag without any protection) instead since they can bend and break easily.,4,14/08/2023
"I have never been a great shopper until I discovered Temu.com and I hadn't bought new clothes for several years until now. The prices are so affordable and the quality very good. I went on to buy other goods I needed but simply couldn't afford until Temu and I'm delighted with all my purchases but one; even then, I was refunded my money within seconds! I have become quite the shopper indeed now with the amount of contents to purchase and their prices. The customer service is first rate and I can't fault this business. Thank you Temu!",5,14/08/2023

"Voucher - warning. I have ordered nearly 100 items off them. Every so often they give you a voucher. ( loyalty).I bought an item using the voucher ( extra ??15.00 discount ). The item went faulty in only a month. So I sent it back for either a replacement under warranty or credit/refund. Be warned no option for a replacement only refund. But they will not refund ??15 voucher or re-instate it ( stole the voucher off me - which I got because of all your purchases ).I have closed my account now - and won't deal with them again.Update to Temu replySpoke with their support on three different occasions. Useless - all three in the end offered 20% discount. So I would have to spend ??80.00 more at 20% discount, to just get the ??15.00 worth of voucher back they stole.",1,14/08/2023

"I've been buying from Temu for 9 months now and have had as many orders delivered. I have never had a problem with them, some things I have received have not been the size I expected, but for the price I paid for these things I didn't return them, I just passed them on. I'm already waiting for my next delivery",5,14/08/2023
"The things they sell are rubbish. There's a minimum spend to get free delivery so you buy a few items to get free deliver. But the items you get are mainly cheap, you may get one item that's really good but if the rest of the order is cheap rubbish you paid all that money for one decent item which you could of bought elsewhere cheaper in the first place. The reviews on there website is for the seller for all the items they sell not the one you are buying. Cheap rubbish at a price that's expensive because the one item you get is OK but you've wasted your money on the other things that are either useless or not worth the money. Used Temu about 3 times and that was my experience on all three. Wouldn't use them again I'll go elsewhere and it the long run get better value for my money.",1,14/08/2023
"Ordered my first delivery from Temu with a variety of products not knowing what to expect for the prices Six shadow box picture frames of different sizes and colours all arrived in excellent condition and decent quality ???Tumbled blue and white ceramic craft pieces x2 packs arrived and exactly what was pictured and described ???925 silver pendant claw setting mount, arrived in good time and I have tested the purity and quality of the wire and have nothing to say negative, it was about a third less expensive than I have bought elsewhere and the finish is perfect so I will be buying these again ???Electric clothes lint Remover was something I saw and actually need , no complaints, it works as described, it was cheap and will function Overall with free delivery all items were delivered In one package after 10 days ( standard from China) and from this first order I can only speak how I find and personally I will be happy to recommend and will be purchasing again from Temu in the future",5,14/08/2023
"Another addictive customer here, I can not stop ordering from this company and now my husband is addicted too and that says a lot. They have a lot of unique items at a great value.",5,14/08/2023
Excellent customer service. Unfortunately the item I ordered had a faulty zip but Temu immediately refunded my money and told me to keep the item,5,14/08/2023
Love this site everything you can think of even things you wouldn't think even existed on this site at half or quarter of the price of amazon ebay ect. Exellent 5* from me,5,15/08/2023
"I love Temu, I have spent hundreds and have found some fabulous items, lots of kitchen things and dolls clothes. Clothes for myself and lots of items too many to mention. Very satisfied and free shipping is marvellous",5,15/08/2023
"I am addicted to Temu, so surprised that anything I search for they have, there are some cheap tacky items, but also some cheap awesome products too, just check details and photos before ordering. I order from them at least 4 times a month, I can treat myself whenever I feel like it as it's so affordable and supplies for my crafting hobby are a third the price I was paying on amazon for exactly the same product. Tracking is awesome, you're kept informed all the way through the shipping process, well done Temu",5,15/08/2023
"I have had items from this company, and majority okay, and some not. But my real issue is they don't price match another company. I bought an item from Temu at ??55 which was a little high I thought. So since purchased it, it arrived, and looked on another site, Ali Express, found the item there for ??38 so told Temu this and screen shot it, and sent in email to Temu customer service. So had countless useless emails from Temu basically saying they will not price match another company, only there own. But most businesses in the UK will price match the difference. As there a difference of ??17 Temu will not match it and refund me the difference. I have tussled with customer service and they will not honour a loyal customer. I just been told no all the time, and I even said if you not matching another competitor at least a ??5 credit voucher to use with Temu but they still won't even do that. When I put orders in, often good amount, so really quite hurt by the way I being treated by them. This review is a reflect on the customer care, and any price match. The site itself has some lovely items and normally the delivery is good and quick. But I suffer severe depression, my health not good, and fighting with these people over a thing to them would be nothing to honour even a ??5   credit voucher, but they still refuse. I really distressed over there non care for customers, and like I said it the customers that keep a business in business! Not happy with them at all. Will vary my options for other competitors in future. WELL GOT REPLY AS YOU SEE FROM TEMU, AND STILL WON'T DO ANYTHING AND STILL NOT DO ANYTHING AS A GOODWILL GESTURE EITHER! SO LIKE I SAID CUSTOMER CARE IS TOTALLY RUBBISH, AS THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT REPEAT CUSTOMERS.",1,15/08/2023
"I have ordered a few times from Temu now and over all am very happy with my purchases. I have had a couple of faulty items which have been refunded without issue. The quality on the majority of what i have purchased has been pleasantly surprising. Clothes have been of good quality material especially given they?€?ve been so cheap. The woolly socks i got were the best ive found by far. I brought kitchen equipment from cookie cutters, sieve and cutting boards all great quality but make sure to check measurements as the cookie cutters were alot smaller than i wanted but the measurements were correct i just forgot to check them so thats on me. The one negative is the games they advertise, they are ridiculous as you will practically never get the free items they offer because each play takes less and less off your amount. It encourages you to send links to earn more but if you dont have loads of contacts who will want these links then dont expect to get the free items. But what can you expect for free. Overall im happy with my experiences with Temu and will continue shopping with them",5,15/08/2023

"I love Temu.  They have very good return/refund policy, unlike Aliexpress.  You don't have to deal with the Sellers, and shipping is always free.  Just shop responsibly to avoid returns and refund, because you are supporting cheap labors.",5,15/08/2023
"90 day Free Return and 30 day price adjustment? Best online retailer! And yes, I have tried those 2 things many times, never had a problem! I wouldn't even expect terms this favourable for me as a customer! Simply, thank you!I bought many excellent quality products at funny prices. Temu is by far my favourite ever online retailer! Better than eBay, Amazon, Wish, and don't even get me started on AliExpress!Only issues I have with Temu are:1) Minimum ??10 orders. Why not make me pay for delivery or only deliver to shop, not home, if order is under ??10? Also, AliExpress have ??8 minimum orders, so they are better in this aspect, I admit.2) Doesn't accept USD $ in the UK for some reason, unlike AliExpress3) Don't have as wide of a portfolio of products as AliExpress. Temu literally just doesn't sell everything. I wish I could buy anything price-matched that is on AliExpress, but on Temu.",5,15/08/2023
"I am trying to return an item worth about $70.  I got a refund which Temu can take back in 14 days if I don't ship.  But I cannot get a shipping label to send it back.  They did send a confirmatory email with a link that supposedly takes me to the shipping label, but there is no shipping label there.  In fact, with only bots in customer service I go around in an infinite loop without getting a real person to help.A bot must have written Temu's response because the link they provided just takes me back to the ""customer support"" with more bots taking me on more infinite loops.  I just want the shipping label to send this item back.",1,15/08/2023
Decent quality products with lowest prices ever. Free delivery and return. Fast shipping. Best online marketplace.,5,15/08/2023
Package showed delivered but it never arrived. Shipping is with a fake delivery company.The delivery company called YTO doesn?€?t have support service. I was at home when they marked my items as delivered. And they never arrived. Tried complaining and requesting for a refund with no luck. Temu just points out that the fake company is the responsible for the delivery. A pure SCAM! The options for refund only appear one month after the order has been ?€?delivered?€? and they policy is only refunds before 30 days after delivery date. No one replies in customer service chats.Don?€?t buy!,1,15/08/2023

"I ordered a dog jacket from Temu. Our dog has a 23-inch chest, which according to the size chart was a 4XL! I thought 4XL sounds large, but who am I to question their website?This is my second attempt to order from a China sourced company, the first was from another company called Doggy Kingdom.The jacket shipped arrived in a timely manner given the distance it traveled. The jacket is perfect, nicely made. However the size is 28-inches at the chest.Temu issued back an immediate refund to my PayPal account and said I didn't need to return the jacket. I read some awful reviews of Temu. I had a great experience, they offer lots of merchandise and unreal prices. The shipping and tracking were great, the refund process was easy. My mother was a seamstress, they get paid by the piece. For something that costs a hundred dollars they get paid cents. Not fair! You bet, but how do you know? Temu seems to be eliminating the middleman, this really drops the cost. I can only hope they pay there production workers well. In the US, we have child labor laws, we just don't enforce them. There are immigrant children working swing shift factory jobs operating heaving, dangerous machinery in all 50 states. This is not a red state blue state thing.Long story short, I would buy from Temu again. It seems there is something getting lost in translation when it comes to sizing.

I have a complaint regarding delivery if a package today.The delivery person who delivered my package today buzzed my apartment #301 but instead of coming up to my door he left it in the lobby of my apartment building where anyone can steal it.My apartment # is always noted in my address delivery so there is no excuse  as to why he couldn't have come up to my door.This is the second time this has happened,5,17/08/2023
Temu are scammers and go by bait and switch mono. It's a worst version of Amazon. They send you a bunch of promotions and when you think you get free staff or a promotion they totally bait and switch on you and give you tons of other conditions to get a promotion. But on reality it's not achievable,1,17/08/2023
"I can?€?t personally find fault with Temu. Their price adjustment scheme is great and if you have an issue with a product, it is refunded immediately. I?€?ve spent a lot of money with Temu and although I?€?ve had the odd faulty product, I really can?€?t complain. Their refund policy and procedure is great.",5,17/08/2023
Avoid them at all cost their customer service agents all have fake names barely speak / Write English when item arrives in empty box they claim it was sent so it?€?s ok. They stole my ??21 not a big money but it?€?s principal!,1,17/08/2023
Absolutely fabulous! Ordered a few iPhone cases and some razors for my shaver only 7 days ago! Arrived today. All brilliant quality and superb updates on its journey from China. Beyond any expectations I had. Will definitely use again. ????,5,17/08/2023
Everyone that have temu help me win a free gift please,5,17/08/2023
"I have NOTHING negative to say about my experience. All the items I bought were exactly what I expected from the description, I was constantly updated about the status of my order and if I had bought what I did from a retail outlet, I would have paid a great deal more.",5,17/08/2023
I was charged 5 times by Temu for products that I never purchased or authorized to pay. It looks like the site is fraudulently creating transactions and stealing or someone is using the platform for the same. Be careful..,1,17/08/2023
absolutely disgusting customer service unsecure parcel delivery when they arrive rather it's been opened and damaged or item's missing...i've just received a parcel fully opened and when checked multiple items missing reported to temu and they said all items were packed when it left there warehouse...the couriers they use are evri who use to be hermes most of the times parcels are just left on the doorstep they just knock and go...so temu won't issue me a refund as the warehouse staff packed the order so if anything goes missing in transit there not interested shocking way to do business...wont be using temu again but to be honest most of the items are not good...,1,17/08/2023
Really disappointed 3 items were missing from my parcel totalling around ??17 to ??18 ... temu have refused a refund twice as they say its been checked by their warehouse and checked and apparently arrived in good condition  I feel totally ripped off,1,17/08/2023
"Had quite a few goods off Temu, some good some bad, but you do pays your money and takes your choice.I?€?m impressed the way they give you refunds if the items drop in price, and these have been instant for me.There are metal signs that down the boot fairs there around ??5-6 each, I got 5 for less than ??3 for all of them. A 0.79p iPhone holder, yes it wasn?€?t the best of quality but it did do what I wanted it to do without any fuss, and after all what do you expect for that price.I?€?m now looking into a car speaker/amp upgrade, upper end of the quality spectrum and what I?€?m seeing is fairly good systems.And all this delivered free via plane from whence they come followed by EVRI and all for a minimum spend of ??10, yes items in Jiffy bags sometimes could do with something stronger or being in a box ????, but overall not too disappointed.",4,17/08/2023
"I was dubious at first, too good to be true and all. But I have received my delivery and it is spot on! 1 item was missing and after raising it on the app, I was refunded in seconds to my Temu balance. Of course some items may be cheaply made so it can be hit and miss, but you get what you pay for and 99% of my stuff is great quality. The return and refund policy is fair and I have a lot of fun with the Fishland game. Make sure to invite people for extra fish food!",5,17/08/2023
"Shipping is pretty quick, I ordered one thing that turned out weird (the picture did not look the actual thing), and temu refunded it immediately. I have used them for many items now. Pop-up Christmas cards, eyeshadow, Christmas sweaters, shoes...Always been happy",4,17/08/2023
"Ordered a few time. Most things are OK, if you have issues they do refund and you can return things free. I do recommend. Took a risk in curtains and bedding and was actually impressed with how nice they look. I've only had a caulker of things I wasn't happy with but I did take a risk in ordering them top. Prices are great",5,17/08/2023
Saved a ton of money shopping on Temu this Christmas and now lost it all paying to exterminate the roaches that came in the packages. Disgusting! We?€?ve lived in this house for 8 years and get regular indoor and outdoor pest control. The only thing we did different was start ordering from Temu and I?€?ve seen other posts that others have had the same issue.,2,17/08/2023
Was a bit cautious at first after losing my faith in Wish. Placed a small order (??15) and got 5 items at great prices plus a free gift! Order was easy. I was kept updated at every step of my order. It took 6 days to arrive. I was very pleased with every single item. I ordered a cardigan. Was exactly as picture and quality and sizing spot on. Another order was a pack of gorgeous sunglasses. 5 pairs in every colour  for ??2. I'm very happy and can't wait to order again.,5,17/08/2023

AWFUL company. I ordered some items on the 3rd December 2023. The items were due for delivery (at the latest) 22nd December 2023. On 22nd December 2023 I received a ??5 credit because the items were LATE!On 3rd January 2024 I receive a notice to say the items were delivered on the 19th December 2023 - which makes NO SENSE.I complained. No joy. I went to paypal - paypal sided with TEMU because TEMU can prove they posted the items but have NO PHOTO to prove delivery (via EVRI).I'm now left with no money (??150) and no items!Small Claims court here I come. DO NOT SHOP HERE - They have NO LOGIC when it comes to resolving complaints.,1,18/08/2023
"After reading a lot of reviews I was unsure about this company so I thought I would do a small shop to test it for myself.The ordering process was very easy with a varied selection of items and very good prices, I knew what I was looking for and found my choice for car accessories very easily, the prices are excellent, so I placed my order and waited for my order to arrive.I was very pleasantly surprised, the tracking was very good keeping me informed of the parcels journey and in a matter of mere days my items had arrived.They were all good quality and instead of paying pounds I had saved money on my entire order.I have placed several further orders and they have all been as successful as the first.Perhaps people that are pleased with this company do not tend to leave reviews expressing their experiences, and people that are not tend to voice their concerns more freely.I am definitely glad that I placed the first order and will use this company again.",5,18/08/2023
"I purchased a kitchen strip light and was a little apprehensive at first due to the price. However it?€?s amazing, works really well and looks great. I will be buying from you again.",5,18/08/2023
"This is regarding the clothing on TEMU. It IS too good to be true. What you see in the pictures is nothing like what you receive. Despite measuring, sizes are incorrect - to the point that you'd have to have non - human proportions for some of the items (one dress in particular had a slit going so high that it would only be appropriate for someone with a deformed, short torso, quality is incredibly poor and the items barely resemble the pictures provided - even in colour!! I'm so disappointed having (stupidly) spent over $200 I am throwing most items straight in the bin. It would even be insulting to put them in a charity bin as they are only fit for landfill",1,18/08/2023
Ordered a massage gun. Arrived in approx. 10 days. Good price decent quality. Works well no complaints,5,18/08/2023
"The absolute pile of trash website with awful customer service. I ordered 11 items and only 3 arrived. The courier website delivery proof picture showed a tiny parcel that was damaged. Sent these to Temu and a refund was denied because the ""factory said they sent the package""...of course they did! They magically squeezed into a tiny package.Have spent hours on their customer service app trying to get my money back. I was told my refund was being processed for the missing items only to be told 20 minutes later that I had cancelled the refund!! Like that's true!This is the worst scamming website out there. Makes itself come across as honest but it is operating using child labour and ughiyars as slave  labour in camps then their customer service agents try to make out they're in the USA!!Refund my money!!!Update: I contacted the support team as stated below to get my refund and this is the response I got:I'm sincerely sorry that this resolution is not satisfying for you. However, since our warehouse has confirmed that your package was shipped, I am unable to help you with this request.Still not had a refund. Absolute scammers!!",1,18/08/2023
"Recently made a series of consecutive purchases from this company and was very pleased with the prices and the good quality of the products. Everything was going well until the last two orders were not delivered, but I received a confirmation on the website stating that the packages were indeed delivered. I contacted the company Straightship, responsible for the deliveries, and they sent me fake photos of Amazon packages in which the clothes I purchased would not fit. I immediately informed Temu, which refunded me for the first package in credits for future purchases. They have not yet refunded me for the second package. What concerns me greatly is the fact that I informed Temu about the fraud involving fake photos and false deliveries by Straightship, and Temu did absolutely nothing. They do not explain what is happening and only offer credit for new purchases.I am waiting for two more packages, and I am convinced that I will not receive them I am very worried.  will continue posting here all the information about these packages that were not delivered and the other two that I am waiting for, whether they are delivered or not.//// I would like to update my previous comments regarding Temu. I've received a message confirming a refund for items that weren't delivered. They have also offered help with any future issues. Honestly, I believe Temu has not yet realized the poor quality of the delivery service here in Canada, but I must acknowledge that they have been responsive to my complaint and are working to resolve the issue. I really hope to continue buying clothes from them, as the price, quality, and service are excellent. However, it's crucial that the goods are actually delivered, or else it's pointless.",4,18/08/2023
"I was have been for months putting of ordering as wasn't sure and instead of looking for all the positive reviews looked for the negative. Choosing my products people can leave reviews that helped greatly with my options. People will even take photos and videos. I ordered and the whole time you could track your order and the communication was great for them. I highly recommend subscription to WhatsApp/text message option as they send lots of money of and voucher options. Items arrived on dates specified however you do get ??5 credit if it runs late. Nothing was broken and was wrapped well. I ordered a mix of items from DIY to clothing.  For the price I paid I would not complain at all , the jumper and hoodie were lovely thick material and the long sleeved top was cotton. The flask set with 3 cups I only paid ??3.50 and they were far better than the one I bought for  ??15 with a well known supermarket. The biggest gamble as most expensive was the self stick wallpaper however I'm super impressed and I actually ended up with a spare roll, which I'm going to use in the downstairs loo.Like with every company, supermarket, shop items will be different some better than other. However I'm already starting my second order.",5,18/08/2023
Absolutely LOVE Temu. I discovered it about March 2023 time. Ive since placed 88 orders (sometimes i was ordering every day amd even twice a day. I was hooked lol) and spent a small fortune. Ive taken part in the fishland game AND did manage to get the free gifts. A rechargeable fishing fan for the other half and a veg slicer/chopper for me. Nice freebies to get. I just love it. I will admit i do find myself scrolling through just browsing and then adding random items just because they are so cheap it would be daft not to. Lol. Any broken/faulty items they immediately give you a refund. You just send a pic in. Usually a code/voucher for money off orders. Some are great e.g. ??15 off ??40. Some are not so great ??1 off ??39. Im really frustrated at the moment though as i now cant find the customer service 'contact us' dept. Ive been looking the last couple of days. Hoping to find it so i can then place another order. Have a look on there. Ignore those that say they scam you. Its not true. Just pay with paypal and your purchase is protected. Happy shopping :-),5,18/08/2023
"I decided to try Temu as I had heard good things about them from my friends. Worst decision ever... I ended up losing a lot of money instead (almost 1000 DKK - approx. 145 USD). I made a big order - why not when things are that cheap, you know? That order, however, was then made into two packages. Fair enough I thought. One day I got a message saying that the first package was delivered. No delivery picture was attached and I had been home all day, so I knew for sure they hadn't come by my house. I looked everywhere and did not find the package. I contacted Temu and got a refund of like 20 bucks, which was great. Then a couple of days later, the second package arrived. The package looked a bit torn, but nothing big. When I opened the package I noticed that there were only a few things from my order in the package. I then contacted Temu again thinking they could look into it and tell me whether those items might have been in the first package. The response I got was that they were sure the items had left their warehouse (they didn't tell me which package they were in) and that the only compensation I could get was a 20% discount for their website. I then asked for a refund as 20% discount doesn't make up for my lost money. My request was denied... Three times! Worst customer service I've ever experienced and overall just very disappointing. I do not want to spend any more of my money on Temu when I risk paying for items I never received and my friends have also stopped shopping here as they have now also had a few complaints about their own experiences with Temu. My advice is to stay away unless you want to lose money.",1,18/08/2023
"Items arrived in good time, small table had suffered a broken leg in transit, hardly surprising as had been wrapped in foam sheet and sent bagged, not even in a box.  Have looked into a refund for this and I have to return it before this can be processed, what a joke. Canvas prints which were listed appearing to be framed have been sent rolled and are not good colour/print quality.  Overall a bad experience, glad I didn?€?t pay full price for any of it and won?€?t be ordering anything else!",1,18/08/2023
"Very happy with the service and products! Temu kept me updated every step of the way until my items was delivered. Excited for my next purchase. And to add, I was very skeptical with the reviews but Temu really surprised me!",5,18/08/2023
The bad thing is that i bought some stuff and there preparing to ship but then half of my stuff got sold out! But temu is pretty good and cheap,4,18/08/2023
"I was initially cautious, but have found this company an absolute joy to deal with. I do use Paypal for my purchases for a bit of added security, but I have found their service outstanding.Delivery is quick and any errors or refunds are dealt with literally in minutes!",5,18/08/2023
"I placed 2 orders with Temu in the past couple of months.  Both arrived quickly with all items in good shape.  All items were as expected and my expectation was not high.  I not running a business with these items , and they performed fine for my needs. First order was for nightlights similar to Wyze's.  Very satisfied. The other was a paper cutter (single sheet)  Works fine, precision not great but good enough for my needs.  I think the more complex an item is with moving parts, etc., the probability that it will not work as well as a known brand.  You pay for what you get",4,18/08/2023
"I feel very much scammed! I bought items for almost 1556 kroner. 90% of the products that I received were damaged, low-quality and faded. Contacted the temu customer services several times but they were rude and kept on asking for photos. The want the labels to be printed and items dropped off to far off delivery points. A person who has no car and lives in a small town cannot afford to go back and forth to the delivery points to return packages, in this bad Swedish winters. Small sized, extremely low quality products that look absolutely hideous when they arrive and are way too overpriced. Temu wants us to pay for all the products. I would not recommend anyone to shop from here. Just avoid being scammed!",1,18/08/2023
There are some amazing bargains but there is also some absolute rubbish.The games Fishland and Farmland are complete cons as the nearer you get to the end goal the more you need to get as the percentage per fish gets less and less so impossible to win. Lots of the orders come with dented boxes or damaged packaging. On the bright side if an item is broken or does not fit you get an immediate refund which in this day and age is unbelievable. If you can manage to just buy what you want and not get side tracked into buying lots of items that are just so cheap you can and will bag some bargains.,3,18/08/2023

"I've had several orders from Temu, I have had no problems at all with this company. What's not to love? The way it's laid out is something I really like, makes it more interesting, also the way the pricing works, love the price adjustment button that makes sure you are getting the best price available. Deliveries have been quick and reliable.",5,18/08/2023
Absolutely super fantastic????????cheap & very fast delivery????????& they sell almost everything????????super fantastic indeed????????????????,5,18/08/2023
My experience with Temu is brilliant. I can not understand some of the negative reviews written here.  I guest you've all been extremely unlucky. Some of the quality of clothing is not what I like (given the price is to be expected)but I've always been able to return the items and on occasions have kept items and had credit for them. Tracking is excellent I always know when parcels are out for delivery. Hope you all get better experiences in future.,5,19/08/2023
"I've been using Temu for a couple of years now and not had any issues using the platform.I recently had a parcel misplaced by EVRI who appears to be their default delivery courier for my area. The terms state you can have a refund after 30 days but I was offered one after the parcel having no movement for three days. Which is much quicker than most companies will offer a refund.The customer service was prompt and their grammatical use of English was probably better than mine.Some of the items, if not most are mass dropship things. But... So is Amazon and they charge 3-4 times more.I haven't ever bought any clothes off Temu however so I can't comment on clothing.Their marketing attempts in app are also a bit aggressive and disabling them is hidden in the preferences tab.TLDR: Worth a try in my opinion.",5,19/08/2023
Just received my order from this company.i have posted a previous review regarding this company and it was positive.i can go one further your products for the price are absolutely amazing you came up trumps again well done you deserve to prosper,5,19/08/2023
I cannot say enough good things about this platform. After using wish which was very disappointing because the scammers and  fraudsters are the employees and employers as the same with AliExpress who are rude and nasty I have found non of that with temu and have been a happy customer for 3 months. The quality of their items is extremely high especially the clothing which I cannot fault They are very easy to contact on chat they respond immediately and they are super nice and  resolve issues quickly . The goods take about 10-14 days to arrive and shipping and returns is Free. In my opinion wish and AliExpress will fade out because they  will loose customers . I highly recommend temu and I really enjoy shopping with them because they make it enjoyable because their customer service is so very good .,5,19/08/2023
"Best avoided.  I bought 21 items in 2 orders.  The items arrived quickly and nothing was missing but the vast majority of the items are really poor quality and do not match up to the claims or pictures on the Temu site. One item (a headlight guard for a BMW motorcycle) was so clearly not fit for purpose that I returned it.  Whilst Temu claim free shipping and free returns the return will credit me with ??8.64 instead of the ??14.98 paid!? ""Currency exchange and handling costs.""  I won't be buying anything else in spite of the lure of low prices.",1,19/08/2023

"We never received our item. We raised a query with Temu and the delivery company and then the status changed to delivered but it never arrived.

Lesson learned.",1,19/08/2023
"I'm re-updating my review as after long follow up of 1 week with delivery partner and Temu , finally i received my refund today for the order delivered to wrong location.Happy to increase my rating here for the service but assuming this experience, Temu should enhance their handling processes  for such cases in more feasible manner to provide better experience to customer.Thanks again for your help with refund.",4,19/08/2023

"I ordered replacement watch straps for my Xiaomi 5 fitness tracker. The push-button fastening was broken on both and the packaging was torn.

There have been lot of improvements with temu. I like that the order can be changed after it has been placed ( within a time frame).Delivery time has become faster and the tracking was spot on. In fact a day early.I find the site very confusing still. There is so much. I found it easier just to put stuff in my basket. It was annoying to be constantly reminded that I had stuff in my basket while I was still shopping. I find with clothing the first picture shown is the original design.  That picture needs to be ignored and others looked at. I was sadly disappointed with my free gift which was not like the picture and too small. Because its a free gift I can hardly return it for a bigger size. I can't even give it away. Overall a better shopping experience,4,20/08/2023
"I was so put off by these online reviews but though I'd give it a go.

Loved the products I ordered and with the clothes I bought they were true to their size described.  Could not fault this company and I will be ordering more from them in the future.",5,20/08/2023
"Very good experience with them. I ordered three packages and will order more. I got refund also.With clothes the size didn't find, so I had to return them, but for the rest basically they match the price. The quality is from so-so to good, depending on item.",5,20/08/2023
Ordered 4 small items as a test of the site since prices hinted that it might be a scam. Received all four items by promised date. Am very happy with my experience to date. Ordered two much larger (more expensive) items since my initial experience and will follow up with a review when they arrive.,5,20/08/2023
I have been pleased with almost everything I've ordered from TEMU.  It seems a lot of the negative reviews come from customers outside the USA.  I have attempted to return a couple of items but got refunds without having to return the items.  I also got one  $5.00 credit for a late arrival.  I've heard bad things about Temu but I will continue to shop unless a problem occurs.  I have 3 orders I'm waiting on as of now.  Keep up the good work.,5,20/08/2023
I buy a lot of things from Temu and I can?€?t praise them high enough for their prompt customer service. Some of the goods are cheap but most are excellent quality. The clothing and shoes are definitely value for money. Any problems are dealt with immediately and I would give more than 5 stars if I could. Delivery is always on time. Keep up the good work Temu.,5,20/08/2023

"Fraud website????????????.First they sent me used winter boots, when I contacted them they took several hours to understand my concerns and told me relevant team will contact me which never happened.I have contacted them back they again took several hours to understand my concerns when I asked for collection their item however they refused for collection as they don?€?t have such system.I then returned the item with 2 other items which received and refunded, after few days I checked my account I don?€?t know  what happened they have collected the refunded amount from my account without informing me.When I raised question regarding this again they took several hours and provided false information, they agents are useless any time  contacted they wasted my time reply my 1 single message.I consider they are fraud and scammer I m going to raise this to citizen advise bureau and will take appropriate action against them.PLEASE DONT SHOP AND TRUST THEM.",1,21/08/2023

"I mistakenly forgot to remove my SD card from dashboard camera I returned. I have contacted this people for the past 5 months to send my SD card back to me that contains sensitive and personal documents and data. They said they found my item and  I should send a DHL return label, I bought one and sent and waited. Now after 5 months of emails now they said they couldn?€?t find my SD card anymore? What?! The customer service agent named Anja Zhang keeps sending me same copy and pasted emails over and over again making fun of me I?€?m sure. Never ever buying from this company ever again, can?€?t trust them! Their customer service is terrible",1,21/08/2023
Shipping is horrible. Prices are the same as amazon. I'm sticking with amazon. No clue where my items are the shipping doesn't update anything and no other shipping places will recognize the track number.,2,21/08/2023
I was afraid to use Temu at first because the prices on some things are so low it seemed like a scam but I have oredered from them several times with no problem. They make returns free and easy,5,21/08/2023
After using them for a year or so finally I decided that I will look for another provider if any. Their packaging is so lousy that the last 3 orders were damaged. Ordered wallpapers and they came in a plastic bag...damaged to death! Also the quality of products are more and more faulty. Cheap chinese crap!Update: as you all can see the best Temu can do is to provide a copy paste response...They arw so up with themselves that ohh we refund you ohe we want to help. I repeat this was the third order in a row which went tits up! I would love to upload picfures as of how products arrived lately!,1,21/08/2023
"Have ordered four times now from Temu.   Never been let down.   My most recent purchase was a wedding outfit.  It is perfect.  Quality is really good, the fitting true to size.   Looks good on.  What?€?s more I went online looking for accessories and Temu was the only place that came up with what I had in mind so I?€?ve sent off another order.   I am not into any games and things and don?€?t want to be bombarded with offers so I?€?ve declined and can honestly say they make it just as easy to order for people like myself.   Furthermore, delivery has always been good and I am kept informed all the way.    I can?€?t see what?€?s not to like.",5,21/08/2023

"Watch out for TemuSupport protects the sellerSupporting excuses and liesI ordered many goods that were divided into several shipments,- PO-053-10222212158073823-D01 , PO-053-11725574349433823-D03 - PO-053-11725574349433823-D02 - , after receiving the parcel I was horrified, the parcels were taped in different ways, as if someone got into them, took the goods and re-sealed them , so it turns out that I didn't receive many goods, I contacted the chat support, and made a complaint, and also sent them a video of how I received the package and how it looked and how I unpacked it, what all came, when everything was finally rejected and she gave reasons!I quote:  /// After verifying with our warehouse, we have confirmed that your items have indeed been packed and shipped to you. Your package was also shipped in good condition. /// , so according to Tem, I am responsible for the shipping and if the package is opened or damaged on the way and the goods are stolen or lost, then the buyer is responsible for it.Temu is a big fraud that deceives customers and keeps sellers away, avoid this website, you will not get the goods or money back, the communication with the support is not up to par.Communication chat topicSomeone else could have interfered with the package during the transport process.And yet the complaint was rejected and since I claimed to have complained about several parcels with the same problem, the money will still not be returned to me, as if it were my fault that someone would steal the goods during transport. She literally robbed me of a lot of money.",1,22/08/2023

"Temu shopping is fabulous, addicting, fun, cheap and reliable. It is the best and just about only site I use for gadgets, household, clothing, gifts, linens, tools, home decor, etc. Their return policy is fast and easy. Items are almost always delivered in a week and a half. They give an approximate delivery date and if late give you a $5 credit. Great communication. I just don?€?t understand bad reviews unless from a competitor website. Products are quality and sold at a bargain. Shipping is free with $10 order and return shipping is free. You just have to look at the materials and sizes carefully.",5,22/08/2023
"No problem with order but been inundated with dodgy emails ever since placing. Mostly Temu, won a prize, claim your package etc. Constant and only since placing in order.Probably wouldn't order again even though prices are really good as not sure the security that strong?",3,22/08/2023
This company is excellent TEMU I've had over 30 orders now and not one problem with items or deliver. I have had some very well made items for extremely reasonable prices. Some of the really dirt cheap things are not the best quality but for what you pay you can't really complain. Delivery can be anywhere between one week and two weeks do be patient. You can check click on your order and track it every step of the way.,5,22/08/2023
I?€?ve bought some items from Temu. After one month Temu sent me a damaged package and some of them are damaged and missing. I?€?ve complained but Temu didn?€?t respond me. I think Temu is a big scammer. Be careful for buying something from Temu,1,22/08/2023
"I have bought loads of items from Temu. Always delivered when said it was going to be delivered, with good communication via email. Items have been good I really can?€?t complain about anything I have received so far. Definitely will buy again",5,22/08/2023
"I have to say that Temu has blown me away. I ordered a wallpaper with the wrong size. I chatted with them and I was very quickly refunded.  But I was surprised to still get updates.  I  contacted them and they told me that should the item arrive,  I could keep it if I  wanted. Wow Thank you",5,22/08/2023
"Didn't receive my order, tried disputing it through clearpay for me to prove their ""evidence"" wrong and they just kept sending the same message back when I proved they haven't delivered it to me, I can't even message them. The delivery photo was a picture of a foot and that's apparently proof of delivery, then they sent my address to me and apparently that's proof of delivery too, I'm disgusted. Avoid this place you won't get your order or your money back. After temu replied I messaged back with details and they've gone back to not helping me, is there any way I can post pictures to show you what they class as delivered? It's a man's foot, temu are choosing to ignore me because they know they haven't delivered my items.Messaged with my order number and still no reply, what a massive scam.Still no reply, clearly not going to get one avoid at all costs because you'll end up with no order and no money",1,22/08/2023
"So, I was trying to get the free stuff they say you can receive, through water harvest. What a joke. They say you can get referral water...

And they make it slow down to where if your not spending 20$ a day, you're not getting your free stuff.",1,22/08/2023

"I have found all the items of good quality and well made. Usually everything is packed beautifully but on this occasion A little wooden mouse I ordered for my daughter has a broken ear and tail. This was in a tiny plastic bag, just loose among the other goods and had worked its way to the corner of the package and somehow got broken, which is very disappointing. I have not found a return slip.",4,23/08/2023
"This company is legit. I have made many orders from temu, and have received them all with no problems. If there is a legit problem, they resolve it without question. I'm particularly impressed with the quality of their clothing, with immaculate stitching throughout. Yes, some of the gimmicks are a bit flimsy but they will refund if you're not happy. There are many scam companies out there, but Temu IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Thanks Temu.",4,23/08/2023
"This is my first order and I won't be ordering again I am afraid. Evri says they tried to deliver my order, and no one was there. I was at home. I contacted Temu and they said that there is nothing they can do about it, but rather I should be contacting Evri. Evri said that the sender needs to contact them. So, I am just stuck. Temu replied that once the item is returned to them, which they do not know how long it will take (usually 3 weeks!), they will refund me within 3 to 5 days. Unfortunately, this is not good enough. Not when I can order from other websites with better customer service and more prompt response when a customer is facing an issue!EDIT: Just to add, I contacted Temu about this. They told me that they would look into this and that they would offer a refund once they get the parcel back (exactly what they had already told me). So when I queried why they were not contacting Evri to see what happened with my parcel, they said that they couldn't. They gave me no explanation on how they would even look at what happened with the parcel if they did not contact Evri. Their only response was to simply reorder the item after I got a refund.",1,23/08/2023
"Utter garbage, like playing a cheap and nasty bingo site, lots of bells and whistles, but the content is that of Xmas crackers, save your money and go elsewhere, utter tat.Leave a review for your first purchase on Temu (#PO-210-01268747551350612)Tat tat tat like childrens plastic toys and cheap nasty carbage. AVOID RIP OFF!!!!!",1,23/08/2023
Placed my first order but items did not get delivered by Evri! proof of delivery was to a totally different address.Went on to customer service Temu - firstly they said it can be redelivered than connected my to a human customer service saying they can redeliver and i will get refunded within 5-14 days!!!!! Ridiculous!!Will never order from them againKnew it was a mistake ordering from Temu!be extra careful guys!,1,23/08/2023
"Ordered something, then noticed the address defaulted to a different address I didn?€?t type. There system is flawed.Immediately spoke to customer services. They couldn?€?t help and I think, I have been referred to a supervisor to sort out later. They then decided they have spoken me enough and that?€?s all I need to say so they aggressively kept  closing my online chat, and as suspected a day later just left my problem and still let my parcel to go out to the wrong address I didn?€?t type.Customer service think it?€?s ok to let the product I paid for go out to the wrong address and sort the problem laters, even though I tell them immediately.Customer service is a joke to let that happen!Won?€?t use them again! Trixy at customer service - the name suits her well!!!",1,23/08/2023
"I absolutely love Temu and have recommended them to other people.  I have always received my orders in good time (and there has been a lot) and the refunds have been quick and straighforward.

"1)My Google protection said, I needed to change my password. 2) They bait you in with low price, then make you spin the wheel for coupons to spend that they don't recognized. I saw Temu advertising on YouTube for low price, when I went to the site to buy, I was met with a spinning wheel, the 1st was win was $200.00. While shopping I was stopped by a 2nd spinning wheel that said I won $300.00. I didn't spend close to the amount, I was told I won but yet, for a pair of shoes that was under $3.00, my win was not recognized and my bill was over $116.00 dollars.",1,23/08/2023
"So many fake 5star reviews down here... just another chinese cheap and low quality market with slow delivery. The one thing that make this different to the others, is the huge amount of prompting emails you get from them, almost focing you to buy and buy and buy... Dont give them your email address or you get 10 emails a day. Its a level of hareastment. In terms of their products? Cheap, plastic, low quality and misalligned, size? Nah...",1,23/08/2023
"Would give zero rating if I could. Temu delivered my parcel and left on my doorstep at a different time than stated and it was stolen from there. They sent me a photo of it on the floor in full view of the street, telling me it was left in my porch. I don't have a porch! Temu would not give me a refund or replacement. DO NOT USE TEMU. They have my money and I have no parcel.UPDATE: Following my negative review of Temu they responded with how to request a refund. I have already requested and been denied a refund before submitting a review. This shows that Temu didnt even read my review properly. My review stands. Don't use them.",1,23/08/2023
"I have ordered a lot from Temu ! And happy with most what I have bought! . Delivery is fast, but  for some reason the people delivering is just putting packages anywhere . In full site from road .

"I absolutely love Temu!! I have never had a bad transaction or an item that wasn?€?t great quality or just what I?€?ve been been looking for, and all at fantastic low prices!! Just received several items that I?€?d ordered today and I loved every single one of them! ??????",5,23/08/2023
Very bad customer service  had 4 parcels they said they where delivered when iwent to get them they were not there got hold of customer service but they just said they were delivered so I just have to put up with it no replacement  or refund so iwill not be ordering again its not fair to lose all that money,1,23/08/2023
"Temu is a legitimate company. I've done one order with them. The delivery process was completely transparent, I knew where my parcel was at all times. It arrived in Canada within the predicted timeframe of one week. However the clothing items weren't up to my standards. I had to return both items. The top because it was polyester doubleknit which was too uncomfortable to wear. The skirt was too small in waist even though I followed the size recommendations. Not having a printer, I contacted the company, texted a chatbot who immediately put me through to a live person. That person refunded my money right then without having to return the garments. I have placed a second order with this company. Do understand that garments need to be upsized by about two sizes to match what North America would consider a normal size. The posted measurements don't include wear room for comfort.",4,23/08/2023
Have just received my 2nd order didn't go mad shopping on my first order as I was wary of using a new website and again everything arrived on time (despite the Christmas break) and were easy to track(much better than any other website I have ordered from) .All goods were as described and fitted(though I am still working out the sizing)Would recommend and am looking at ordering again for spring wardrobe.,5,23/08/2023
Good but can not rely on some sellers,4,23/08/2023
I have always had my Temu purchases delivered to my door. I now find you have changed this to a pick-up point for collection. I am 80 years old and am housebound. So it looks like I will not be purchasing from you again. I have spent a great deal of money with temu as you will see if you check your records. I am very disappointed you have lost me as a customer as I have always been very pleased with your service. But no more.  Barbara Smith.,1,23/08/2023

"Everything seemed to be going fine until, for some reason, the local carrier was already out for delivery and couldn?€?t deliver because of ?€?unknown recipient?€?. (I checked with the carrier all my info was correct). They say the sender (temu) could quickly fix this by sending some new instructions and they could even retry to deliver it later the same day.Temu didn?€?t offer any help regarding this and did not want to contact the carrier or supply me with important information that would allow me to fix it myself. They directly offered a refund but no help whatsoever.Two weeks waiting and with the shippment already on my area, wasn?€?t able to receive it. So frustrating.",1,24/08/2023
"Initially I gave Temu a one star review because I ordered 3 items. Suppose to arrive in 11x15 bag. Got 1 items in a tiny brown envelope. USPS tracking and UPS tracking said my order was delivered. There was no way for me to directly Tell Temu my order was sent incomplete. Since then, Temu customer service reached out and have rectified the situation and couldn't have been nicer. I will get my remaining items and I am very happy with the interaction.",5,24/08/2023

"I think people often just write reviews when they?€?ve had a bad experience and maybe not so much when it?€?s positive.. So I want to speak up because I?€?ve had a very good experience of this company. My order arrived within about a week. Everything is as expected. The items I ordered are just fun, silly things I haven?€?t seen anywhere else. The stuff is cheap, cheerful and enjoyable to order. I will definitely be a repeat customer.",5,24/08/2023

Living on a fixed income due to a sudden life threatening illness makes my heart happy I can go online to a company..(TEMU) and buy things i need/want that I can afford!! I have so many things from temu & actually have gotten a lot of compliments from most of them !!

"I was a bit skeptical if this was a legitimate site, I decided to buy a few things and they were delivered within a week sent from China, I have bought a lot more things and can?€?t believe the prices and the quality.

"About a month ago I  placed an order on Temu and I received it in time. I am pleased with my order (a shoulder bag). However, I would like to say that from the very first day I placed the order I have received an unprecedented number of junk emails. The majority of these emails have another recipient, but they end up in my mailbox. Why is it that? Does Temu give personal details of their customers to other companies? Whatever the case this is a security issue. I have been scammed in the past and I wouldn't like that happen again. I will not use Temu website again.",1,24/08/2023

This is theft in effect as refusing to give me my money back for the returned goods and missing item!  Dreadful!",1,24/08/2023
Found this site was a bit weary at first about delivery but hey they keep to there promises and there are loads of gimmicks and quirky stuff on there which are agood price and problem is now im addicted and just keep scrolling as there is always something that catches the eye Happy Shopping Peeps with Confidence,5,24/08/2023
I had items delivered damaged and temu refused to give a full credit. Customer service do not listen or answer any questions just cut and paste responses. They advised that they cannot escalate to a manager and they cannot raise a complaint. Totally backward company.Nothing was done despite contacting the company again as requested,1,24/08/2023
"I used to love temu, and got my packages at a reasonable time. Now both times in a row my package was not delivered! Support was unhelpful too, and when I went to refund it tried to pressure me into getting temu credit. I?€?m never shopping with this website again. You?€?re better off coughing up the extra cash for small businesses and trustworthy online shops.",1,24/08/2023
Temu are great.  When items were stolen off my doorstep Temu replaced or refunded the items without questioning.  I have found most of the items 95% are of good value.  A few did not work but you get what you pay for.  On the whole the service is good and you get the items on time.  Tracking the items is easy.,5,25/08/2023
Ordered like 5 items for about $20 which were never delivered to my address. Contacted customer service and was told ?€?after their investigation they can confirm the items were delivered to the correct address?€?. I have access to all of the same information they have and no where does it actually show the package on my porch. Additionally the tracking number provided shows it was delivered 1/5 but their website says 1/6. Which is it Temu? This is extremely frustrating as I would clearly not waste my time lying about an undelivered package that is only worth $20 unless it was really undelivered. Their customer service is subpar. I will be sticking with Amazon in the future who at least guarantees you get what you ordered and if you don?€?t they refund you. Temu should take notes.,1,25/08/2023
"I absolutely love Temu , everything I have brought from them I am thrilled with , I am so addicted to this site and always looking on there for my next order , I don.t care if they are in China or wherever they are great and so quick with shipping and the prices are fantastic , they will always have my support because it's like Christmas when you get the package and open it to see everything I have never been disappointed by them yet .keep up the good work Temu .",5,25/08/2023

Why bother with this as misleading!? Annoyingly I was waiting 2 weeks for them to arrive as needed them, if I'd known I would have purchased elsewhere sooner! And why is there no customer service contact details anywhere as I wanted to complain?? Very poor. Won't be using Temu ever again and won't be recommending them either",1,25/08/2023
"This company was good when it first came out with a wide range of products and great pricing. Now it's limited categories/items and everything is overpriced with most of the items much cheaper through Amazon. Then you have all these spam emails they send you like it's some great deal but it's all a scam, just like their contests and games like Farmland  - that I've been playing daily for 8 months only to barely get closer to the free gifts, yet you're forced to keep their app open for 15-20 mins while you play the game as it steals all your data. Had to uninstall app and delete account.",1,25/08/2023
"Ik heb kerstkado's besteld bij temu, vervolgens wordt de verzending over 2 pakketen verdeeld. Een daarvan werd door PostNL bezorgd en de andere door DHL.Beide pakketten staan op bezorgd maar niks hiervan is aangekomen. Nu kunnen beide bezorgservices mij niet helpen omdat temu een bezorg onderzoek moet starten, alleen als ik hier om vraag blijf ik in een soort loop hangen dat ik geen refunding/reshipment kan krijgen omdat hun underzoek aangeeft dat het wel bezorgd is.  Als ik aangeef dat ik niet om refunding/reshipment gaat maar alleen om het aanvragen van een bezorg onderzoek bij PostNL en DHL zodat ik met hun het probleem verder kan oplossen. Krijg ik een weer het zelfde domme IA antwoord als daarvoor: Thank you for waiting. Your patience is appreciated. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your order.

"I ordered for the first time from Temu, then shortly after, my Paypal account was hacked. I had not used my paypal in a while so I know it was probably from Temu.  I also now receive a tremendous amount of phishing scam emails to my inbox.  I then searched online and I read about a lot of other people who also had their credit card / checking information stolen after ordering from Temu.  After this incident, I deleted my Temu account and I will not order from them again.  I seriously do not trust their site nor their business practices and feel that my information is not secure.",1,25/08/2023

"Temu is not fraud. I have ordered several times: figurines, watches, some products for the kitchen, bathroom, clothes, shoes and I am very satisfied. The sizes are harmonized with the European ones. Once a product arrived damaged and when I wrote to them, I could buy something else for that amount and I didn't have to return the product.

Please don't order  from them. They didn't sent some items. They are not refunding for those missing items and also for the returned items you have to show proof that you returned the product otherwise their warehouse didn't find it . This mistake they did several times.They are scammers. Their Customer service is too bad . They are rude and they are not trying to solve the issue. They give you same repitive reply,1,26/08/2023

There was one small christmas decoration missing from one of my orders, and one pair of shoes were the wrong size but I was refunded both times within the hour. The sizes are occationally off and some of the clothes doesn't really scream ""quality"" but you get what you pay for and unlike other sites they always have real product photos (but also some fake ones).

"I've bought many items from Temu, from clothing to household items. The clothes have all fit well and been of average to good quality. The household items like a make up stand was a bit cheap and plastic. The delivery has been accurate and you're kept up to date with the tracking. Not returned anything so can't review the customer service. So far so good for clothes, bedding and stocking filler presents.",4,26/08/2023

Poor items sizing is out on many many many items and you have to repackage items and send then back and then wait for ages to receive any money back or not. So if you want cheap under sized items shop at temu.....avoid 0/10,1,26/08/2023
"Not trustworthyI purchased some items and everything was damaged ,so I returned it but I did not receive refund as they stated they did not receive it.The customer service is utterwaste.Both money and items were gone",1,26/08/2023
"I?€?ve ordered almost 40 times from temu since May 2023 and I?€?ve never had any problems. Most of the items have been as expected and of good quality (I?€?ve ordered clothing, crafts, electrical, health/beauty and some random items). Only a very small amount have needed returning, the process for this is extremely easy and refunds given quickly. I have only ever needed to speak to customer service once and whoever I spoke to was happy to help. Orders have arrived within the stated timeframe, and if they arrive late they provide ??5 credit (I?€?ve received this 3 times out of the 40 orders and even then the order arrived the next day). They also provide price adjustment refunds if an item has reduced in price since purchasing (I?€?ve had loads).I?€?ve never had any issues with money being taken from my bank other than what I know I?€?ve spent (I pay with my bank card). No random items added to my basket before paying. No nasty surprises. Don?€?t believe all of the people who claim it?€?s a scam because it?€?s not. One bad experience does not make a company scammers. People need to realise post can get lost wherever it may be from, and delivery drivers are Id!ots but they are completely separate so their actions do not reflect the service of temu. It?€?s 100% genuine with so many great items for great prices. Personally I will continue to use it. Give it a chance, don?€?t let scared people scare you.",5,26/08/2023

"Now my first review of Temu was removed due to me NOT having proof of what?€?s taken place previously and now, so I created a new account and on my 3rd transaction the problem arises it?€?s head ! So I made a purchase under invoice 210-12986394942073762). Friday past I decided to view my Temu account just to check on things, to cut a long story short, I made a purchase and paid for it !! Well so you?€?d think ?€?. So after the purchase I started looking for more items for later ?? Again so you?€?d think, because the items I viewed were then added to my above order without any notification to myself or no confirmation ?? I was shocked, and  phoned Temu to query what the additional cost was as I hadn?€?t purchased the items ? Temu then decided to cancel the order as I queried this purchase as I believe it was Fraudulent and notified my bank to advise, Temu then stated I requested to cancel the order ? Which I didn?€?t as I advised the customer service agent my query was about the viewed items put into my invoice number above, which they have now cancelled saying I requested it ?? I advised the agent Temu adding additional products to my purchase which I viewed was FRAUDULENT !!!! I now have the necessary proof should Temu attempt to say they did nothing wrong. In my opinion they added products and took more money without my consent, now even that Temu staff acted unprofessionally, the refund period will take over a month, and the original purchases was cancelled by Temu !!!!! I?€?m so annoyed with Temu, but this time iv taken the necessary steps to confirm I did nothing wrong, and I will have to have words with TrustPilot as they don?€?t like to upset the businesses who people review. Dear Temu if this issue is not resolved ASAP social media will know all about it !!!!!!! This review I confirm is truthful and correct and I have no intention to put Temu?€?s business into ill repute !!!!RESPONSE FROM TEMU Temu would love to understand your experience better, so they?€?ve asked for more details about your review?€?like an order number or email.If we don?€?t hear from you within 3 days, your review may be taken offline.MY RESPONSE - it?€?s all clearly explained in this review, if Temu can?€?t understand what they have done !! Then they shouldn?€?t be dealin in the International market?€??€?. My explanation is above, order number attached!!!!!",1,26/08/2023
"In my first order from Temu, it included a few tools and a cheap jacket and was happy with what I got. Second order, I bought a further jacket, work shoes and more tools. Most of the items at this stage is what I expected, not high quality stuff but what you would expect for the price you paid.That's the problem with some of these websites ... they draw you in. I love filming and have done so since the late 80's and my collection is now extensive, so I thought why not treat myself to a Temu camcorder ? The one I chose was the dogs boll*cks, it had everything, boom microphone, night vision, zoom control, 1020+4 k and even an 8k mode, complete with a remote control. A similar camcorder in the UK was about ??400 (even without the 8k mode), Temu price one hundred and forty quid... what could be so wrong? When it arrived it was like Christmas, well almost, it was New Year?€?s Day, and it came within 5 days from the date I ordered it.At first glance it was just cheap plastic, very light weight and one of the batteries was missing. Still as long as it performed I would be happy. That's when it all went t*ts up, I then notice on the inside flap of the box ""Warm"" (Yes it said ""warm"") ""for armature use only""Using it to do normal filming gave a reasonable quality, the zoom was digital so was very jerky, the problem with the 8k mode, there is nothing I know out there that is supported by it, such as monitor TV?€? etc (that's my fault I should have research it first). Using the touch screen to select the menu was at best, ""touch and go"" !! so you had to use the remote control. The night vision just turned the image into black and white so there were no boost in the light images. The sound was terrible, even with the boom microphone. I tried to use the finer adjustments to improve the images and sound but no matter what I did, it just made one thing improve, such as the light but it caused the colours to flare. I then compared the quality to my mobile phone that cost me about the same, and my mobile won on every setting, video, sound zoom quality etc. So it was packed up and sent back.So why am I giving them a five start feedback? Because I got my refund within a week and it did not set me a penny to send it back.Next question, will I order from them again?€? yes in fact I have re-ordered twice since then. My only word of warning is don?€?t spend more than you are prepared to loose in case you have problems with refunds.",5,26/08/2023
"Customer service is usually AI Bots. If you are dealing with returns, buyer beware and check out warranties before purchase, especially on higher price items. Updated 1/8/2024- Responding to the 'answer' from Temu, which is another bot or copy-paste. My experience was ordering a high priced blender. To make along story short, the manufacturer (Gemet) insert didn't even have their name and no way to get warranty work, which they said is for 1 year. In my 8 hours of back and forth with Temu, they said ignore manufacturer warranty and they would only accept returns for 90 days. They said contact manufacturer. I did. They said Temu handles after sale issues. It got to be a merry go round. And nearly every post to their customer service was a bot reply asking the same questions. Language was a barrier for sure. The customer service constantly had to 'check' with someone else. They could not answer one simple question on the warranty. Finally it got resolve but only after wasted hours and persisting. I have ordered other products and they were fine but customer service needs training and how to handle certain issues.",1,26/08/2023
"Well, setting aside that the orders take a long time to come and clothing items can often be on the small side, they are very cheap and have free shipping and their returns process is very efficient. However it's their admin side I have the biggest problem with. For a start their reference numbers are incredibly long and If you make the slightest mistake inputting your info, or queery, or answering on line, you have to start all over again with your email address and id number and order number...which takes ages and is very frustrating. Two of my last order confirmations have not been received and were probably sent to my old email address. Despite my changing my account to their new updated and more secure double verification code system, these orders were placed without using the correct email address on their web site. Their ""chat"" on line was absolutely no help and I cannot get any satisfactory outcome, to my attempts to change those orders, or indeed find out why they were accepted without using their more secure system. I do not use the old address any more, but when I tried to get any sense out of Temu to update these orders to my correct email address...there was apparently no way!!!",2,27/08/2023
"Edited Review:Overall, temu are pretty great. A very small percentage of products I have received aren't as great as I hoped - but still worth what I paid tbh. About 1/4 of what I order has been far better than I expected and better quality than I have seen anywhere else! Majority of what I order is what I expected... Decent quality for amazing value!Parcels usually arrive within 2 weeks and often much faster.I did have a big issue with customer service via email. I followed the advice in the response though and the issue has been sorted after a 4 day battle via email. If you do have issues - use the chat service.Thank you Temu!",5,27/08/2023
"Love Temu I was a bit wary at 1st but have had loads of orders since last year you get what you pay for,always read the reviews before you buy an item as they can come smaller than you think they are in pic,but it does say the size on it im waiting for baby shower balloons and arch hopefully they come b4 sat 13th can't wait",5,27/08/2023

Always have an open mind when ordering from Temu. Have ordered quite a few times and I've had a mixture of quality items. Some fantastic. Some not so. But that's the risk with buying from a company like this isn't it?! Everything I've ordered has been usable. Only iffy items have been some cheaper material used for some of the clothes. I've had some brilliant clothes arrive too :),5,28/08/2023

Just terrible - they have this fake spinning wheel for you to land on certain discount amounts for clothing and merchandise and once you land on a percentage off nothing ever goes forward from there.One time I was told I?€?d get a dress for 100 percent off - another time it said I?€?d get an item for 80 percent off - also never happened or heard anything after spinning their discount ?€?wheel.?€?What a scam - they get your information and then who knows what they do with it since I got not one item from them after giving them my information.,5,29/08/2023
"Ordered several clothing items from Temu.  Found the quality was fantastic.  Loved the constant discounts.  Biggest factor I loved about Temu was they had a sizing option to tell you based on the size you wear now what you should order, and loved the quality.  Every item I got fit correctly even if it was ""sized to my US size,"" and the clothing has maintained its quality.  The down side was returns.  I had one item that I wanted to return because it arrived to late, however, I personally felt the hassle of dealing with the return and my time associated wasn't worth using their 90 day free return policy because the price of the item was so minimal.  I do appreciate they have a 90 day free return policy I just don't want to hassle with it.  :)",4,29/08/2023

It is 100% my own experience of using this company and my review is given because they deserve it. They aren't perfect but they are damned close to it. Far better than I expected and they have now become my 'Go to' company for all things never missed or needed until spotted on their site. ????Thank you Temu and please keep up your present standards and I predict a long and prosperous future for you.",5,30/08/2023
Bought 2 over the shoulder bags. Both are crap. The belts are not fastened securely as a consequence they come off willy nilly. So off the bin they go!The label- Jingpinpj and Jingpindaisu. Do not be conned. Do not buy these items.,1,30/08/2023
"I hope TEMU never changes. They?€?re excellent, high quality and ultra fast free delivery! ????",5,30/08/2023
"** I downgraded this to a 1 after the lies from the reply. I was told they would redeem themselves and I get told the same thing over and over. I asked for a manager and again the same response. The item is clearly labelled out of stock so I don't need to go round in circles. Absolutely awful, too many lies.For the most part Temu have been fine and helpful, items tatty at times but some very good.However what sticks is this poor interaction. I have a parcel delivered and one item was out of stock. In chat they even call themselves incompetent but still refuse to refund the out of stock item. Be very cautious.",1,30/08/2023
Love it. They always have something to tempt me!,5,30/08/2023
"Temu use straightship courier service that fails to deliver my order. They claim they did however i never received it. Contacted temu but im getting the standard bs from their manual of sorry. I did get a refund, but i rather have my order(s). Also i have to wait 2 weeks for the refund. Wasted weeks of choosing, ordering, waiting for my goods, but it never arrived. Temu refuse to change courier although many people complains about the same issue, which makes temu an accomplice. This is unacceptable and unprofessional.  I will never order anything from temu, nor recommend them. Zero star if possible.",1,30/08/2023
"Cheap products, over priced and games that scam you. Honestly garbage",1,30/08/2023
I had a bad experience with temu. I told them to deliver my package in front of my door but they delivered nearby my mailbox. I also never got my order. I tried to issue a refund but I couldn't. I still don't have my package and I lost my money.,1,30/08/2023
I could not believe the low prices would result in quality goods.  I ordered several tops. While they did not have finishing touches like tapering and how the fabric lays around my neck and shoulders...the size was correct and the colors very good.  These were casual tops to wear at home.  I do have a concern why they offer Paypal and then won't follow through so I had to use another credit card.,4,30/08/2023
Cheap prices. About half of what i would pay on ebay. Excellent communication and speedy delivery.,5,30/08/2023
"I started using Temu a few weeks ago and I have to say that I am enjoying it immensely.  I like buying useful little gadgets.  Yes some are a bit flimsy made but you get what you pay for.  Some are absolutely great and do their job well.   I love the free shipping as it means that the price you see is the price you pay.  I have made over half a dozen orders in the past few weeks and they have all arrived in great time with great communication.  Yes there are lots of emails/texts/whatsapps but when I get fed up of getting those I will just unsubscribe from them to get a break.  At the moment it's fine as it's giving me an insight into all the things they do have for sale.  The price is great, they arrive timeously and I have not had any issues as yet so long may it continue.",5,30/08/2023
"I've used Temu once the app is OK I like it but now the website is a whole different story, ""The items are gone, Click to retry"" and that is every single category? Just seems really strange. It's creeping me out a bit.Delivery is quicker than you expect.If I can actually browse anything then OK I'll shop here more seeing as eBay has said ""I can never have eBay again""Update: In response to Temu's response I shall wait, I hope it's fixed.",2,30/08/2023
"I have ordered from Temu 3 times, and I've had no problems with the products or the delivery. Always delivered fast, and in a good condition. As a consumer I personally only buy the things that are already reviewed on, so I have an idea if the products actually fit the description, and by doing that I think I have been lucky to receive products that lived up to my expectations. So that's the biggest tip I have, for ordering on Temu. All in all, very happy customer.",5,30/08/2023
Excellent company good value for money good quality products would recommend,5,30/08/2023
"My guardian had started to order from here, I was shocked on the good quality. So I decided to get Temu for myself! They do incredible discounts which is where I started of with. The deal was: 70% off if you buy 3 items. I scrolled throughout the options it had give me and I found 2 things I adored! But the deal only happens if you get 3. So I continued scrolling and I saw something else. I pressed ?€?buy?€? and what would?€?ve been around ??31, was only ??11.95! On 4th Jan (which is today!) it arrived and I was nervous, in case it was a scam. I unboxed my packages and everything was how it looked in the pics, I had bought a fake Stanley mug, white air humidifier and a lovely bracelet. You can also track your parcel! The only bad thing is that the minimum checkout price is ??10, apart from that Temu is my saviour! Helping me find amazing products at very little cost. Thank you Temu for you?€?re hard work!",5,30/08/2023
"You can find real gemstones in Temu. Since I made my first order, I have been going back, ordering again and again. It?€?s so so easy to shop, cancel or add items before shipment, and get a refund if you wish to return something. It?€?s a five star company for me, if you have an eye for the good items! Never had any problems, and I?€?m totally satisfied.",5,30/08/2023
Received my order today Just want to say/ write how very very pleased I am with the rug I ordered.It is beyond my expectations   and so reasonably priced am about to order another 2!!,5,30/08/2023
"The worst shopping online website ever. Fake offers, they try to capt your attention with different offers and free gifts which are not free as they are conditioned and you will never get them. The same happen with those games where they say you can get items for free, they will make the game harder and harder as you will never get anything free. They only try to catch you to make shopping with them. Also the items quality is very poor and disappointing. I've uninstall the app as I receive daily annoying emails and text messages.",1,30/08/2023
"Ordered a musical keyboard for my 4year old grandson as a Christmas present, Arrived well packaged, opened on Christmas morning as Santa had been, sadly it was just the shell casing within the box. On contacting TEMU they wouldn`t help as they claimed the item was out of stock, I can only assume then that there was many disappointed children on Christmas morning. Buyer beware!!!",1,30/08/2023
"I have ordered a few times from Temu and been completely satisfied each time.  In one order I bought a mini remote camera, the price was super cheap and the build quality, as expected, commensurate with the price, couldn't get it to connect to my WIFI, raised a return. Instant reply and immediate refund no problem at all. Bought lots of kitchen and bathroom accessories which are just as good as on the high street but less than half the price.  I also like the fact that they offer a lot of natural products and non plastic goods as well as the usual plastic stuff so that I have a choice not to buy plastic.  Delivery was quick considering the distance and all the orders have been properly fulfilled. I bought an endoscope, considering the price, I expecting poor quality and connectivity, it is first class and connects to my phone perfectly.  Would have cost 3 x as much from other suppliers.",5,30/08/2023
I ordered my items after reading the reviews i took a chance and orderedWas very happy came faster than expected by royal mail Quality excellent very happyToday After spending time reading more reviews I found some worried me data protect unexpected payments taken from bank taken parcels not arriving no proof no refund poor customer service and fake reviewsDeleted app and taking precautions with bank and blocked emails Sorry wont be ordering again Just don't want any of that to happen to me can do without the stress,5,30/08/2023
"Temu removed the PayPal payment option from my account and wanted my credit/debit card details to be able to make future purchases. I contacted Temu Customer Service only to be told that ""anomalies"" had been found with my account. I asked what those ""anomalies"" were but they could not, or would not, tell me. Previous to this happening, I have not had any issues with Temu. I have not shopped with them for several months so perhaps they didn't like that?I have kept screenshots of the conversation with Temu representative as proof of what was said to me. Temu states that they accept PayPal but obviously they don't. I will not give Temu my credit/debit card details.",1,30/08/2023
From Greece. Ordered 4 times. Low quality 2 times. Better the next 2.   You get what you pay for. Big problem with the couriers they use in Greece. Anyway i will not order again.4-1-2024I never asked for refund and do not wish nothing from temu. I made 4 orders. 2 were rubbish and were thrown away. The other 2 were okay. These things happen when you buy in the internet. I wish no further communication. Thanks.,1,31/08/2023
"I initiated my initial purchase on Temu on November 30th, followed by another order on December 1st. Despite both orders being marked as delivered, I did not receive some items. Upon requesting a re-shipment, I anticipated two deliveries in the first week of January. However, although the courier claimed both were delivered, I only received one parcel. When I contacted Temu's customer support, my concerns were casually dismissed without a thorough inquiry, despite providing emails, pictures, and app updates as evidence. Despite the company's indifference to my predicament, I wouldn't have bothered reaching out if I actually had the missing items. While it may be a trivial matter for them, the integrity of this company is questionable.The representatives were unhelpful and seemed disinterested in resolving my issue. Communication was poor, and it felt like my concerns were ignored. Overall, it was a frustrating and disheartening encounter that left a lasting negative impression.",1,31/08/2023
"I like shopping with Temu and have had great experiences, even helped me when I have had issues. Only Problem is they use a shipping company Straightship for some of their shipments and I have no choice with it.  This company has a bad rap, rude customer service, and packages go missing. I Already lost a order during transit and they said it was ""delivered"", non of my neighbor have seen it, my security camera show no delivery vehicle during the time they said it was dropped off. I am fearing I may never get my money back which will be a big hit for me and Christmas. If the next few shipments I have coming in with the same company go missing I may have to close my Temu account as I can not loose money like this.  I wish I had a choice as a customer to choose who I am using as a courier.",4,31/08/2023
"I have ordered only a few times from TEMU and have enjoyed the experience. HOWEVER, I ordered 3 things in Dec 2023 and ONTRAC is saying it has been delivered and It has NOT.  I have been trying to get this resolved to no avail. Can you just resend my items, PLEASE. They are Xmas presents and my grandbabies are waiting on them.  Thank you so much. I will not let this deter me from ordering more items, I like the variety of stuff that you all carry and the pricing is most welcoming!!",3,31/08/2023
"I ordered from Temu 7 times. Every order was in the range of 20-35 Euro. All items were always delivered on time and in good condition, except for one package that got lost in Spain during delivery. I contacted support and they arranged the package, worth more than 30 Euro, to be re-shipped. I received it. So far the service is excellent. I will keep buying from Temu as their prices are competitive and delivery is fast. Customer support is very responsive and helpful.",5,31/08/2023
"AVOID - products marked stainless steel are clearly tin and nothing arrives looking as advertised. You'd get more value for money going to buy your plastic goods at the corner shop, as that plastic might last more than one use.",1,31/08/2023
"Temu began with enticing initial offers for the first 2-3 orders, providing a favorable start. However, once you transition from being a new customer, the offers cease. Despite the attractive low prices, the quality is disappointingly poor, and the delivery time is unacceptably long. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of a customer service contact number or email for addressing issues.I made several attempts to reach out to customer service regarding my lost package, but regrettably, no satisfactory solution or assistance was provided. Consequently, I ended up losing approx ??50 without any resolution. I strongly advise against falling into this trap.Continuing from my previous message, I made persistent attempts to contact customer care, investing nearly an hour each time to articulate and clarify the recurring issue. Although they advised me to seek confirmation from Evri, which I promptly obtained, the resolution with Temu remains elusive. Regrettably, my diligent efforts have not yielded a satisfactory solution. Notably, one representative successfully initiated a ticket, but to my dismay, it was closed without any accompanying explanation. This has left me thoroughly disheartened. For your records, this delivery included multiple orders (which can be find with delivery date 23 Dec) so including primary order number  is: [PO-210-06486757320312278].",1,31/08/2023
"Well I have to say I'm impressed, I've been purchasing off temu for about 6 months now and had some very good quality items and a very reasonable price. I'm also very impressed with their refund policy as if a refund has been needed its basically gone back in my account straight away I've had no concerns with this site and will continue to use",5,31/08/2023
"I have ordered several times  Some of their product is smaller than the photo looks but overall I have had a good experience. Some things are cheap but also cheap price, Most things I have liked but last month I ordered a pretty looking purse  Was so disappointed when I got it, I went to send it back and TEMU refunded and told me to Donate the purse ,",5,31/08/2023
I am very satisfied with orders and with this online shop,5,31/08/2023
I placed an order i never received it. I contacted temu through the website. They keep telling me my order was delivered and they had confirmatio. I asked each time and they wont send me confirmation and they write back and say the order is confirmed delivered in Dayto ohio. I live in indiana... they say nothing theh can do about it.,1,31/08/2023
"I have contacted customer service several times who state that once an item is sent, it?€?s my responsibility. Temu choose the courier, so why am I being penalised. How on earth can I be responsible for an item I have not received. Temu is a scam!Update! They keep saying under section11.1 I am responsible for an item that has been despatched. I am not until the item is in my hands. I need someone senior to contact me!",1,31/08/2023
"Edit to add: temu responded with a comment (as seen below) and then requested trust pilot remove my review because they think it?€?s fraud (I sent in my receipts because it definitely isn?€?t fake). Big ick. I immediately deleted the app and highly recommend you do the same. Reviews are for the people and for you to fix yourself. I initially gave you a 3/5 which is AVERAGE. Dropped to a 1 for such a poor response.  It's Hit Or MissWhen we order electronics there is a 99.99% chance they won't work at all. But we have ordered some tshirts that have worked out fine. Dresses are also hit or miss, often not sized for american women so be wary. Everything is insanely cheap and it's FOR A REASON... you get what you pay for. Great for costuming or cosplayers!",1,31/08/2023
"So disappointed with quality. I cannot wear any of the 5 items. The sizing was inaccurate and the fabric like plastic, when I researched the fabric when purchasing was led to believe it wasnt polyester.. I wasn't able to work out how to return as very complicated so my bad luck.. their app like a virus I got hassled via email. My last purchase was because I thought I won something but was conned into purchasing.. never again",1,31/08/2023
"I bought a pair of slip on shoes. They fit well, they looked good for 2 weeks and then the outer surface which lovely at first got rained on, not soaked, just rain drops. The our surface is now like a brick. It's nowonder they are cheap because that really is what they are.In addition to this, temu wan me to return the items in the same bag they came in a month ago with the original barcoad on otherwise I won't get refunded, what cheap tricks they pull on their customers....Absolute diabolical",2,31/08/2023
I have 3 orders still sitting in mississauga from dec19 and has not arrived. Contacted customer service with regards to it and got no help except excuses. Poor customer service. I tried everything by contacting temu but nothing ever happened. They kept giving excuses.Finally got my order.  It arrived with wrong items.  The package had been opened and revealed. Was refused refund. Horrible company,1,31/08/2023

The best App ever! It never disappoints,5,01/09/2023
Temu do not cater for disabled customers they except small returns but anything over a certain a price your not getting a refund it's junk plastic junk copy of the real thing stay away specially if you're disabled they do not cater for disable customers temu pays trustpillet to remove negative comments they don't have a landline number it's experiencing high calls at the moment that's all they say lol and if you bought something contact your bank and ask for a new card because temu only wants your bank details watch out,1,01/09/2023
"Overall not a bad company to deal with, and quickly sent me a refund for one of the items I was not happy with due to its poor quality!Only criticism is that some items are cheap because they are of a poor quality not because they are being discounted.",4,01/09/2023
"TEMU Review Submitted January 2nd 2024The TEMU employees, CHAT reps and sellers are slow to respond with feasible knowledge. After ordering a few days before I was sent an email that said I would receive my items the next day...turns out I still haven't received them...it is now 3 days later. I was offered and given a complete refund and apparently the items are still coming? I wanna know who really wins when you use TEMU? I am disappointed with the shipping process yet if I receive the items I've been refunded for, THEY LOSE? There are plenty of nice products but their shipping notices are deceptive or vague. The chat reps SLOW. The sellers seem to NOT answer questions directly or descriptively and lack important answers in their ads? I asked a seller whether their sunglasses were ""POLARIZED"", seller answers back saying they are ""UV protected"". Polarized and UV protection are not the same? They are separate issues relating to safety features re: sunglasses. If I receive the shipment that I am long awaiting for, I have already spent more of my personal time ""teaching"" their chat reps the value of proper answers? If I receive the items regardless of the refund given, guess I earned it. TEMU, get real and get ""professional"". I'm not sure TEMU is worth using it at this point?",2,01/09/2023
"Absolutely terrible customer service. I was a first time buyer and qualified for some discount vouchers if I spent a certain amount of money on their site. I spent over double that amount and did not receive the vouchers. I spoke with someone on their Customer Service team and they refused to help, even when I supplied them with screen shots of the offer I was sent and what I'd spent. I was then passed to another representative called Kersen who also refused to help and just kept pasting generic ""answers"" that didn't resolve my query. They then kept trying to cut off the chat repeatedly. I wish I'd read the reviews on here before using them.?€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€?Update 02/01/24:Their response to my review, and many other customer reviews, just reiterates my point. It looks like they haven?€?t even bothered to read it and have just used another one of their generic cookie cutter responses. Their reply asks me to message them via the Live Chat function of their app, which is what I originally did and where all the issues arouse in the first place! What an embarrassing way to run a business.",1,01/09/2023
"Had 2 orders consolidated into one shipment, Evri Hermes who temu arranged to make delivery failed to deliver the items to my address, the photo, GPS and Evri confirmed this, and so item was declared missing.

"Bought from here a few times, everything is relatively cheap and arrives in times you would expect from China. You do get what you pay for so if it is cheap it is not going to be the best quality.",4,01/09/2023
"I returned some items to Temu and they gave me a partial refund of ??10 as opposed to the full refund of ??44 claiming that some items were not received and yet they were ALL in one parcel. They wanted photos of me packaging the items as proof! In a modern world where we take pictures of almost everything, sadly I hadn?€?t taken one of me returning an order(!) Also I ordered a beard trimmer and received a pet grooming tool and their reason for not offering a refund was I had ordered the correct item!I know my rights to receive a full refund under UK law, I?€?m surprised this company is able to operate in the UK. I will be making a complaint to the financial ombudsman so other people don?€?t get scammed.",1,01/09/2023
False and misleading listings. Purchased 10 items.  Listing clearly showed items included bags. Items received with no bags. Contacted Temu support but of course they find in favor of supplier and cost me $100 to send back.,1,01/09/2023
"Overall I really enjoy shopping with Temu. The prices are excellent and the range of goods is extraordinary. I love the clothing, OK it?€?s not always the highest quality in the world but you get what you pay for. It?€?s certainly NOT rubbish. I?€?ve bought shirts, trousers, sweaters and all of which I am very pleased with. I?€?ve had problems with delivery at times but that is not down to Temu but the courier company they use in the UK namely EVRI. EVRI must be costing Temu a small fortune in refunds for packages that never arrive. Temu are always good to their word and refund when something doesn?€?t turn up but I don?€?t think it?€?s their fault. A local chat room for where I live continuously sight EVRI for non delivery and parcels just disappearing. I would rather pay a bit more and be certain of receiving my goods. Temu now use local post offices as drop off places for parcels which will hopefully stop EVRI using the excuse they couldn?€?t find the delivery address.",4,01/09/2023

I?€?ve start looking at their website few months ago then start shopping.Of course not every single item I ordered for different reasons didn?€?t work. Temu had been FANTASTIC fast no question asked and few times even asked to keep item and refund my money.Quality of what you pay for is excellent.Ships fast and on always on time.I have not stopped anywhere as professional as this company.I?€?m at their site daily and order household clothing detergent craft tools and much more..Your fantastic customer service and true value for what you charge is ???? Wishing Temu more success on 2024,5,02/09/2023
"I was hesitant at first listening to hear say, but friends had tried it and loved it, so I tried it and it's amazing so many gadgets and gift ideas, for me personally out of several orders I have placed and nearly 50 items I would say 2 items where of a quality that was lower than advertised, but the majority of the items are excellent especially for the price. Quicker delivery than Wish with excellent tracking and delivery updates. Some out of this world offers like 90% off a pair of trainers making them ??2.24 with free delivery you kind of think they won't arrive, but they do and they are actually accurate and comfortable. I definitely would recommend the site.",5,02/09/2023
"Out of many items I ordered from Temu, more than ??400 worth of assorted now, i could say i am only satisfied with 4 items. The rest of the items are either not of the material you would expect, issue with sizes.. few stuff i ordered came way too small compare to what it described online, few items came with missing parts which makes them useless. Most if not all heavy duty items came very flimsy or weak NOT as described or presented (false impression) on the image. Finally there is no consistency, bought 2 pair of shoes and both came same sizes but completely different materials and designs. Definitely i would not purchase any clothing or shoes from Temu and perhaps will never order anything from now on from them.",2,02/09/2023
"I'm trying to get a refund from temu as they have stated my order of 134 was delivered to my address but the photo that was taken to.prove delivery is not my address. How ia this fair.

"Temu products are very low quality. All the Christmas items I bought from Temu did not last more than one wash and the Christmas lights were almost dead on arrival. The Temu fish game is a total scam, please don't attempt to start it as temu will make you stay on their app almost 3 months, make you refer them to friends,  make you buy from them to continue playing the game only to tell you at the tail end that you still need to buy items worth over ??100 and refer them again to get items you won.

"Temu started off really well. But over the months they have clearly reached the point they want to be at as they no longer seem to care about customers or the quality of tge items they are sending out. I have several screen shots of instances where the customer service have openly avoided my concerns/issues and simply reply with scripted paragraphs making them no more helpful than a bot, whilst then being rude to me and trying to close the chat because i dont just accept what they are saying. Beware using this app as it is likely you will receive faulty, damaged or counterfeit goods.",1,02/09/2023
"This new shipper Supai does not give accurate delivery info. This is the second day I've been told out for delivery with nothing showing up.

Can drivers not read or are they just too lazy to open the gate and deliver by my front door?",2,02/09/2023
I mostly liked this items I bought. Some stuff is smaller than depicted and the quality is off but you get what you pay for. The Bedding I found to be great.

I love shopping Temu only thing I don?€?t like is almost all the clothes are pretty much polyester.

"Cheap prices,  but quality of merchandise is a bit hit and miss.I bought from places/items with decent reviews,  that it not a sign of quality or that the reviews are good?Some items saw blades went blunt after one use on plastic water pipe. Automatic led strip light, only keeps charge for 3 days, with very little use, and feels cheaper that another company I purchased from.Read all descriptions about items, some look like metal  but are in fact nylon.",3,02/09/2023

"I love this company. The prices are affordable. The quality of everything I've ordered has been fine. Contacting them is very simple. When I'm not satisfied with product they tell me just keep the product and we'll refund you. That is under a certain dollar amount. But most of the items are low dollar anyway. The phone reps are pleasant. I like the company. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because shipping time. But if you don't get your product by a date specified, they give you a credit. How nice is that? Temu is focused on customer satisfaction.",4,02/09/2023
"Don't leave items in your cart.  On several occasions I have caught Temu raising the price of items I put in the cart at lower prices.   I don't know about China but in the USA that's called ""bait and switch.""  Not surprisingly  I never saw them LOWER a cart price! This problem expanded when they raised the shipping minimum to $20, which might cause you to leave items in your cart longer giving them more time to surreptitiously jack up the price.",2,02/09/2023

"Some of the items are legitimate items that are overstock, some are cheap knockoffs so beware. Do not play their game for coupons an free stuff it's a scam that you can not win it seems for the first couple of days that you have a chance take fishland for example I start off with 5 5gram bags of food to collect fish by day 4 and 70% it's 12 g per at day 7 89.2% it is 1500g per fish each fish equaling 2 cents at 91 % it is 1500g per fish equaling 1 cent even with purchases and adding friends you stand no chance of winning anything it's a scam so do not bother. So buyer beware with purchases some are really good buys but a lot are cheap knock offs and their games are scams to rope in others with 0 real incentive. We tried and tested items side by side with legitimate items and 12 people participated to be referrals the games are straight pyramid schemes.",3,03/09/2023

Pathetic!!!Update.From the answer that you gave it to me, is quite obvious that you are aware of the situation and you did that in purpose ( you just want to catch people to download the app), you never had the intention to sell the product whit the price from the offer",1,03/09/2023

"Worse experience ever! First time purchase with Temu and order didn?€?t get delivered. Evri taken a picture of the parcel being left outside a closed door, by the time I returned home the parcel was gone. Tracking is horrible and wrong information provided. Temu refused to help me, when I asked for proof that the parcel was delivered they ignored my question. I even asked to speak a manger and got refused. The worse customer service. Do not order from this website it?€?s a scam! They?€?re quick to take your money but not willing to help at all.",1,03/09/2023

"Fantastic prices, great products and fairly fast delivery ???€ I've bought some great products from Temu and as long as you read the description properly you really can't go wrong! Just about everything you can think of they sell at a cheaper price than anywhere else! If you plan ahead a bit you really can get a fantastic product,  just as long as you read the description properly as this is where most people go wrong!! I will continue to recommend Temu to my friends and shop with them for future gifts etc.  Your biggest problem will be stopping yourself from adding items to your cart because you can't resist a bargain ????",5,03/09/2023
"I love Temu????I have ordered so many times since my daughter recommended it to me.It has honestly helped my family have a great Christmas ???It is affordable and as with any other sites that sell from various sellers , there are amazing quality products of top notch quality and then there are some poorer quality items.It doesn't matter though as Temu have one of the best return policies I have ever known.They will always offer a refund and return at no cost to you, so you Do not lose out.I can only guess the bad reviews have some ulterior motives.As for shipping it is fantastic, I ordered many separate orders before Christmas and recieved all of them on time.Even the order I put in a week before Christmas managed to arrive on time.It really is a fantastic platform with many of the exact same items being sold on the high street at  5 -10 times the priceI thought it was too good to be true and was delighted when they proved me wrong , thankyou Temu",5,03/09/2023

"I?€?ve decided to re-write my review of Temu. I was at first very impressed. However, lately, I?€?ve become a bit fed up. First: I don?€?t have confidence in their advertised prices. Temu are always saying that each item has so much discount and so on. Yet, that doesn?€?t appear to be true. Almost every item is apparently discounted. Second: It often feels like a casino not a shopping site. There are frequent pop ups telling you this and that and randomly saying you are special; you are a winner; you?€?ve been picked; the offer is just for you. All of it is fake. Money off vouchers often come with a very short time to use them, often it?€?s 24 hours. So, you place an order for ??50 and they give you a voucher. They want you to use that voucher within 24 hours. Add in the pop ups, the constant telling you of how special you are and the highly suspect pricing, and suddenly you are really feeling manipulated. I think Temu should be used only for ordering products you actually want from other sites. Check Temu?€?s pricing. Don?€?t get drawn in to their fake advertising and casino culture.",3,04/09/2023
"I ordered a lot of staff and most of it good for value but I have used ??30 off for ??60 coupon for an item and they have sent me wrong item and my coupon is burned then I reported the issue and they offered me 20% discount instead of my 50%  And they didn't send me the correct item with same price too. that's a shame, unacceptable.",2,04/09/2023

"This is a scam and fraud company.  They keep jumping and advertising false offers. You get an advert on face book for a shoes at ??7 and when you go and choose your size, the price jumps to ??25 !. The same happens with everything! When you buy even at the high price, the quality is rubbish and turns out to be more expensive than buying from high Street or amazon.They decieve customers pushing them to buy rubbish quality products.

"Cheap stuff with null service /shipment. If the missed any item is the buyer fault. No refund policy because the individual are forced to pack in front of a camera. But have you checked how the items are delivered...? Obviously no.

Absolute cheap stuff and they don't even have a proper customer service. When i requested for refund after packing and posting waiting for weeks  all they could say was product not received. How ridiculous bloody fraudsters.  Temu order (#PO-210-04765479660152330),1,05/09/2023
I started using Temu and loved it and have spent a great deal of money with them - at first it was great as min spend was only ??5 so was affordable to me - then it went up to ??10 - I still used it with weekly orders even though it meant that I often missed out on the deals as they expired before I could afford to spend the tenner - now I'm gutted to find that only a few weeks later they have again upped it and its now a min of ??15 - I am not able to spend that much in one go so sorry Temu you have now lost a very valid customer as I can no longer afford to use your site - im sure many others will be in the same boat so pls put it back to ??10 min spend or I wont be buying again!!,1,05/09/2023

I ordered a t shirt, cap, trainers, going out top and underwear. All arrived within 12 days (over Christmas too!) and there's not one thing I would send back. It was all far higher quality than I expected, fit as described and I would definitely order from them again. Sure they try and get you to buy more with strange pop ups and coupons and time limited offers but overall this is a great value site for products that frankly you can't buy in the UK. Customer service chat when asking about delivery times was also good.",5,05/09/2023

Items were with me for one week before  the chains that were supplied with them on all three rusted though and broke. Returning them for me will be difficult as I?€?m disabled. The return just isn?€?t worth the problems that it would entail for me to receive a refund. The chains supplied with these items arrived broken and I had to fix them before I could use them at all. Then after one week of being used as explained above they were useless. Think  hard before purchasing these items the chains just aren?€?t adequate or fit for purpose.,1,05/09/2023

"This review is following my 3 attempted orders with Temu. Between ads that contain false information (selling plastic as leather, polyester for cotton and unidentified fabric as wool) and shipping small and fragile items in plastic bags that allow for damage and losses, I'm calling it quits. No more Temu, Aliexpress, or DHGate. I'm done with China.In response to the reply by Temu I can tell you that the treatment that I received was nothing like their written policy. How can anyone return items for a refund if they are missing from an order? I will get Visa involved in this one. Buyer beware/Caveat Emptor.",1,05/09/2023
I had to review the somewhat controversial Temu given my positive experiences! I honestly can?€?t fault them - having received some really wonderful items from Temu at a fraction of the cost of anywhere else! There have been 1 or 2 ?€?duds?€? but that?€?s to be expected when you?€?re paying such low prices! The parcels always arrive so quickly and on the one occasion that my parcel went missing (delivery companies fault not Temu) - the refund process was the quickest and easiest I?€?ve ever experienced! So for me - I honestly can?€?t fault this company!,5,05/09/2023
"Return process is a breezy. And it?€?s not top luxury products, but definitely worth what you pay, and some! Yes depending on your order amount it does take longer for shipping, but hey you want it cheap, can?€?t have it both ways. Never had a problem and you get a 5$ credit when they don?€?t meet the promised shipping date. There?€?s even a 7 day price adjustment. Can?€?t beat it!",5,05/09/2023
"What an experience. Temu site is very alluring, games , spinning wheels for discounts . Very pushy to get u to buy . However, it?€?s been a returning fiasco. Broken pieces , missing parts , late packages as well as extremely poor quality items . Happy to be out of their addictive , deceptive and pushy site . Update , be sure and keep track of ur lengthy ID and reference # . Which is confusing . No customer service . Worst company in the history of companies wonder if theirs ANY way to stop the harassment from emails and text messaging. Wonder ??? I have tried my hardest to get this done .

"Temu sellers have unlawfully appropriated my registered designs and are using my product photos without authorisation. Despite filling over 70 intellectual property (IP) reports, Temu removes the listings only to have the same sellers promptly create new ones. My attempts to seek assistance from Temu via email have resulted in generic responses, stating they take IP infringement seriously and asking for further reports for removal.This cycle of removal and immediate relisting by the same sellers is deeply frustrating. The lack of consequences for these repeat infringers renders the reporting process ineffective. It appears that Temu's current approach inadvertently facilitates intellectual property theft, allowing sellers to act with impunity.I will persist in sharing my experiences with Temu until they take definitive action to remove and prevent the re-listing of my registered designs.For Temu customers, exercise caution as the images on the platform may be stolen from other small businesses. The product you receive may not match the image displayed. This concern is echoed by numerous low-star reviews on Trustpilot citing 'poor quality' or 'items not resembling photos,' likely a result of sellers stealing listing photographs. To identify potential image theft, scrutinise the seller's shop photos; if they display different styles, there's a likelihood of theft. Conduct a reverse image search to locate the original designer. Stay informed to ensure a reliable and ethical shopping experience.EDIT:  the reply to this review sums up TEMU?€?.I am not a TEMU customer and will never be!!!",1,06/09/2023
"Spent almost $600 and got a $5 coupon. ????????????????????.Ordered a few times with them, plastic items, digital, electrical etc, are all NOT worth it.

Fishland is a joke. Been on it every day,multiple times and for some reason i had almost 800 fish food with 7cents left to go?€?.. and it didn?€?t bring it down 1 penny.

"I purchased several items on December 4th. On December 20th I received the parcel with 1 item missing. This item was half the value of my overall order.I reported to them on the live chat and they automatically issued a 'reshipment'. This implied they were reshipping something they already had shipped but never, ever sent me. Expected delivery went from December 22nd to January 7th.They advertise an automatic credit of ??5 within 48 hours if your order is late. Because they say, they issued a reshipment, the late date is pushed out to the new delivery date. So, I ordered December 4th and my late date is now January 7th as opposed to December 22nd. They left out a crucial part of my order but I do not qualify for the compensation because they reshipped it. So.. someone who receives their item 1 day late let's say qualifies but someone like me who needs a whole new shipment and is delayed by several weeks doesn't? Not quite right. Aliexpress in future.As you can see from their reply. They don?€?t listen to the problem you have. So you cant  realistically expect any type of customer service.",1,06/09/2023

The items are pretty good quality sometimes even better than the stuff you buy from physical retailers. I love how they have free shipping for orders of $10 or more. They understand that not everyone can afford the outrageous shipping fees that some of these companies charge. The clothes are nice and decent quality. I've gotten eyeglass kits, chargers, pedicure and manicure kits, kitchen gadgets and so many things that you would need for everyday life. I dont mind spending money shopping on Temu because I know at the end of the day I will be satisfied. Sometimes items do come defective but that's not often and they are willing to refund if needed although I never requested one. Shipping is fast and I actually get my merchandise unlike big online brands. Its like an online flea market.",5,07/09/2023
"My partner purchased some warm gloves and boots on Temu, quality and comfort of boots weren't good.1 MONTH LATER SCAM: Someone trying to use her bank account to buy items outside of the UK. Bank told us that her details were snatched from her Temu purchases and its really common. Be aware, purchasing on Temu opens up chances for scammers to grab your bank details.",1,07/09/2023
"Could not get a REFUND for something I did not order. I could not even get credit for it, so I lost around $53.00 for something I did not even order. It was ALL JUNK I never saw in my life. :(",1,07/09/2023
Cheap Chinese garbage made by slave labor is all you will get from this company.,1,07/09/2023
Ordered a sweater and a few little things and all very poor quality or broken and valued at the $60 range. Sent it back all in original bags but the 2 dog blankets which were $4 each for a refund. They don?€?t refund your credit card back they give me a credit with them. I ask for them to refund my credit card back and nothing back from them. I will never purchase from them again. Temu is a totally rip off and very bad customer service.,1,07/09/2023
"The current PFLogistics as delivery company for Temu is really bad! The driver kept delivering my parcel to my neighbor's house that is under same street number but totally two different streets! I emailed their customer services multiple times regarding this issue, they just ignored my complaints and kept sending to my neighbor's house photo as proof of delivery. I'd have to stop buying from Temu because of this irresponsible delivery company!!!",1,07/09/2023

Ordered a few stocking fillers from Temu at the end of November. It was due mid December. Email communication and tracking service was great. Everything arrived as it should and at the earlier end of the estimated delivery time. I will definitely use them again.,5,07/09/2023
Most disappointed when my order arrived. Ordered 19 items all of them from cheap nylon crap material. Not at all what pictures look like! Waiting to send all back! Seriously how can you sell that crap and your photos misleading also does not tell what type material it?€?s made of. Jewelry broken.!!,1,07/09/2023
"I?€?ve been enjoying shopping with them first until refund problem happened. Twice! I had 2 separate orders that I needed to return partially from each orders. They asked me to combine postage. So I put them all together in one package and sent it back. I received refund only for one of the orders. I complained to customer service and they said their warehouse couldn?€?t locate the other order! Why? I put them all together! I had to send few emails to get my refund. I should have stopped shopping with them when this happened but since Christmas is coming, I decided to give them another chance and bought stocking fillers. I ended up placing 2 separated orders again. One of their problems is the pictures especially clothing. The anctual clothings are different from the first picture they provide on the website. They use the photos from the shopping magazines. Sometimes good copies from good skilled factories but most of them are crap! Nothing like the picture. So most of my returns were clothing before. Back to my story of recent return, I received 2 emails and both of them saying the warehouse had received my packages and I received the refund for one of them. But the other return was declined! I again had to contact the customer service and to my surprise they said I didn?€?t return items properly and put a couple of personal belongings in it! To swear to my kid?€?s life, I DID NOT DO THAT!!! I bet THE WAREHOUSE MIXED UP WITH SOMEONE ELSE?€?S ORDER or THEY ARE LYING AS THEY DO NOT WANT TO REFUND ME. I was quite angry and escalated this to higher up as the customer service agent who was talking to me gave me a referral ticket. No, this ?€?higher investigation?€? is absolutely useless too. All the reply is ?€?the warehouse couldn?€?t find the items and they found my personal belongings?€? such as exactly same reply. Again, I DID NOT DO THAT! Their word against mine, now they even don?€?t send the reply to my last email for a couple of days. I am so shocked as I feel like they betrayed me after I have been using them for a long time. Even my local delivery man says ?€?A parcel for you from Temu!?€? and I was telling him how good Temu was. No, I was wrong! Temu is a scam. I?€?ve learned my lessons from 2 bad experiences and lost ??20, which is not expensive but I spent hundreds of pounds with them. I will delete my account and Temu app.I think they need to investigate their own warehouse. Don?€?t buy from them unless you decide to keep products to yourselves.Addition: Now I can see Temu replied to this feedback but not mentioning about my main problem at all!I am honestly fed up with this copy and paste standard reply to customer?€?s complaints.I paid, they sent me the items, I returned them back, they got the return items but no refund by accusing me I sent not correct ones! Good bye forever Temu! Thanks for the disappointment and keeping all the products and money! I?€?m going to delete my account right now.Update: I couldn?€?t find anywhere on my account to close or delete account. So I asked the customer service agent to close my account. Then he told me to be patient as my case is still open and they are investigating. Then I received an email which was exactly same as before, they investigated warehouse and blah blah blah same story. I know I?€?m not lying so there is some dodgy thing going on in the warehouse. I am wasting my time, honestly. Great! They received all returns, accusing me for faulse return and no refund. They took my money. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TEMU AT ALL.Final update: I could manage to delete my account permanently by signing in Temu?€?s website.",1,07/09/2023
Shipping is horrendous and customer service is even worse. If you expect assistant just know you will get generated message which are exactly the same each time you call. The other excuse they give you is that oh ontrac must be overwhelmed smh ITS THEIR JOB@temu this still doesn?€?t resolve my issue I have contacted yall for over a week about this order with no help at all. It?€?s Christmas and my grandkids present aren?€?t here.,1,07/09/2023
"I am the owner of Glory Tress Wigs on Etsy, and I am compelled to express my disappointment and concern about a serious matter of copyright and trademark infringement involving Temu. It has come to my attention that Temu is running ads claiming to sell my wigs at a 90% discount.This unauthorized use of my brand name not only misleads customers but also poses a significant threat to the reputation of my small business. Additionally, this situation constitutes trademark infringement.I kindly urge Temu to promptly remove all ads referencing the sale of Glory Tress Wigs at a discounted rate and to cease the unauthorized use of my trademark.Failure to address this issue within a reasonable timeframe will leave me with no choice but to pursue legal action. It is disheartening to see a company engaging in such practices, especially when targeting smaller businesses.I hope for a swift resolution to this matter.",1,08/09/2023

Where everyone pass by can steal if they saw it. Becose it not the safe place. Then he delivered on 2:25 am the time everyone is sleeping. He not even call or msg me inform about this thing. He just put the package then took pictures. Dont know after that take my package back to his car or not. Contact the temu and they not responsible with my order. Never ever online shopping with them anymore,1,08/09/2023
Do Not buy from this company sent items for refund still for waiting for the money to come back into my account also one item they are saying they didn't receive however ever thing was inside the returns bag and i have proof on video to show what was sent back. customer service is awful and will not refund the item.

DO NOT SHOP ON THIS SITE It's just cheap knock offs produced in china you cannot be secure on any device they have access to your contacts and photos  the items are photo shopped to look genuine and quality itemsIf you return an item and use temu credit to replace the item you can not recoup the amount paid if the second item is as bad quality as the first  they do not acknowledge the original payment method so you can only use the credit to order more cheap chinese knock offs and give them more access to your private information and your friends details AVOID AVOID AVOIDIf you try to contact customer service all you get is a generated identical reply to you questions and requests saying you can only use credit they don't refund as they don't recognise the original cash payment method,1,08/09/2023
"Still havent received my package! Even contacted their support system & was told that they dont hve any contact information for their own courier service, so no way of contacting them or tracking my package. Ridiculous! No christmas present for my family this year.",1,08/09/2023
"Well ordered $100.00 worth of Christmas gifts. Items were shipped in two seperate packages. Both arrived at customs in USA one ( package1 ) arrive day later from package2. P1 was cleared first and shipped usps and received it in a timely manner. P2 cleared a day later and sat in the airport for 5+days without movement. Neither the carrier (ontrac) or temu will pick up the package and playing games putting the responsibility on the other. So the most valuable package is sitting and missing. Neither temu or ontrac know anything about the missing package only to say it was cleared on the 17th of Dec.i have fought with customer service about this and were no help. They give you the same emails and msgs over and over like they copy and paste the words. I still never got the package and never moved from customs or the airport. Temu is selling counterfeit and fake products from china. Be very aware of this. Company is making millions selling fake and counterfeit items.. Never did get the location of the package nobody picked it up and they both put blame on the other and truly forget the customer. The items i did recieve were crap and ended up throwing 3 of the 7 items out because they were that bad. The other 4 are pretty much rags. They smell horrible and quality is awful. They should not be allowed to bring in fake counterfeit items or products to our country. Finally filed a complaint with FTC. Whether anything happens, its on record for fake and counterfeit products and poor business practice. You have to get really angry at these people to get anything figured out especially if they lost your order. Anyone who orders from temu need to hold them accountable for their faults. Stand up and dont take crap from them. Even better dont buy from them. I wont have christmas this yr because they failed to get my order to me. Just stay away and keep moving on. Dont buy and give them anymore reason to flood the great USA with fake china product. There is a reason temu is cheap. Its all Chinese counterfeit and fake. Please take my review seriously. I warn you!!!!",1,09/09/2023
"Always have a good experience with Temu. I've returned a few things and have had very fast refunds - most before I even ship or not requiring a return. I always get a price change refund too. It takes longer than Amazon, but never more than a few weeks. Quality is great for most products, and easy returns if they aren't. Huge variety of items for sale. I've also had a lot of freebies from their various games/programmes.",5,09/09/2023
I have been monitoring TEMU for some weeks now buying products of different variations and I have to say I am horrified and suspect that a lot of these positive reviews if not all are fake and provided  buy third party means on multiple occasions I did not receive my items and given a multitude of different excuses and lies not to mention the financial loss for my sake and that of others I'm going to use my findings and hand over copies to various organisations. In response to your email I will not disclose any further. but to do as per my previous review if you have done nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about please do not phone with the number you requested I had no choice but to provide.and as I stayed if not heard from in three days you will remove the review that's fine I've screen shot everything someone removing a review in my humble opinion has something to hide you picked on the wrong one Regards.how many times it's legal action I'm taking I've no further comments to make,1,09/09/2023
"I am addicted! Literally everything I can imagine is on this site. From trending items to parts for my RV! Quality materials and low prices got me hooked line and sinker. I have ordered from Temu multiple times. If the price goes down for any item, they refund the difference. I am definitely a happy camper!",5,09/09/2023
"Good customer serviceI've had several Temu orders now.  Almost all have arrived within a week.  One was not scanned by the couriers for many days, and Temu refunded it quickly (and, in fact, it did turn up - and was delivered within the original time frame quote!)Quality can be difficult to judge from the pictures on screen.  A couple of things haven't been good quality, but have been acceptable for the price.  For clothing I now opt for items clearly described as 100% cotton only.  Sizing is tricky to gauge so I tend to order a bit bigger than I think I need.   Most things have been very good quality.Delivery is dependent on the local courier.  The current EVRI lady is very good, but in the past I would actively avoid companies using HERMES/EVRI.  Temu do offer a parcel shop pick up option though, which I have also tried successfully.",5,09/09/2023

SCAMTemu is a complete scam. I ordered a gift for my father in Ireland and the website says that it was delivered and a signature obtained however it wasn?€?t delivered at all. When I try to call the ?€?courier?€? company as suggested on the website the number isn?€?t even connected. There?€?s no way for me to contact Temu because they have disabled their online chat and their email is a ?€?no-reply?€? email. They have just stolen over $50 from me!! I will be reporting them to the ACCC and I have lodged a payment dispute with PayPal. There is no way they are getting away with this. Please don?€?t use Temu unless you want to be scammed!!! They?€?re not a legit company.,1,09/09/2023

I ordered a wig and when it arrived the wrong colour and style wig was inside the package. Within 5 minutes of the item being delivered I opened a case with Temu with evidence the incorrect item was inside the package. After being passed around for 4 days they said they won't refund as they have checked their evidence and the correct item was inside the package. They completely ignored that I sent a picture of the wig inside the package 5 minutes after receiving it and refuse to provide me with the evidence they have that the correct wig was posted. Somehow they can't see the clear evidence I provided of the WRONG colour wig. It's like they pick and choose what they want to refund and just ignore what the customer says.

Even though their prices are amazing, they give you opportunities to save even more, via vouchers, sales, etc. Their returns procedure is made simple.

Have bought a lovely jumpsuit, technology and cosmetic items, and kitchen stuff.  Razor blades for my husband that look and are the same quality as the leading brand.  Got great black gel eyeliner better quality than my leading brand I had been buying, and lovely lip liner pens.   The make up is good quality for a great price.

"Compared with Aliexpress this site has higher prices most of the time but expedition is free for all goods above ???10 - which is perfectly reasonable - and the shipping is within 15 days not 80 days. Usually less than 2 weeks and when it late they offer ???5 in rebate.Some goods are the same sold also on Amazon but on Amazon the expedition is with 24h or 48h and usually the price is quite higher, sometimes just 10% on some costly goods.On Temu, recently, the reviews started to be meaningful. When I started to buy on this site they have in place a strong policy to ""bribe"" the customer to leave 4* or 5* review but now, they got that it is against their interest in doing that. Poor quality items are quickly removed from their selling catalog.Improvements? At the moment, many different e-vendors associated with Temu offers the same identical item but the review of the same item among vendors are not put in common. Also Amazon does not do that in all circumstances. The reason? Sometimes bad ratings from customers are not about the item itself but because how the item is advertised. On Amazon they addressed this giving a large description text but on Temu just the title exists.Temu, e-bay, Aliexpress and Amazon are going to fit different buying needs and models. Everyone of this has their advantages.At the moment, Aliexpress is the only one that does not deserve 5* as a service because they have to improve the buying experience much more and then they can compete with Temu on delivering cheaper prices for large volumes: 1-4 pieces in 15gg -> Temu, 5 or above -> Aliexpress in 80gg.",5,11/09/2023
Temu has everything!  I have only had amazing experiences with them.  They have excellent customer service.  The app is great!  The purchase process and return process are without any problem.  Before you buy on Amazon check Temu because you can get it for half the price.,5,11/09/2023
"Temu Where do I start this ???? I placed a large order of ??300.59 pounds I had a notice of the order the site flashed red deceptive site.I felt uneasy from a security point, I contacted paypal about this as I paid through them .They ask do I want to issue a chargeback yes replied.This in its self cause so much stress they entered the wrong reason for the charge back.I emailed them informing them of this, but the reason of the chargeback was order not received.On my case details this remained.Several calls later to nowhere 1 agent informed  me I wasn't in fact covered under paypals terms and conditions. My reply why have you opened the claim????I said I would end the call at this point.I called back to take this up with I hoped a different agent.She informed  me I was infact covered I bought up the issue of the reason for return not being correct.She at paypal informed me they can only enter order not received or not as described. I informed this is not the legal reason!!!!!I was assured via PayPal that by the 5th of December if they hadn't response the case would be closed in my favour.Then the 8th, then the 10th then the 14th of December.I was escalated to the finance section at paypal now wait for it , 5 hours later and a promise of a conformation email I was assured it would be closed in my favour on the 14th.That email never arrived!!!!I look in my resolution case account only to find they had moved the dates.The 18th of December to the first of January. I wrote to their London office pages of this case.I received a reply a week on.Please send us further information I did wouldn't send.I tried later a red ticket came up saying this email has been changed.And it's no longer active, so how can they send a email that doesn't exist???? I trailed to find another and explained the situation a notice flagged up you can not send this email what's going on here???????I came to check paypal on trustpilot as I do for most things only to find so many problems and could relate to my own it was scary.I contacted temu to inform them of the situation and asked if I close the case to nowhere could they refund me They replied of course we will help you.I sent the proof to them I also closed my 11 years of service to paypal. I have been given automated divulge of numerous repeated emails saying ups high priority and within 24 hours I will get my refund.A week later and on constant chat I have no money they have the goods some 3 weeks they have my money..They have a computerised system where a name pops up promising how they will help you dear.Repeat repeat repeat I have informed they are acting illegally and have the goods plus ??300.59 pounds of my ???? money I hope you temu read and respond to this and refund my money you are acting illegally and action with the orthorities will be in formed  of your business ethics.Which are appalling and disgusting.

Poor quality sizes are wrong.Spent ??118 and will have to throw everything out. Rugs are cheap looking and very thin.Obviously their reviews are bought or in house.Do not buy rugs or curtains. Black out? Throw out,2,11/09/2023
Very much disappointed. They do not have solutions for their customers in case of lost packages by fraud delivery companies. They tie up with fraud companies without seeing their reviews. Fraud company like straightship. There is no point of getting the refund whereas we wait for so long to get the product for special occasions or urgent but you guys provide only refund.and that way you are spoiling the plans of your customers.  Instead of refund you guys should send the same products with express shipping to deliver a satisfactory results to your customers,1,11/09/2023
"I must admit I did research before purchasing and was still skeptical of using the sight, so I only purchased 18 dollars worth of stuff and used Pay Pal to pay.

"I made a purchase for the first, and last, time on Temu.Purchased two bedside alarm clock lights with a variety of features including lighting modes and ?€?sunrise?€? light simulation amongst other claims. The instructions were a sheet of paper that only covered a small amount. So no alarm clock and the only way to alter the lights was press a button. As the alarm was the main feature required the items were useless. Temu customer services chat whilst friendly kept referring back to the ?€?Manual?€? which was the brief instructions in the box. I tried everything including pairing the phone thinking that would help. However nothing, other than iTunes, would Bluetooth to the device. Returns and refund depend on the item getting back safely and them checking. The items arrived wrapped in a plastic bag and miraculously were undamaged. I have no confidence in the return!",1,12/09/2023
"I've never had such a poor customer service experience, Wahyudi literally trolled instead of attempting to provide any assistance whatsoever. The first agent I chatted with was fine albeit didn't do enough to help where they could have but Wahyudi started spamming automated messages when asked to not send them, including a rating section, just deliberately goading. I've never known anyone to act like this before. Temu don't seem to care about the customer experience when they hire people like Wahyudi.I'm still left with my issue and no idea if or when it will be resolved because the agent decided to troll rather than do their job.",1,12/09/2023

"I don't shop at Temu regularly, but we saw some brick sets that would be perfect presents and we couldn't find them elsewhere. So we placed a couple of orders for a number of brick models. They do take a while to be delivered, but we ordered so there was time to get them before Christmas. They were also split up into different parcels so parts of orders came at different times. However, we were disappointed when they arrived as they were all packaged in bags and the majority of the boxes were damaged and dented, especially in one order. I contacted customer service and was told that I could return them for a refund and then order replacements. However, I couldn't guarantee that the replacements would arrive in time for Christmas and they were presents. I asked if a 50% partial refund for the damaged boxes was possible, but that isn't an available policy with Temu. I feel really disappointed because it was Temu's decision to package the order in a bag and so Temu's fault that the boxes were damaged. They were meant to be presents and they are not in great condition which is a shame. I feel they need more options for customer service because a 50% refund would have been a fair solution for the situation. We now have to repackage and wrap the items to make them more presentable.",2,13/09/2023

"I finally gave after being targeted by constant ads for a year, and bought a jacket and a hat. They arrived quicker than you'd expect from China. About 8 or 9 days. The jacket was way too small. Supposed to be an XL, which always fit me with room to spare. And the ad said 85% true to size. I left an honest review. It was there for a couple of days then vanished. The reviews, when you read them are pathetically fake. And virtually all 4 and 5 star reviews. They also send you 80% off offers literally daily. But it's basically cheap, mass produced tat, that will have our landfill sites brimming over even faster than they already are. They might appear to have unbelievable bargains, but trust me, it's poor quality and mis-sized.

"I've placed a couple of orders with them now for myself and family and have been happy. It surely depends on what you order but I've bought items that I don't particularly want to spend money on. Realistically I'm not expecting high quality and with that in mind I'm satisfied. I've seen the same items on eBay, Amazon and Shein going for higher prices, although Shein is much more clothing focused, whereas I'm mainly buying items for the house and things like that. I've also bought stationery for kids who are not going to appreciate more expensive alternatives and there're some cute ""kawaii"" items available for them. The website is fun to use. You can spend hours trawling. I don't have the app, just because I'm more comfortable shopping on my laptop. Delivery is faster than expected (6 days).",5,14/09/2023

If not, you get a credit for the delay that you can use at your next purchase (which of course means you will have to make a new purchase...)What I didn't like, but I don't know how much this is about Temu and how much about Paypal, is that after my first purchase with Temu through Paypal, Temu established itself as a vendor with automatic payment. I did not know about it, but realized this was the case at my next purchase with Temu when Paypal did not require authentification for the transaction. When I checked with Paypal, it turned out this was because it was categorized as automatic, which was not my decision. I don't like this kind of business strategy.",4,14/09/2023

This is a total scam company they told me I had a free gift but then said I needed to buy 7 items to get it. This I wouldn't have minded as nothing in life is free but they advertised it was with no strings. This will be removed as I will be asked for proof of purchase but I didn't buy anything as this company should not be trading avoid at all costs,1,14/09/2023
place my order and paid for it. but they shipped the wrong size. tried to return to get reimbursed never got anything back! I will never buy from them again it is one thing to sell and ship but if you make a mistake and do not reimburse it does not work! and no communication.!,1,15/09/2023
"The sizes of the tee shirts and clothes were spot on, old sizing, a small mens is a small mens. The delivery was much quicker (from overseas) than buying from some Australian manufacturers. They kept me up-to date with the whole sale process and the delivery.",4,15/09/2023

Had terrible experience with buying from them out of two packages one of got to me and the other never got delivered and when I asked for refund they said contact evri the delivery compnay and obviously I would not because I bought from temu. Their product are cheap and bin worthy. Please don't buy from them as they are a scam and take your money and not provide you the stuff you have paid for.,1,15/09/2023
First time ordering as I was dubious but my items came in good time plus they looked exactly like the photos on their site. The tracking service was also great. I didn't pay a lot for the goods but the quality was much better than I expected.,5,15/09/2023

"Mixed experience. Overall, quality of items just doesn't live up to the descriptions and photos on their website or app. I understand they are cheaper than most sources, but that doesn't negate the blatant false advertising of the products you are paying for.

Update on review below. I have placed orders with the actual TEMU site since and am totally pleased with the products and service.  Below original comments were based on a scam by a copycat as advised by TEMU. I contacted my bank and was reimbursed for the purchase I never received. My error to trust pop up links and not going directly to the website. My apology to TEMU.I placed a order on Sept 30/23.  Payment went through on Oct 03/23.  Knowing delivery could take some time and receiving an email with a tracking number I thought all was good.  Apparently the order made it to Canada Oct 21/23.  It all stopped there and I have received nothing.  After multiple emails I was given a number to call Canada Post.  I did call but they could not help me other than the tracking number doesn't exist as none end in YP which mine did.  More emails sent but with no luck and now my email was returned stating  .. Host unknown (Name server: teghper.com: host not found).,1,15/09/2023
"I am done with Temu. 3 out of 3 orders:  Problems using my credit card (they actually asked for a copy of my statement to ""verify"" - VERY sketchy), problems with an item that didn't work, problems with shipping, problems with receiving items.  Chat representatives can't do anything to help but give useless credits or refunds for items I should have received and just cover scripted talking points.  I like most of the things I've received - if/when I receive them.  Maybe instead of suing their competitors Temu should focus on their own order fulfillment failures.",2,15/09/2023
Prices are great...products not so great.  packaging stinks.  stuff comes in  from China often damaged...bent.  they need to improve how they package and ship the products.  it is more hassle to  repackage and then returen  easier to throw away,1,15/09/2023
"This company should hang their heads in shame. I have used them a few times & found all ok. But, I haven't ordered from them for almost 2 years, as been very ill. I placed an order a few weeks ago, paid with paypal immedoately. They rejected my order, still waiting for refund. I deleted their app, so they had the nerve to use my no to harass me into buying on whatsapp. Up to 8 msgs daily. They should not be allowed to p m customers. Made official report, will report Director in the morning",1,15/09/2023

"I didn't receive my purchase or lost it. I tried to communicate with Temu customer service but they didn't resolve my problem. They just tried to delay the solving process first then they refused to solve the problem. Their customer service sucks and can not compete with such as Amazon, etc. Be aware of buying expensive items ( don't buy more than 20$) with them, if something happens they will refuse to solve the problem.",1,15/09/2023

"Until last night, I've been a recent convert to Temu. Goods were delivered faster than stuff I've ordered in my own country and were pretty much as descrided. One item was delivered damaged and it was no trouble to have the item credited.However last night I noticed an unauthorised amount of money taken from my account. When I rang my bank to query it, I was asked if I had recently downloaded an app or....yes, I said I downloaded the Temu app. She advised me to delete the app as a number of the banks customers had had the same thing happen to them. When I checked the reference on the debit, it was plain to see that it was a scam site. I'm not saying it was Temu because God knows they are making money hand over fist but the app itself is NOT SECURE.",1,16/09/2023

"I was sceptical at first so did a trial order. I have since probably spent over ??400 on orders. They do a great job and basically is a Chinese Amazon. I have had the same items from Temu that friends have paid 3 times for on Amazon. If and when there is any problems Temu sorts within hours. Carry on the good work. It is the same with companies who supply lots of items...there's always going to be one or two disgruntled customers.......One tip though..is...check the measurements and reviews before making a purchase, then you are aware of what you buy. 6 days delivery on average",5,16/09/2023
"I?€?ve never had an issue with temu! I used to order from Ali express (slow!) or SHEIN for cheap products, who used to give pretty fast shipping (5-10 total days, not business days, so you?€?d have it within the week usually), however shein had became a LOT slower for some items (my latest order took 3 weeks and two days).I was really resistant to trying TEMU as people seemed to be trying to recruit me, almost like an MLM, so that they could level up and get cheaper deals - which is off putting. It seemed suspicious initially and I didn?€?t want to get involved in MLM-like businesses. However, for Christmas this year I decided to give it a go because of the cheap prices that were similar to Ali express (whose postage is very slow). May I just say I was pleasantly surprised! I?€?ve now made three orders. Order one came within a week, two came in just under two weeks, and three came in a week and one day (not business days, calendar weeks). The products were all pretty solid considering how cheap they are! (They?€?re never going to be luxury, but they all work perfectly and look nice!) There are deals that mean that if you refer a lot of friends in, you get cheap products and discounts?€? but I just ignore them.As a business, it has actually been excellent and I?€?m sorry I didn?€?t try it before! The website and app are easy to use with great features. The products are great. The delivery was good?€? The experience has been great. so now?€? despite being so anti-Temu originally?€?

Sorry, but other reviews are not very positive.Too small.Bad quality etc.So I haven?€?t even tried & never will.Same for shoes.",4,16/09/2023
"I think Temu should be used for what it is: a collection of cheap Chinese products.the App: I can never find the advertised prices or offers on internet. Also, the overabundance of similar items from different sellers is hard to oversee.the marketplace: while many sellers add a lot of pictures, you have to be careful when choosing items as initial pictures often do not represent the different options. I've been caught out on this too, items having been misrepresented in size.the shipping: be prepared to wait up to 2 weeks for items to arrive. Most frustrating: items arrive in a bag, and I have received several items damaged as a result.none the less, I don't expect to return items, just buy enough crap and most of it will serve some purpose or other.",3,16/09/2023
"Up till now, Temu has not refunded my money for returned items. The worst company ever",1,16/09/2023
I was very skeptical after reading all the reviews but I decided to give it a shot. My order thankfully arrived and it arrived early too,5,16/09/2023
"Temu.com offers a mix of experiences with its products. While many items are surprisingly good for their price, some, like a $15 dress, can be of poor quality, exhibiting issues like undone stitching and loose threads. Temu's return policy is notably generous, offering easy and quick refunds, even allowing customers to keep returned items in some cases. However, product quality varies as Temu is a marketplace for various vendors. Clothing sizes are generally true to size, but it's important to know your measurements due to varying sizing standards. Some products can be knock-offs as well. For instance a fastener set for your automobile is advertised as a name brand stainless steel set, but rusts easily in the weather.",4,16/09/2023
"I have never contacted this company, yet I am being bombarded with emails which I can't block as they appear to come from google.I have now spoken to the team as requested, but I'm still getting emails.

Two tops were grey, one a blue print and one a pink print.  They?€?ve NOT been replaced yet my order for the amount of nearly $40 was submitted.

"Totally rubbish. Cheap mass produced products at knock down prices.  Aggressive marketing emails once you open an account. I ordered three products but although I did receive them they were all substandard. One, a jacket I put straight into a charity box.  I closed the account after that as couldn?€?t be bothered to clutter up my phone with a site that continually tries to get you to buy more rubbish. I wonder how much people are being paid to produce all this tat. The world doesn?€?t need it,Further to my review- Since Temu have responded to my review I have been asked to prove my dealings with the company are genuine by providing for example a receipt. As I said in my review I have closed my account and so therefore cannot provide proof. I have replied to this effect. I am an honest person and would not go to the lengths of providing a review if it were not a genuine experience.EDIT:I have now managed to get my review verified by Trustpilot not without some tooing and froing of emails. Anyone reading this will now see this is a genuine review and not something I made up. My concern with Temu is that we do not need all this cheap mass produced stuff. The world is struggling to survive already without our contributing further to waste and landfill. Be responsible people and don?€?t buy tat please.",1,17/09/2023

"I guess I'm used to being insulted by advertisements where women are pictured looking like prostitutes, but why put a distorted picture of a mentally handicapped child in your ad?  Which part of the buying public is Temu aiming at with that?  I won't buy from a merchant that has so little such respect for its customers and people in general.  Later:  Temu responded to my above review by saying that the ad I saw was ""out of the norm"".  Strange.  I've seen the ad pretty much every day for the last several months.  So - what is considered 'the norm'?  I'm driven to cynicism.J. C. Penney founded his store in 1902 with one simple rule ?€? to treat others as they would like to be treated. The Golden Rule was the name of his first store.  Wise customers don't buy from companies that treat ANYONE with the disrespect Temu shows in its advertising.   What respect will a customer get when asking for a refund?",1,17/09/2023

My items did not come on dates that were said they would. They came on different days and I was sent doubles of just about everything I ordered.The discount was wonderful and really it doesn't bother me that they came on wrong dates. I got 2 pairs of sandals different colors and they were soooooo much cheaper and of goooood quality. Will buy more.,4,17/09/2023

Each order has been delivered within the designated time frame and usually in good condition.Some of the items I?€?ve not been happy with as they have not been as described/have been poor quality or have been damaged but they have been great at refunding me quickly as a credit note off my next purchase and have said I can keep the items.I don?€?t think I would use them for big or expensive items due to their packing not being very protected (basic white plastic bag/no padding) but I?€?ve found them very good for costume jewellery, crafty items, false nails and stickers etc.My only niggle is that they use Evri ( was Hermes) for their deliveries and my local driver is very hit and miss as to where he leaves your parcels.As the postage is free though over a ??10 order I guess you cannot complain.",4,17/09/2023
"Absolutely great site, lots to choose from. Great prices. Fast delivery. No quibble refunds. I highly recommend. I have been shopping on here for months.",5,17/09/2023
Not impressed by Temu at all. The items they sent to me are miniature sized whereas the pictures they show customers on their website are the pictures of  the standard sized ones. By mere sleight of hand they are fleecing customers of their money. I'm not surprised they are Chinese because another Chinese online company named Gogogadgets had sold me useless ecoheaters of extremely poor quality at a ridiculous high price. Can't a regulatory agency step in and remove them from the market?,1,17/09/2023
"TEMU.com is my new personal favorite site to shop for useful things as they have ?€?em at Amazon. But vs competitor Amazon, Temu is by far has the BEST prices with just as good of a quality if not better. If you are a 1st time customer the site will give you crazy amazing good deal promotional offer (so use my advice and pick something exclusive because say for total of $200 it?€?ll give you a deal you wouldn?€?t want to refuse & end up paying like $50). The rest of the offers/promotions sort of accumulate over time and you may not get that deal of a century, but still receive good offers along the way. The 1st time order usually takes 2 weeks + 2-3 days to process because occasionally (especially during a holiday) items tend to go out of stock, super fast. The Temu headquarters are located in China so they ship or fly their items overseas. The packages ALWAYS arrive re-bound with scotch tape, but that?€?s because they undergo through USA customs. They open and check ea/package even a tiny item. Then they bound the original plastic packaging with wide tape and ship it out to US location. The further orders usually arrive faster as I noticed, within 7-10 business days or so. I suppose it all depends on the location of the warehouse of your items. I personally recommend this website for all purchases needed for household, kitchen, toys and other. They have very easy return options and refund pretty much immediately which you can use as credit towards next purchases. I personally never had to return anything but my husband did and he said it?€?s super easy. You can only leave reviews if you made a purchase via website because it?€?ll take you to certain order page and lead you to provide feedback with/without photo of the item. To have an idea of price difference Amazon vs Temu check out trending gift ideas for smartphone camera lenses set (the kind you attach to your phone camera to make wide angle photos, fish eye effect, macro closeup capture, CPL color filter, kaleidoscope & whatever other). Let?€?s say a kit of 9 items at Amazon would cost $30. While at Temu that same set will be 1/2 price if not less. I also noticed how items of numerous possibilities keep on adding up to the site during each new season. So it?€?s not like you?€?re gonna be stuck with certain verity, no there will be a ton of versions to choose from. Love this site & highly recommend! Check them out on YouTube. Temu also has something such as become an Affiliate or Influencer on Temu to get free stuff when you  test out their promotional products and leave reviews. It?€?s kinda time consuming but still. They offer $ for it. Check it out definitely!!!",5,18/09/2023
"The fantastic service from Temu is mind blowing. I have ordered lots from them and they have been late only twice by one day and even then it was the courier not Temu. In three cases I have been paid the penalty for the delay despite one actually being on time.You have to read all the information and check sizes before ordering. If it is really cheap you cannot expect perfection. In most cases the quality is excellent.Every time I requested a refund, not required a lot, there has been no issue. It has been paid immediately. I just print off a label and take it to the post office at no cost to me.In one case I had a problem finding something and they helped me out with quick replies. It is not always easy to get through to them because robots can never be that effective, but you can get through eventually which is important.",5,18/09/2023

"Cheap and, generally, cheerful.  They manage to provide fairly reasonable stuff for a very good price.  Occasionally, an item is faulty and is refunded instantly as a credit, which of course keeps you tied in.  The packing of deliveries is not wonderful, just tightly wrapped plastic bags.One major concern is around the security of my data.

"I spent a good amount of money on a recent haul I did from Temu, and they kept telling me my package was delivered but I didn?€?t receive anything! I reached out to customer service and all they did was tell me to check my surrounding areas, which I already did. No replacement, no refund?€? I am so shocked at this customer service. What a waste of time and money. Stay away from this company - Temu seems like a scam, and at the very least, they don?€?t appear to care about their customers at all. Horrible experience. Don?€?t waste your time?€?UPDATE: I messaged Temu?€?s customer service again and asked about the Temu Protection Policy, and they offered me no solution, no refund, no reshipment. Just nothing.

"Visiting Temu for the first time this morning, first impressions...speedy page-hopping was as nothing I've ever come across before, inviting a fast and fun-filled window-shopping experience, and with adverts popping up throughout in the showcasing of seemingly endless offers it appears that the customer is virtually guaranteed prices which cannot be beaten elsewhere.Looking at the location of Temu, the business is located in the U.S whilst shipping its products from China but which should come as no surprise because most retailers do the same. There are scamming sites to be wary of; Temu, however, is a legitimate Chinese-owned company (though not accredited by the BBB and a missing factor which PDD Holdings may wish to change), launching a campaign at a Super Bowl only this year.In short, as long as Temu can keep to a standard of production as pleasing as their website then there is really no reason to ever look back.",4,19/09/2023

"BEWARE OF TEMUI placed an order that was split into 2 packages.   Part 2 of my order I didn?€?t receive .  Evri left it outside my door and it went missing.   I live  where it?€?s a main walk through for the main shopping area.   I never gave my permission to have any packages left as there are no safe places to leave anything.  As there tracked you would expect they need a photo or signature.   Then they suggested Royal Mail to deliver any other orders in the future.   Once again part 2 of an order I didn?€?t receive.   It was on the tracking information as delivered to a safe place .   Royal  Mails terms and conditions of delivery are two attempts to deliver after then your packages are then taken back and a card is left for you to collect them  from Royal mails delivery office .   I had no card left to say where this delivered package was left or any photo available to see where this package was.   TEMU refused to refund this missing package.   I have sent multiple emails but they still have refused.  I asked them for proof of delivery to justify refusal of a refund.   just kept saying it was delivered so we won?€?t be giving a refund.I have pointed out I purchased and payed for goods I never received, also TEMU has the contract  with Royal Mail for delivery not myself. Do not purchase anything from Temu if your package goes missing the will not refund your money. Royal Mail failed as they did not follow terms and conditions and the suppler is responsible for there contracts  with the delivery companies. They have now claimed with the second missing package that is there terms and conditions not to refund! They also will argue continuously with any problems. I had an item missing from a package I received and they said they have checked and the item was in the order.  They did eventually refund for the missing item after many emails but not because they believed it was missing! As the items are not purchased directly from Temu it?€?s insulting to claim it wasn?€?t missing as they investigated it wasn?€?t missed from the order.  I have not left reviews but I can say most goods you will get what your paying for.  Beware of clothing as it is nothing like it looks as a advertised.other  items  are very much smaller than they look but you are getting what you paid for.   They added an item  I had previously bought in the same size previously!! I was happy with a few bits but they were stocking fillers.  There prices you pay and what they claim is sale or offer  price you definitely would not pay that amount seeing the items.  Any problems expect many emails and constant contact as they are very difficult to deal with. They will ask multiple times for the same information.  Be very precise as to begin with you are messaging a BOT not a human it will be very frustrating.     These have been my experiences.  When placing any orders I stopped looking at the good reviews and looked the bad low rating ones then would not purchase them items.  Please look at the low ratings as I made this mistake of not doing this to start with. It is not the customer?€?s responsibility to chase the delivery company it?€?s the supplier and I pointed this out also Once it was my orders were going to delivered by Royal Mail because of there terms and conditions I never expected any packages to left without a proof of delivery. Temu have accepted leaving it (safe place ) was   delivered without and photo of where or any card with information as to where. There is absolutely no sense to there refusal to refund with Royal Mail even though terms and conditions were not kept to but refunded a package with a photo of it left outside my property.  They kept sending the same photo of myself with another package being delivered.  Expect many issues and being asked the same question multiple times before you get anywhere with Temu.  I can only think they will refund one missing package but if it happens again for any reason you will not get a refund as this has been my experience.  Multiple times I pointed out I have never agreed to my packages to left as there are no safe places.  One item claims it only needs charging once every few months that?€?s a little sensor light but it is not true it?€?s has to be charging every day to last a few times.  Add the price of this and it?€?s definitely not a bargain.  This review I did leave and I was told I can send it back but for the price of fuel and time it wasn?€?t worth doing it. You can only chance to a free return per order so keep this in mind also when placing an order if your unlucky to receive more than one item for any reason you want to return. I would have still considered purchasing items but definitely looking at low rated reviews! All items boxed were crushed. So don?€?t expect outer packages to be presentable as presents. Stay clear of this company. While you are looking at the goods they constantly send messages that are very irritating with a timer showing counting down time !",1,20/09/2023

"Further edit - Trustpilot - 36% reviews with 1 star if indeed the bad reviews can be found!?!?!?!  Suffice it to say it's not just me then - 36 out of every 100 people agree that Temu is BAD, with many of the 36% suggesting that 1 star is too good!!!!! Credit in three minutes means to Temu for my refund around 50 hours and counting, even though they still say it in their reply to my review!!! Edit - They replied faster than they did for the chat after my one star review, although the chat questions were still not answered!!  Where is my credit, as the TEMU 3 minute rule certainly doesn't apply to my returned item?  Why do buyers have to pay for any returns of faulty items, not as described?  Now they want me to pay ??2.50 for the return of an item very much not as described!!!  My advice stays the same - AVOID, AVOID, AVOID - if not - and your items are faulty, you will pay to send them back, and like me, not receive the credit.  This is this a company boasting good customer service, strict policies and control measures to ensure product quality and accurate product descriptions - sorry but the policies and control measures are sadly lacking!!Edit over - purchase with my comments in mind or suffer the consequences!! Original review below.Avoid TEMU at all cost!!!  They suggest a three minute credit if you choose to return an item - not true!!!  UK sizing is nowhere near, and a farce!!  Customer service is non-existent and they will not answer simple questions!!!  Chat delays are horrendously long and end up pointless and no help!!!!  Returns are only free for one item from an order - faulty product is not my problem, so why should customers pay to send faulty goods back!!!  Product descriptions are to say the least misleading with one product described as ""Heavy Duty Ultra Thick.."" being 0.12mm thick, which is not much more than paper thickness!!!  All in, not good.  Waiting to see if they get my last order delivered and if the product is OK, and then - account closed!!!",1,21/09/2023

"I have made 4 orders from TEMU already. Even though the shipping is a bit slow, I find that I get the same quality from them as I do here in the US. Example: I purchased 3 whopper plopper fishing lures for $8.00 for all three. Here in the states One will cost over $10.00. It's the same item.  The quality is the same simply  because most everything here in the United States comes from China anyway. Temu simply sells directly from the manufacture. I will continue purchasing from TEMU",5,21/09/2023

Should of had be signed for, re-delivered or taken to the post office 2 minutes away, they would not refund, they pay for the cheapest possible delivery where your goods are not safe and no refund offered !My reply to Temu5 weeks I have been in communication with yourselves & has caused so much stress because even your live chat on which I've used for 5 weeks now talking to different people do not even read my messages, they are not wanring to understand what has happened, they just reply saying we can see it has been delivered and show me the photo of the parcel being left on an outside doorstep and then close the case, weeks and weeks I have told Temu I did not receive it, that I was away, it got left out side, my neighbours have not taken it as I've knocked on all the doors! So you escalate my complaint only to ge told it was delivered, show me a photo of it delivered on doorstep  and then close the case ! I have tried so hard with you.Evri the courier said they will not take responsibility either as they told me that you only pay the minimum postage,  no signature needed and that they will not take it to a post office. & now Evri ignore me , and will not get back to me when calling, leaving my details on their automated system.

"I am a Temu customer from Brisbane, Australia, and my criticism is leveled at Temu's freight agents rather than Temu itself. Because their freight agents won't respond to my online queries and cannot be contacted by telephone, I am compelled to warn others about the poor delivery service through this forum. Maybe by doing this, someone will take responsibility for the unsatisfactory delivery service!To put matters in context, I live in a gated complex consisting of 63 townhouses. On Wednesday 06 December, I received a phone call from the Temu courier asking for the PIN for the security gate to my complex. I gave him the PIN and informed him that I would wait at my front door to take possession of my delivery. After about 3 minutes of waiting, the courier did not arrive to deliver my parcel. I went for a walk around the complex looking for the delivery vehicle but it had already left the complex. I tried calling the mobile number of the courier but was asked to enter an extension number (which I did not possess). Several minutes later, I received an automated email from Temu that my parcel had been delivered and ""signed for"". I attempted to contact the delivery company but could only complete an online support ticket. There was no contact telephone number on their website. After completing my online support ticket, I went for another walk around the complex for over 30 minutes looking at the front porch of almost every townhouse for my parcel. Eventually, I found my parcel left unattended on an outdoor table of another townhouse. On this occasion I was lucky but it could have easily turned out for the worse. How could the driver deliver the parcel to the wrong unit when the address label was clearly printed? Furthermore, I had informed the delivery driver that I would be waiting for him at my front door! After retrieving my parcel, I completed another online support ticket to notify the delivery company that I had managed to track down my parcel and explained that their delivery driver had just left my parcel unattended at the wrong address. It has now been over two days since I sent both support tickets but the delivery company has not responded to express an apology for the unprofessional and unacceptable delivery service provided by their driver. For Temu to send me an automated delivery notification stating that the parcel had also been ""signed for"" was a joke! Next time I order from Temu, I will not give the delivery driver the PIN for my gated complex and I will tell him to wait for me at the security gate so I can collect my parcel in person. As a follow-up to the above review, the freight agent finally responded to my support ticket after a whole week. Rather than apologizing for the poor delivery service, they insisted that their driver delivered my parcel to the correct address. They did not provide me with any proof to back up their assertion. I believe it is standard industry practice to take a photograph of a parcel that is delivered and left unattended as proof that the delivery occurred. No such evidence was provided to me so I can only assume that if their driver took a photo it would have proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that he delivered the parcel to the wrong address. That is why the freight agent was unwilling to provide any proof of delivery. I understand that mistakes can happen and I would have accepted a simple apology. The fact that the freight agent refuses to even acknowledge that their delivery driver erred in this instance is just further proof of how unprofessional and deliberately misleading the organization is.",1,22/09/2023
"Dear Warehouse Manager, I am writing to address an issue concerning the handling of my recent order and subsequent refund. I apologize for the lengthy explanation, but I believe it is crucial to address all the discrepancies that have arisen.After multiple discussions and exchanges, a member of your warehouse team has finally located the missing plus-size men's items that I initially reported were not included in my shipment. However, I have not received any communication or apology regarding the mistake made by your personnel.Moreover, I have noticed an error in the refund amount that was issued to me. The original refund should have been ??448.08, as previously agreed upon. However, upon reviewing recent transactions, I observed that only ??225.77 was sent to my PayPal account. Additionally, ??164.83 was seemingly sent in response to my continued complaints, followed by a payment of ??19.70. When I calculated the total of these amounts (19.70 + 164.83 + 225.77), it came to ??410.30. This leaves a discrepancy of ??37.78, as the expected total should have been ??448.08.I kindly request your assistance and immediate attention in rectifying this matter. As an honest individual, I am genuinely upset by these complications and would greatly appreciate a thorough review of the situation. I trust in your commitment to customer satisfaction and seek a prompt resolution.For your reference, the relevant details are as follows:?€?

"I love Temu. I have saved sooooo much money especially on gifts for Christmas. I have also been more than satisfied with the service I received on two little problems I had. It was small damage on  an item on two occasions, I only had to send a photo and my money was refunded. I had the choice to put it onto my Temu account and used it on my next order, no waiting. !!Please keep up the good work and I wont be shopping anywhere else in the future. The only issue I have is I feel sorry for my courier as he is at my door every day, love him. !!!!!!!Wishing everyone at Temu a very happy Christmas.",5,23/09/2023
"ONE BIG BAIT & SWITCH.I'm pretty sure the postive,glowing reviews here on TrustPilot are fake. Notice how many of them say something like ""I'm obsessed with Temu"", etc.These are cheap, CHEAP knock-off, not even worthy of the dollar store, bottom of the barrel items that you could probably do better buying at the 99 cent store.  Temu's products makes ""Momentum"" products (where many 99 cent store products come from) look like they were purchased on Rodeo Drive.It all starts with the misleading photos. The photos they show for items are hugely inaccurate and I think they're hoping you just keep the items instead of returning them.  Scale is off, they don't show close ups of things and they purposefully withhold information so you think you're getting something of higher quality because it *looks* like something familiar, but when it arrives, it's cheap cheap crap.I bought a holiday light set that was supposedly for use outdoors, but it charges with a USB interface and holds NO charge whatsoever, so they say to use a laptop or power bank to power the item. Riiiight. I'm going to put a laptop or powerbank outdoors 24/7 to power this item? I don't think so.I poster we bought was printed on cheap plastic laminated fabric. I thought I was getting canvas. A tree topper I bought comes without any sort of cone to place it on top of the tree... the list of nonsensical problems with the merchandise goes on and on.It's a headache to return this stuff. Do yourself a favor and skip ordering. I don't believe any of the positive reviews are real. No one would spend $50 on the cheap, cheap plastic crap they sent me.YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.",1,23/09/2023
I have put return one thing from my third package I bought from and returned and which it say they receive the package and given advance refund as it is not in my account yet.  It was processed on Nov 17 and Temu received the Package at 22 November.As I have not seen the cash deposited back in my account where that shoes size for me was too small.,3,23/09/2023
Kind of great to shop from here but would like the company to increase places they can ship to.I would like to buy and send gifts through this platform.,4,23/09/2023
"There is something very underhand about the way Temu works - particularly with their product reviews. I have bought several items from them and when researching them I noticed that there were almost always entirely 5* reviews - and strangely many said that they hadn't actually tried the device yet. Most of my items were OK and arrived on time and the price was always very competitive. However one specific item was faulty - and I suspect deliberately so. It was a 256GB micro SD card which could only reliably store about 31GB. More could be written to it (and then the speed was remarkably faster when writing beyond the 31GB threshold) but this data was not the same when read back. This is a known trait of cheap memory cards. After 2 days of testing the device on 3 devices to be sure of the fault, I wanted to post a review describing this fault. However, Temu try their best to stop anything but good reviews from being posted. The choice they give is either to contact customer services OR post the bad review - not both. As I wanted a refund I headed to customer services (but I did clone the window first and managed to post the negative review later). Customer services was a poor experience. Starting with the obligatory robot, I actually got to a human fairly quickly however this then became painfully slow. I was eventually told that I had to contact the product's vendor directly regarding any fault (and how to find them). This was not acceptable as at no point was I made aware that I was dealing with anybody else but Temu when I made my purchase. Also their instructions did not reveal a vendor for the item either. The window with the Customer Services chat then got closed. So I then posted my accurate but bad review and found that the product was now discontinued - so nobody will read it. My impression is that they deliberately sell these cheap but faulty devices in small batches (everything seems to be almost sold out on Temu) and when the batch is sold they start another batch off which has no connection to the other identical faulty products previously sold so that they can start with a clean slate and nobody ever gets to know that the device actually never works. There is a happy ending to this story though. I found, on a different part of the Temu site, a different way to return of the memory card. This was so different to the other way I had tried (the one linked from posting a bad review). I wasn't asked anything about what was wrong with it. I was simply told to dispose of the memory card and await a refund - which has just arrived. You can be sure that I won't be ordering anything else from Temu though. Their small batches for each product is highly suspicious and I presume their product reviews are fake (or at best worthless because they effectively block any bad reviews).Update following Temu's response....Temu: If you had read my review above you would know that I already have my refund so there is nothing further to resolve. My review is simply a warning to others about Temu product reviews which I am sure you are not going to fix or even acknowledge.Further update on reviews: I have since posted 4 more reviews of items bought from Temu that I have actually tried out. 2 were good, 2 were bad. Here's the weird thing... I can see all my reviews of these products (good and bad). But if I look at these products when I am not logged in to Temu and using a different browser none of my reviews are there - so nobody else can see them despite the fact that I have received a confirmation email from Temu stating that my reviews are live. So they make it almost impossible to write bad reviews but if you do succeed, nobody can see them.",1,23/09/2023
Have ordered loads of times from them and to date have never had an issue!,5,23/09/2023
"I've had good experiences with temu, not had any issues myself despite some negative reviews,my orders have always been on time and I've got some excellent items, very addictive as few have said, you get what you pay for for some things but I've lots of really good stuff, what do people expect for the price on some things. Its a Risk you take when getting some items from this market in the country they're from, I've had things from here a lot better then items I've bought in the UK for 50times the price, you know what's good and what to expect, some have too high expectations.",5,23/09/2023
"Just received my first order from Temu, three items.  It was a test really to see if their cheap stuff is any good.  One item is a rip off of a well known brand of gloves.  All three items are fit only for the bin, so I won't be using this site again.",1,23/09/2023
"My three young grandchildren each chose one of your Christmas jumpers last week.  I was really pleased that all of them arrived so quickly and were exactly as shown on your website.  The children are so delighted.  I did worry that you must be so busy I might not get them early enough for them to be able to start using them through December.  Well done, Love the jumpers and you are super efficient.  Thank you.  You earned the 5 stars.",5,23/09/2023
Only given 1 as cannot give zero.  Keep getting emails daily regarding Temu pallets - I do not have an app have unsubscribed on the emails but still keep getting them sometimes 3 times a day.As of 19.12.23 this is still happening I cannot change any settings as I do not have the app,1,23/09/2023
My mother bought steps to help her get up to cupboards. They are flimsy plastic and dangerous and were broken on delivery. I don't want her to have a replacement as the hinges are plastic and come apart. This is irresponsible and thoughtless.,1,23/09/2023
"To start, I had 3 orders involving roughly 307 items. I spoke with a TEMU customer service agent to ask if it would be possible to include items from all 3 orders in the same return. He said yes. I was given a prepaid label for a return shipment but it only covered 6 or so pounds. I knew at the time that the shipment was going to weigh a lot more than 6 pounds and that it was going to require more than one box and therefore more than one return shipping label. The TEMU representative told me that I would need to print out duplicates of the same label (same tracking number) and attach these duplicates to each separate box- shipping them in that way. I suspected the UPS store would reject that method, and so the TEMU agent told me that if I was made to pay for extra shipping costs, I should keep the receipt and TEMU would refund me the cost. I went to the store and, unsurprisingly, UPS rejected the proposed shipping method and I had to pay $177.19 out of pocket for the shipping cost. 3 days later, all packages were delivered and signed for by an associate named ""LUI.""  I have delivery confirmation sheets showing that every package was delivered. I am now stuck in a loop with TEMU, as they are repeatedly claiming that their warehouse team only received 14 of the items I shipped back to them. I have attached copies of my receipt as well the delivery confirmation sheets and these documents and evidence are being entirely ignored. Despite each of these packages having been signed for, TEMU just keeps restating ""Our warehouse team reports that they did not receive the items."" So for the last 5 months, this company has been claiming that these items have vanished and that I should speak with UPS, despite having signed for the shipments, therefore holding roughly $1500 of my money hostage. I don't understand how an associate can sign for 9 packages weighing in excess of 100lb only to turn around and refund me for 14 items consisting mostly of light jewelry and beads.",1,23/09/2023
"TEMU is my favourite online shop, everything is so cheap, shipping always for free and I never had to wait longer than 2 weeks for my order. I used to use other apps like aliexpress or wish but they are rubbish. Temu is the best",5,23/09/2023
Had 2 packages stolen but they fixed it each time. THE REST OF MY ORDERS ARRIVED AS EXPECTED (2weeks).  The items I am receiving exceeds my expectations and definitely bargains. Love me some Temu,5,23/09/2023
Very cheap dollar store quality that takes a month to arrive.  The product reviews are fake,1,24/09/2023
"Temu has new return and refunds policies which are in violation of the Consumer Rights Act 2015. As they are in violation of the law, if you are affected by this, please ensure to report the issue to the trading standards. It may also be possible for you to get a refund through your banking / payment provider so do get in touch with them to report the problem if Temu refuses to accept responsibility as they have done in my case.",1,24/09/2023
The items are so cheap and of poor quality. I bought several items but most are not fit for purpose. Delivery time is decent considering it comes from a distance and you get lots of discounts and free delivery. I bought a butter knife which was like a toy for kids. A small food processor did not work for more than 20 seconds even though it had been charged for a whole day. I bought some sliders which were so light and slippery the plastic looking shoes were hazard. Temu bombards you with texts and emails about offers which can really get on your nerves. I would say they have a generous return policy. I did buy somethings which were acceptable so not all bad. I would like Temu to sell better quality items and have the pictures more accurately representing the items they sell. Temu is very cheap and I am sure there are some amazing bargains so look carefully. One other thing which concerns me is the posts about Temu taking peoples bank details and that they are being used.I am not sure if this is true but it does worry me.,2,24/09/2023
"Dreadful customer service.Package arrived at airport over 4 days ago and has not cleared customs. I have phoned the courier and they confirm it won't be released due to incorrect paperwork and duties paid. I've told temu this, honestly no less than 20 times and they constantly just keep sending the same pre-written garbage messages. Left with no choice but to chargeback with my bank and never use this awful app again. Avoid if you want your parcel. Aliexpress is better - and I never thought I'd be writing that",1,24/09/2023
Just received my first three orders from Temu.I was a bit concerned by some of the negative comments but my experience has been fantastic.I was kept fully informed on the tracking of my deliveries all of which only took a week to arrive.One item should have been a watch with 5 bracelets but I only received the watch.I contacted customer service who immediately offered a full refund either to my card or as a credit and told to keep the watch anyway.I opted for the credit as I was going to place another order anyway and it was done immediately while I was still on the online chat.What could be better than that.My experience has been brilliant.,5,24/09/2023
"Some of the items are OK. But I would NOT  bother with the games as u will be there forever. Also it expects u to keep sharing, inviting and buying in order to get bonuses. A scam to get u to keep buying. Some of the items are cheap and nasty others are OK. The cow I got was OK as were the trousers. The tops were made of horrible think shiny material. Customer service useless, keep repeating same thing.",2,24/09/2023
While it is a legitimate business ... it feels like a con ... I have been waiting for my first order for more than a month now ... all I got so far is a ??5 credit for late delivery ... but no delivery ... as if I will ever order anything againUpdate : Temu has now refunded my order !,1,24/09/2023
"I returned few items, half of them arrived, and half no as they saying. So refund I reiciveed just for the items that they said arrived to warehouse. I write to customer service, open a dispute, however reiciveed the same answer from evryoane( a copy paste answer). They don't take responsibility for lost items. In the end I didn't have the money back, and items. Poor customer service, at all and no taking responsibility for lost items.",1,24/09/2023
"Had my first order from Temu shipped to us from China.  And after opening the bag, I noticed that it is my job now to ""recycle"" the products. The quality was so bad, there is no way I could use the products. While they refund you the money and they do not even want the products shipped back to them, it was a waste of time and it will fill up our trash collection. It was worse then I expected. These products are produced to fill trash cans.",1,24/09/2023
"Don?€?t buy from this app/seller. Low quality. Products don?€?t look like on photos in terms of color, material etc. what I have got was different than photos.",1,25/09/2023
"Charged fraudulently for an order that shouldn't have been - I have an email from them saying ""Your Temu order has been canceled due to payment failure"", but I was charged.I ordered the same lot again and now I (kind of) have 2 orders as one of the packages has not arrived.Even then there were countless damaged items as it seems the items are packaged by fools. And to make it worse there are also missing items.And the returns and refund process is horrendous - I've spent two hours on a chat with them trying to sort it.Save yourself the pain.EDIT in response to Temu's response:I went onto your chat and it was a horrendous experience. It took 2 hours and even now my issues aren't resolved. The person I was chatting to was completely inept an unable to understand the issue - he was beyond useless. He just kept repeating the same thing to me even though I had told him he hadn't understood me and, each time, I repeated the issue.So don't go out and make out that you've a good way to solve things as the issue you created has been made worse by the, so-called, service.If customer satisfaction was your utmost important thing then you'd not be having incompetent buffoons failing the customer/Oh, and I forgot to add, the products that we got - mostly cheap, poor quality tat - it's all going back",1,25/09/2023
"I have given TEMU the benefit of doubt, however the last three orders that I have received there is something wrong.  I now have 2 blouses hanging in my closet that I will never wear I get notifications that something is sold out. but replaced with something similar to my order NOT!!! I also have, count them 10 bras that don't fit and they just kept coming. 7 wireless black bras that fasten in the front & 3 sports bras that were never ordered as well. Frustrated and disappointed. When TEMU is good it is great, But when it's bas it is very BAD!!! I did Call customer service and I was credited  $0.02  How Disrespectful and Offensive was that? I am at my wits end",2,25/09/2023
"After my review on trust pilot, TEMU have now been in touch and given me a full refund without the need to return the defective item. Many thanks to the TEMU team",1,25/09/2023
"Warning.????????????????This is my personal experiance with TemuI placed an order for about 8 items. They gave me a free pair if ear buds that dont work, came without any box or instuctions, they dont work and wont connec to anything.  I bought as door bell that is also broken and was a waste of money, Everything I bought is cheap products of the lowest quality and now they are making it next to impossible to send them back to them. Temu when you read this if you would like to contact me to sort this out by all means do so. Literally everything is either broken or such an cheap rubbish products.????????????????????????????They send separate parcels so you only get 1 free return and all the other cheap rubbish has to be paid for me to return it",1,25/09/2023

"I didn't recieve my items worth ??60, package was just chucked outside for anyone to take and photo to prove also. When asking for a refund into my temu account (meaning i would still have to spend with them) or have the items resent, I have been told no it's not their problem and its the buyers (my) problem if I didn't receive my package. My 7 year old son brought his own football boots out of his pocket money hes saved for so long and was so excited to get them and now I have to tell him he can't have them and replace his money. I have spent ??600 this month on temu and for them to not do a good will in resending is disgusting. Don't not use them ! It's not all that it seems to be that's for sure",1,25/09/2023
"Love all of the products. Some of extremely good quality such as gloves, shoes etc. Art and craft at a 3rd price that found in shops",4,25/09/2023
"I?€?ve never had a problem with this company! You get what you pay for! Yes some of the stuff is crap quality but what did you expect from the prices lol Other than that they?€?ve always delivered and if items are late credit is put on to your account. If you ain?€?t happy with an item send it back and refund is given, sometime they don?€?t even ask you to send the item back they automatically refund you. Been buying from here for months and never had a problem.",5,25/09/2023

"Further, to my review in November, in which I expressed significant disappointment in Temu. I have since ordered again and the service has been faultless. They are now using Australia Post for delivery and so the items are arriving quickly and on time.

"Temu said my order would be here December 11. It came today, the 5th. I'm super impressed with the quality and accurate sizes of the robe and pajamas I ordered my grandson for Christmas.

"I have been using TEMU for many months and many orders.  I have never had any problems with payment, shipment, or receipt of product.

"Happy with all purchases, only once slight problem which I managed to resolve myself with regards to a wee repair to a garment which was still worth the price and think they are good value  for money.

"Great. I have ordered several times from temu, I found everything was as described and all arrived earlier than I thought.

"I ordered for 65??? material, their site showed delivery on 20/11 but nothing was presented. Or delivered.My complaint was denied because their information showed it as delivered by BPost which was untrue. The provide T&T number did not function. Temu keeps saying they will do everything to improve on guture deliveries but this is a malpractice.Het antwoord via Trustpulot is identiek aan de antwoorden die ik gedurende de laatste 8 dagen gekregen heb via hun customer service applicatie. Een return kan niet (niets ontvangen) en hersturen wordt geweigerd en bij vragen voor refund wordt aangegeven dat her bezorgd is. Ik heb het opgegeven omdat ik vermoed dat er een Chatbot voor de afhandeling zorgt.",1,26/09/2023

"I?€?m surprised at the bad reviews. I?€?ve ordered many, many times with not one bad experience. The only issue I?€?ve found is that some companies will say 925 or sterling silver in the title but farther down, it says copper. This is terrible for customers who want to buy heirloom jewelry. I report these when I see them but not sure if any action is taken, other than that, I love Temu. You just have to read their sizes for clothes, and I?€?ve had no trouble. I wish their coats were lined and more cotton was offered but the prices are too good to complain.",5,27/09/2023
My email somehow got changed in my account and now I can?€?t log into my account to view past orders and my main concern is all my personal information in my account.  I have been going in circles with customer service and it?€?s ridiculous how inept they are.  I was using the app and just recently received a credit on my account for shipment not received.  About 1 day later I go and tap on the app and instead of logging me in it is asking me for a password for this email that is not mine.  Even if I reset the password the 6 digit code gets sent to this email that I don?€?t have access to.  I can?€?t tell you how many times I have explained this to all the agents I spoke with and they keep telling how to reset my password.  Waiting on a call and hopefully this gets resolved soon :(,1,27/09/2023
I was worried to use the app after I saw all the reviews about cards getting stolen and packages not arriving but I have had no issues with temu or its sellers and have ordered over 10+ times.

They started the day after I signed up to TEMUOne of Temu's employees or suppliers has leaked/taken my email address and is using it for spam fraud emails!

"The store concept is the same as Wish and AliExpress but compared to those two, Temu is Surprisingly fast on delivery.They have an app that?€?s user friendly but I could do without all their flashy popups that tries to create a sense of urgency to get that one time deal that runs out soon.. Anyway I ordered two super cheap reservoir pens and a 50ml bottle of ink for a total of ???10Both pens work very well and the ink is better than the store bought ink I normally use for 3x the price.the packaging wasn?€?t super protective (basically just a plastick bag) so the box for the ink was pretty banged up, but the bottle was ok so no major issues and less packaging equals less waste so there?€?s that.",5,27/09/2023

It was however too far from the mostly London based press.So I am always looking for technology for the best price.

Everything, so far, is available with free shipping to the UK. On Aliexpress around 80% of items won't ship to the UK.   Also all prices include UK VAT, so no customs or tax surprises at check-out or on delivery.   Finally I find that most items on Temu are priced accurately.  Other sellers entice you in with a low price, only to find that it is 6.99 just for a power cable, whilst the actual device that you wanted is 59.99.  This saves me wasting time during product searches.A small negative.  Initially I was getting flooded with cheesey messages from Temu, free gifts etc - many times a day.  Thankfully now that I have placed around 6 orders, these messages have stopped.",5,28/09/2023
"No complaints, great service. Cancelled part of my order, and refund was in my bank within days. Got frequent updates on remainder of order, and delivered in time. Happy with Christmas string lights received.",5,28/09/2023
Since downloading the Temu app I have been inundated with scam emails. Avoid!,1,28/09/2023
My package has been sitting at the airport for 7 days this company refuses to do anything but tell me what your delivery date is not until XYZ your package shouldn't be sitting at the airport for 7 full days I will never buy anything off of this company again be aware if you going to buy something your package is going to be sitting at the airport for 9 10 days that's sitting there waiting for nobody to go pick it up .I am new with temu they do like to lie I've been lied to so many times before I placed an order I specifically asked who they use I was specifically was told they only use United States Post Office which I found out was a lie.       I did not  confirm my order  before they charge my credit card ..be careful. they use this  ontrack delivery service if they give you a phone number for this company it's only automated they do not speak to any one over the phone its online chat.... temu  tells customers to call the person that is delivering your packages they can care less where your package is I do not know any delivery carrier that it doesn't give you up to date tracking information now they use several delivery companies this not one...,1,28/09/2023
"I've ordered many items thru Temu and seldom disappointed. Their prices are great and free shipping w $15 order (not hard to achieve that limit). The rare times I've had issues and let them know, I was instantly reimbursed. My suggestions: In clothing sizes run small so I normally order up a size. Many packages are not labeled so often I must refer to my invoice to determine what the item is (there's so many unique choices I don't find w my instore shopping). I do get daily ""games"" which are kind of gimmicky to get you to shop again .... ie spin the wheel (hint, you always get the largest discount). But I still find that fun and usually end up ordering at 85% off (or similar). I like and recommend them!!",5,29/09/2023
"Your clothing description always states tshirt and unless you Actually READ what item is, you think you're going to get a Nice Cotton Tshirt and you send these these TERRIBLE POLYESTER PRODUCTS.WILL NEVER BUY CLOTHING AGAIN  !  !",1,29/09/2023
"I used to like Temu -I made 3 quite large orders and most of the stuff was good -some bits were not so good but I followed their system for substandard goods and it was brilliant, immediate credit went on my account and was told to keep the faulty goods. For someone who lives in a small Cornish village with no post office and being 63 and disabled this was perfect. and there was only a couple of thing that were crap. recently i put 3 more orders in and when the 1st one arrived thing a were missing and others were cheap and nasty, when went to process this info it's all changed and stuff has to be returned. they give you one of those funny box thing to scan to get a returns label..and i have no printer i got to speak to someone  from Temu and got nowhere but round in circles  looks like i will end up keeping the crap and am now worried about the next 2 orders i am waiting for",2,29/09/2023
Orders did not arrive and found customer service a waste of time. Evry delivery service was even worse  to talk to. Felt I was ripped off,1,29/09/2023
"It?€?s a scam ? You cannot trust this website. Left the leaflet that delivered -wasn?€?t. No information on the note, no email confirmation about order. Maybe someone lucky but not me .",1,29/09/2023
In their policy it says that yu get a refund for a parcel that yu have not received that is false they don't stick to their own policy so I will never shop from them again!,1,29/09/2023
As with many when ordering from so far overseas you are a little bit apprehensive. I'd heard from others who had ordered from Temu and had no problems so I figured I would give it a try and make an order from there. In fact I ended up making two orders in quick succession and can happily say it's been a great experience. Both orders arrived quite quick given international shipping and the tracking service is great keeping you updated. All items arrived as described to.,5,29/09/2023
"Package not received, courier confirmed unsuccessful and uncompliant delivery. Temu won?€?t refund and adamant package was delivered even though not to myself! Back and forth with messages to no avail! Loss of money",1,29/09/2023
"Update 5/12/2023Temu's reply to this has, once again done absolutely nothing to fix the situation. Thank you for suggesting I go back onto Temu chat!Absolutely appalling. I place quite a large order mainly consisting of Christmas presents. Evri have said on 10 occasions that they would be delivering on that day (on each occasion we have had to make sure that someone is in). Needless to say nothing has arrived, not only that but on the system they have said it was left in the safe place and on another occasion that I turned it away. Both these statements were retracted upon me querying them. When contacting Temu - which I have done several times I get the usual standard replies and get passed on. Apparently I cannot have a refund as the order is out for delivery ..... but the order is continually in and out of delivery. It has been the most frustrating online shopping experience that I have ever had and it was the first time I used Temu. Absolutely nobody will help.",1,29/09/2023
So far so good. I have received 3 orders out of 5 and they all arrived in good conditions and promptly too. I am kind of addicted to Temu at the moment as I am moving into a new home and I have been finding fantastic and cute kitchen and bathroom stuffs here at affordablepricestoo!. Keep it up TEMU!????,5,29/09/2023
Been told parcel will arrive by 15th ordered 2nd told should be 3 to 5 days look like it is going to be far more I should have trusted my original thought Temu can?€? be trusted,1,29/09/2023
"What I will say is this. I?€?ve received everything I?€?ve ordered, were they all perfect? No but for the prices it?€?s expected. My concern is since using Temu I get a lot more fraudulent looking emails and spam calls and I?€?m almost certain they?€?re related esp seeing other reviews on here stating similar experiences. So I question the safety of your information and card on Temu. Customer service also isn?€?t great. Impossible to directly contact a shop yourself.",3,29/09/2023
I normally order from Temu at least once a month now ( my husband put his foot down). When I first started I was ordering 3 to 4 times a month. I love this company. I had an item damaged and they issued me a refund immediately and the same when my order was lost. They also gave a 5 dollar credit because my package was a day late. Easy to contact by message and an immediate response.,5,29/09/2023
steel my money disguesting now i hve to contact to my bank to get my money back,1,29/09/2023
"When I first joined the service was excellent. However now it takes so long before orders arrive, I can have three orders from Ebay and Amazon before Temu arrives. The products are inferior and there is no customer care. If there is a problem all you will have is a A1 computer system that doesn't workResponse to TemuTemu have sent an automated response that their computer sends to everyone. There is no customer service. Their orders are taking longer and longer. The majority of items are of poor quality from china. The main concern was lack of customer service only A1 robots, which sadly responded to this and other peoples reviews",2,30/09/2023
Black Friday I was offered a cat house at 90% off I think I had to order 4 more items at there sell price but when I got as far as the check out the price had gone up. I deleted what was in my cart and thought that would delete the order but no they have filled and charger me then sent the confirmation to a email that I don?€?t use. I have been trying to find an email that I can talk to someone and of course I can?€?t find one. So next step will be calling my credit card company. Please learn from my mistakes if it sounds to good to be true it is. Shelia Baucom,1,30/09/2023
I was skeptical at first about ordering items from this company. I thought I?€?d give it a whirl and if I only spent ??10 and wasn?€?t satisfied it wasn?€?t going to break the bank. I?€?ve been pleasantly surprised and subsequently order quite regularly. Most of the items have been better quality than I thought for the price. I recently bought a bag and I?€?ve had a lot of compliments on it. It?€?s good quality and looks like a product from monsoon. I?€?ve never bought from apps before so have nothing to compare it to but I really like Temu. The only criticism is that the items take longer to arrive than I thought they would but after ordering a few times I know to order well in advance or just be patient as they do arrive eventually.,5,30/09/2023
"A Mixed Bag of Bargains with Room for ImprovementMy experience with Temu has been a bit of a rollercoaster, but it's undeniably a budget shopper's paradise. The prices are a major highlight, offering some fantastic deals on a variety of products. There's a treasure trove of affordable gems, making it easy to find quality items without breaking the bank.While some products are absolute steals, it's essential to acknowledge that the quality can be hit or miss. Occasionally, I've stumbled upon hidden gems that exceeded expectations, but there have been instances where the purchased items turned out to be subpar.One noteworthy aspect of Temu is their customer-friendly refund policy. When faced with disappointment, the refund process has been surprisingly smooth, providing a reassuring safety net for those occasional duds.On the flip side, the delivery time leaves much to be desired. Patience is a virtue when ordering from Temu, as the delivery can take up to three weeks. This extended wait time might not be ideal for those seeking quick gratification.For gaming enthusiasts, the Fishland and Farmland games add an entertaining twist to the shopping experience. Winning, however, proves to be a challenging feat, making it a bit of a gamble. Nevertheless, the prospect of snagging great deals adds an element of excitement to the overall shopping adventure.In conclusion, Temu is a budget-friendly haven with its share of ups and downs. If you're willing to navigate through occasional delivery delays and take a gamble on quality, the affordability and occasional fantastic finds make it worth exploring. Just be prepared for a bit of patience and a dash of luck!",4,30/09/2023
"My original experience with Temu was not great. The app had recently released in Australia and the rating system was bordering on deceptive as the reviews you saw was for all products from the seller, not just the one you are buying. This has been changed now.The app is easy to use, it is a good idea to have a good look as different sellers post the same item at different prices but still pretty reasonable and there are some very interesting items that you might not see anywhere else.They have definitely improved their service and processes and worth giving a go.",4,30/09/2023
"I have never had any problems with Temu and I've ordered from them quite a lot. Once I received a product that didn't match the description but I received a refund and shipping label for a free return so that worked out smoothly. Also, on one occasion I didn't read the description properly of the item I ordered and when I contacted Temu they refunded that too. Some of the items they sell are of a lesser quality, but in all fairness; you get what you pay for. I've liked plenty of the items that I have purchased and the quality has been fine, so no complaints here.",4,30/09/2023
"I am on my 20th order from temu, it?€?s a great site, there have been a couple of issues with clothing not being sized correctly, but was sorted and refunded immediately and I donated the clothes to the homeless shelter, so everyone was happy,I don?€?t do the games, and have not been asked to do this review?€?..I usually buy craft items, clothing, and kitchen items, always very good quality?€?The delivery by evri can be a bit of a hit and miss but they have only not delivered on time once and i automatically got a ??5 credit, so thank you",5,30/09/2023
"Do not buy from this company. They state on here that if your parcel isn?€?t delivered or if it is damaged you get a refund but they DO NOT give you one! They are lying thieves. I had a parcel which was delivered to outside my house just left in an unsafe place, as no one was at home and it has either been robbed or re took by the driver and they will not refund it and will not offer any compensation! If you want to be robbed by this company then buy from there but if you don?€?t AVOID AVOID AVOID! I am now down on money that they won?€?t refund",1,30/09/2023
After deadline of delivery they cancelled the order from their side. And customer service said simply to re order again.,1,30/09/2023
"Liars and not sticking to their offer: My friend recommended it to me and should've received ??50 for it, but received nothing. Misleading: I was meant to get ??100 as an introductory new customer gift/off, but it's split over several purchases over a certain amount, as percentage. Misleading: Clothing they send is not the same as displayed on pictures. I.e. bought a pair of lovely looking woolly knitted oversee socks for my daughter for school, and they were made of some polyester yarn that in the 80s used to be used for cableknit jerseys.Bought an electric toothbrush set for over ??20 and it worked 2 times.The small toys under ??2 you'd have in stockings or in party bags are well worth their value. These purchases were made from January through to July as some items we didn't return and thought we have to digure out what is good and what not.",2,01/10/2023
"I have been using Temu for a while, bought many different things from Temu, I just love it, quality clothes and quality products, delivery was very good and the packaging was very good too, communication was great too, thank you Temu team.

"Unable to give it zero, so one is lowest I can give. My 88 year old mother is physically frail, but mentally on the ball and uses her IPad to shop on line. She?€?s not daft and uses one debit card for on line shopping. She has no account with Temu, nether do I. She receives a new debit card, little used anywhere but trusted websites. I have third party access to watch her bank and Legal Power of Attorney etc. Sadly I didn?€?t notice a small test purchase for a little over ??1 go through the account, I was away and try not to access banks on insecure broadband. Two weeks later there are nearly 120 transactions on her bank account, Nothing over ??20, totalling ??1200. We contact the bank to try to stop the items being paid for and stop the card. On the advice of the bank we contact Temu to advise them it?€?s fraud. The bank are helpful, Temu are not, virtual talk only. Countless messages, copy statements, proof of I.D later and a month of repeating everything after being pushed from one department to another, they say it?€?s not fraud, maybe I.D theft and that 120 transactions on a debit card to an address that?€?s not that of the card holder, to a name that?€?s not that of the card holder is not suspicious. Bear in mind my mother has no account with them, but according to staff at Temu, she must have asked someone to order on her behalf. Needless to say she wasn?€?t inundated with parcels. Credit to the bank, once Temu had responded they saw it for what it was and repaid the lost funds, great work by them and NatWest will get a very positive review. Having spoken to Temu, I?€?m now being bombarded with junk, spam and other rubbish from them. Good luck if you use them, my advice to anyone I know is to avoid at all costs.",1,01/10/2023
The shipping carrier YTO global express for Temu in Australia is terrible they are constantly taking packages to the wrong addresses the delivery drivers need to be educated to ensure packages are taken to the correct addresses for their customers or change carriers because this is unacceptable,1,01/10/2023
I buy from temu and the products are very good! But need more men 10.5 shoe sizes,4,01/10/2023

"The makeup and beauty products from temu have been amazing quality for the price. The only thing to look out for is the amount of product you are perching so look how much you receive for your money.Household supplies I can not fault, example love my glasses set and spoons that are like little spades adorable.Clothing and shoes, look at what it is made from and remember Chinese shoe size is different, I am a 4 in UK size and 5 on Temu but it gives you measurements anyway if in doubt.Highly recommend this site for except I am now addicted to Temu",5,01/10/2023
Useless company,1,01/10/2023

This is my favourite online shopping company. I have used them a lot over the past few weeks and have received lots of great products at a very low price. If you haven?€?t used Temu you simply must. Temu keep up the good work.,5,02/10/2023
Scam. They have tricky tactics to get you to buy something. I logged into the app and an offer come on saying if I spent $20 I get a coupon for $200. This was not the offer at all but there was no fine print and it had just taken me to the check out which kept promising me a $200 coupon. Unable to resolve. Don?€?t bother with this app complete rubbish,1,02/10/2023
Just received my seventh parcel order from Temu. Out of the 30 items received in total only one never lived up to the description or quality I was expecting but for the money paid it was reasonable. Very fast dispatch and delivery ranges from 6 to 9 days from China. Great place for everything. Never tried the clothing as yet.,5,02/10/2023
"I have had 2 orders, The items ordered were Pretty pleased with. The issues I have is that you get bombarded with pop ups while trying to shop and the Prices before vouchers Are not in the slightest Genuine, ?€?You?€?ve saved ??80?€? as a example yet the entire order is not worth that. Then theres the pressure to buy things that Is annoying. Since signing up i?€?ve had Atleast 8 scam emails a day From various scammers. I have not signed up to anything else using that Email only Temu. The 3rd thing is they flagged my last review and wanted it removed so They?€?re trying to hide the issues they have. My Orignal Review was genuine as is this one and the way you have responded to my review has Now convinced me you Are a company that can?€?t be trusted or professional if you?€?re going to have any negitive Reviews taken down. Suprise Suprise they?€?ve Flagged this one too! clearly they only want good reviews shown.",2,02/10/2023
I had a link on Facebook for Black Friday River Island sale and purchased goods for ??51. The website looked like the normal river island and I paid by debit card. I subsequently realised that I had not had a confirmation email from them. I then went onto their website ( not through Facebook) and was confused to see the items were not on sale. I then checked my orders under my river island account and found no orders pending. Finally I went into my online banking and was shocked to find that ??51.00 had been taken under TEMU.com!! It seems that they had cloned RI site to steal my money. It?€?s been nearly two weeks now but I have to wait for 30 days to confirm no arrival of goods ( which I wouldn?€?t have wanted from Temu anyway) before the bank can start an investigation. Absolutely shameful to steal peoples money.,1,02/10/2023
"I was sceptical at first as I thought these can?€?t be much good for the price but after hearing some reviews I got my first purchase and to be honest I wasn?€?t disappointed so I bought again and again and every item I purchased was exactly as shown.  Only draw back was the packaging, but the actual product lived up to expectations.  I will keep on ordering?€? I love TEMU! You are updated constantly from ordering to delivery.",5,02/10/2023

"I used to shop on shein a lot but been switching to temu. Returns were so simple and easy compared than shein. Shein would break my order into several returns while temu was 1 return for 1 order. Temu return somehow was quicker too. Since returns were so simple, I was not worry about quality. If I don?€?t like it then I know I can return it. Obviously unused of course to qualify.  I just love temu.",5,02/10/2023
"I regretted placing my orders from Temu. I ordered several items, that they promised would come within 2 weeks, 8 parcels for that matter, all I could receive was some useless emails that those parcels had been delivered via Evri,  for over 2 months, up till now, we're still on the matter. the worst is that you can never see a normal human being to talk to. To get their direct phone number is a case, email or stuff like that are not reachable, I have the track number or code of each parcel, but I can't find those parcels till now, no solutions. I regret doing business with them, I can not recommend Temu to even my enemies.",1,02/10/2023
"I tried Temu recently because I was led there by their aggressive  advertising. I got sucked into buying a couple of cheap items... because I was told Id get $150 of free stuff. Needless to say the 'free stuff' turned into more confusing and irritating games: just got 2 emails telling me to claim my 'mystery box'and a link which just sends you to an endless list of completely random stuff and a clock ticking down at the top, then I got a message saying I could get ?€?3 items for ??10?€?, clicking the link I get sent to another endless list, not to be defeated I choose 3 items (total ??90) and go to checkout?€?...oddly my ?€?3 items for ??10?€? no longer applies because they still want to charge me ??90. So more games. To illustrate how insidious their marketing is : After using Temu for just 1 hour I had 94 new messages in my inbox. Then I checked out trust pilot and wrote this review (Im a behavioural psychologist with a degree in marketing and I can tell you: most of the glowing reviews for Temu on Trust Pilot are quite obviously fake), within minutes Trust Pilot had messaged me saying Temu were asking for more information (which I will do as I want to keep my review up), it?€?s interesting that they have all these fake positive reviews that don?€?t provide any customer details or specific goods/orders, yet intimidate and honest reviewers who want to give an accurate account of how Temu operate. Anyway, shall update my review when I receive my initial order, watch this space (if Temu don?€?t have it taken down that is).",1,02/10/2023
Delivery is absolutely terrible- was due to be delivered by Evri today however now delayed!!!! Temu really should look to getting a different delivery service .,1,03/10/2023

"Bag I received was dented and leather creased, cannot give it as a present. Temu will only refund ??3.49 and bag cost me nearly 3 times that! Now I know how they make such a lot of money. Will not be ordering from them again. This bag was received damaged and therefore I should be entitled to a FULL refund not just ??3.49.",1,03/10/2023
"I don?€?t even wanna give any star at all. Waiting for my order so long and end up that they lost my order. It is multiple order from collection of shops. And it was happened 2 times lost my order.  Very disappointed. Untrustworthy marketplace.They refund my money, but it is not about that. I just want my orders, not waiting for 3 weeks and then they inform that your order was missing.",1,03/10/2023
"After reading so many negative reviews I wish to give my opinion after shopping with them regularly during the past 6 months .    Temu quality reflects the price you pay , I have returned goods and been given a full refund , as for goods not arriving on time I cannot speak on that issue as I?€?ve never ordered items for a specific date, If that was my criteria I would order way before needed to avoid disappointment.",5,03/10/2023
"Worst experience ever. They short-shipped my order and it took 9 weeks to arrive, in tatters. The order was missing the 2 main items I even placed the order for. They don?€?t honor their discount codes and they refuse to renew, even when they made the mistakes that ruined your order. They force you to order in a small window or you can?€?t use any code. When you chat with them, the language barrier is so wide that you can?€?t have any meaningful conversation. I would never ever recommend using Temu to anyone. It?€?s the absolute worst experience and nobody should be waiting for Christmas gifts in February if they read this review.",1,03/10/2023
"If I could give one star, I wouldPlease do not order from this company. They steal you bank details and other sensitive information.

I had the pleasure dealing with this rubbish company days ago and was told they couldnt deliver to a P.O. Box which when purchasing doesn?€?t state it anywhere on there website nor at the checkout area. I waited for the order to arrive only to get updates via the tracking number days after the actual date and when it came to the day it was supposed arrive the tracking said couldn?€?t deliver to a P.O. Box which is attached to a actual post office which I?€?m sure they could have left there for me to pick up over the counter. When I approached customer service and explained it all they could not tell me where the section was on the website no delivery to P.O. Box. I asked if I could still have my order and they informed me I couldn?€?t because it was already on its way back and that I would have to get a refund which takes anywhere from 5 to 14 business days maybe even up to 30 days in some cases and I would then have to reorder the goods I wanted and I don?€?t know if I would wanna do through all that again to find out it couldn?€?t be delivered again hahaha. So anyway my suggestion is do yourself a favour and never never ever deal with this disgraceful company in your life. It should be closed down by trading officials it?€?s a disgrace to online shopping,1,03/10/2023
"Ok firstly use a computer not your mobile and there you go spam,pop ups etc gone it's that simple  As for people complaining about drill bits etc we'll what do you get expect for ??1, the bad reviews are only because people want Gucci for the price of primark there delusional. Use your head and there are quality bargains out there like LED strip lights, caps etc. Delivery is quick but as usual people want in an instant from China, it's not exactly next door so stop moaning. So my experience has been 5 star with Temu and I will use again.",5,03/10/2023
"I haven't bought anything from Temu and I will never do. They might be the cheapest product supplier in the world but their spamming policy made me remove the app.  I invested my time in their Farmland for 2 months but it was a total waste of time as they misled me about my goals. It's impossible to get two discount vouchers and two free products from them with their Farmland system. It's endless and it expires at the end. I was given 180 days to complete watering. I spent my time, I invited people and watered the farm every single day. I had only 0.10 to get my stuff but eventually, it deducted $0.05 and it was the time I realised they were just scamming. I'm sure it would keep taking 0.10 then 0.01... When you turn off your all notifications, you still get push notifications.  Every time you log in, you keep getting spam pop-in screens which pushes you to make them gain new members to get discounts etc. but there's always a catch! You can't turn off the pop up windows which keeps asking your phone number to send SMS. I've added ??200 items to my basket to buy when I get my vouchers and free items from Farmland just because I believed I could but you can never get any free items or discounts with Temu. It's all a scam and if you have this app, uninstall it immediately. Total waste of time over 2 months...China doesn't have a system to prevent these kinds of scams. You don't have anywhere to make a complaint like Trading Standards - if this company was in the UK, they wouldn't exist right now...I would buy from you Temu if you didn't give false promises. You are losing with your scamming...",1,04/10/2023
"Be warned, avoid..Purchased a knitted cardigan 3xl. No tracking info was provided and the package arrived unexpectedly.The item is way to small, a really bad fit and cheap material, sleeves are way too short.No response from 'customer service'.Shockingly bad.",1,04/10/2023
"I love it. Ordered more than 50 parcels and everything but one arrived  within the time it said it would. I received compensation for the one that did not arrive in time, i think i was delayed a day or two only.",5,04/10/2023
"My first order for pickle ball bats was great. No complaints, .But . Subsequent order was delivered, but the items are very poor quality. Cheap plastic rubbish. Would never have bought the items from a shop. Mostly binned. A charity shop wouldn't even want them. The items look good on the ads, but the reality isn't as it appears. And after ordering , my credit card has been scammed 3 times. So no more Temu shopping.",2,04/10/2023
BEWARE OF QUALITY?€?Ordered. set of Drill Bits first one broke after about 30 seconds. BEWARE OF RETUNING  GOODS?€?..Returned as requested only to be told NOT received despite them telling me package had been accepted at that Warehouse spent 20 minutes speaking to customer ( LACK OF ) service who eventually told me they had received the parcel but nothing in it !!!!!!! Why would I send an empty package to China for the sake of ??4.50 ish. BE WARNED,1,04/10/2023
Product was good and as expected. The delivery however is extremely poor. Delivery drivers threw the purchase onto the front door on one occasion and on another they threw it over the fence,3,04/10/2023
"When i bought a whistle, it broke immediately and i injured my hand. I was lucky that my child didn't get hurt, but that can happen in this shop.",1,05/10/2023
"We have been buying from Temu for a while, the successful products far out number the couple of things that weren't the best of quality. One parcel went missing as soon as we contacted customer service they straight away sent us a replacement, so cannot fault them at all. My wife adores the dresses she has bought from Temu, at excellent prices a fraction of the price you would pay in the shop.",5,05/10/2023
"Very good quality and reasonable cost... the only trade-off is the time to deliver, but I can live with it provided the costs are competitive.",5,05/10/2023
Just really love this online store it has everything that you can think of great value prices. Great place to find party supplies at wedding stuff u name it they have it amazing products,5,05/10/2023
"It's a real lucky dip with the goods you buy on Temu.. some are good value, others if you saw them in a shop going for free, you would still keep walking. My gripe is with the delivery companies they use. Totally dodgy companies that claim to deliver your goods at 1am in the morning. Temu refunded the first delivery that went missing per their website promise. However another delivery went missing and they refuse to pay up. They claim they have verified the parcel was delivered correctly but will provide no information. The delivery company only replies that the items were delivered and cannot provide any proof of delivery. So Temu choose extremely dodgy delivery companies instead of Aus Post and don't care at all about their customers, despite what they say, and the customer bears the financial burden of lost money/goods. Not happy. Beware - sometimes you don't even get what you pay for.Update following Temu response: another computer generated message. Temu customer service have been contacted several times. If you get to message a real person they have no authority and have to escalate higher. That person just closes the ticket saying that the parcel has been delivered. The courier company was PFLogistics another Chinese company. They offloaded my parcel to a third party Freightster to deliver. Nobody responds",1,05/10/2023
"I received my order today. Four days late with one of the three items missing parts and damaged. It would cost me more than the product to purchase a bag to return the item, therefore I will not be requesting a refund. I have been credited $5.00 for late delivery. This is very disappointing as three previous orders were faultless in every way.",2,05/10/2023
Didn?€?t deliver product and would do anything about it,1,05/10/2023
Temu is a great company in that unlike other big retail companies their prices are extremely low. They have a huge variety in each category. It is a comparatively new company and the way they are growing in the next 6-8 years it will beat big companies,5,05/10/2023
Upgrade from 3 to 4 stars. 3 of 4 items were OK. The other was poor quality but after sending pictures they have agreed to refund the money.,4,05/10/2023
"Temu is an affordable site with some unique products. However, their customer service stinks. I have now been trying for 2 days to reach an intelligent human being to discuss my unique problem and I have wasted over 2 hours trying to do so. I'm not sure their off shore personnel (Phillipiness) even understand the patiently communicated problem yet alone have the skill to resolve it. A request for a Manager to call me back has fallen of deaf ears. I must now cut back onmy dealing with this company.",1,05/10/2023
"Extremely  irritating, bombarded with spam, Details sold on!!! I did my first order a few months ago and since then I have I started to get spam from other companies mentioning my Temu account. So I believe Temu have sold my details on.  Constantly bombarding me with spam, day in , day out. You've won, you're special, here's some discount, oh no the item you looked at is almost gone etc etc etc. literally 8 emails a day from scammy accounts / spam emails I am getting no matter how much I block them they keep on coming. Well now I?€?m going to have to get rid of my email address and create a new one because they have illegally sold my personal details on and I urge everyone to avoid TEMU like the plague!Update 30/11/23 - TEMU have flagged my review as fake so I?€?ve had to send evidence I made an order to Trustpilot or my review would be taken down LOL!TEMU are  Happy to illegally sell your details on but not happy to be called out about it. Funny that bunch of crooks!Edit again 30/11/23 in reply to your reply TEMU stop doing damage control and just admit you sell customers details on illegally! I know how to block spam emails etc my point is they?€?re coming through as TEMU scam emails at least 8 times a day. You should be disgusted with yourself ????????",1,05/10/2023

"I was very impressed by the service from Temu my parcel arrived very quickly to France,some items were not as I expected but I cannot fault their return procedure.I sent the parcel to a local depot and my refund was made withing a few days.Would defiantly use again.But check the product description more carefully in future and then I wont need to return items.",5,06/10/2023
"I  love this site.  The same items on Amazon are much more expensive and I bet they came from the same Chinese suppliers on Temu.  I needed to return some boots (too small).  Very easy to do.

I've been using temu for about 6 months and yeah not everything goes to plan but you cannot ask for a better refund service and let's be honest you do get some good and sometimes great quality items for your money and other times you get what you paid for . It's a fair priced site with lots to choose from and so if you have a massive selection it's hard to keep control of everything you send out . No complaints from me .one last thing temu always keep you up to date with your tracking and its always correct .. go temu 100% happy customer,5,06/10/2023
"I have bought clothing, accessories, and home goods on Temu. I've used it since May 2023 and this is November.  PROSLots of products, sometimes identical to what's on Amazon.Communication is very good at all stages of purchase and shipping. 10 day shipping guarantee.Quality is generally good but a few pieces have been not as high quality as I prefer. Many products have exact measurements which is helpful. Returns are easy and you have your choice of UPS or USPS. Refunds for returns are very fast.CONSNotifications are too numerous so I turned off the permissions. Some promotions and discount bundles work. However the promotion to invite friends to get a large discount appears to be a racket. At first you rapidly get to 50% progress, and can get to as high as 80% or 90% progress but after that you keep inviting people and it never gets to completion for you to get the discount. So just ignore that if you come across it. The products are already affordable enough.",4,06/10/2023
"I have used Temu quite a bit over the last 4 months. Have ordered a wide variety of products from clothing, household goods, craft stuff, fishing equipment, toys etc. only had one parcel turn up later than expected and received a coupon the very next day. Only thing I would say is to double check and then check again the description and exactly what you are ordering. For example I ordered a red calf sleeve with in built shin pad. Now people would think that you would get two one for each leg. But you only get one. Upon re reading the description it does say one piece. So lesson learned. Just waiting to process a refund on an indoor aerial as I couldn't get any signal from it. But so far no major issues.",5,06/10/2023
"The first time I ordered on this website,  received my order today and was shocked as it is not even close to what ordered! Such a cheap and poor quality! completely different from what they advertised on the website! very disappointed!",1,06/10/2023
You know I really like your site it does have a lot of good stuff on it I have ordered dresses for me and I love them then I worked really hard to get money into my PayPal to buy for my husband to have something nice in the passed 3 to 4 weeks I have spent well over 100 dollars if not more then when I get each shipment in the shirts for my husband are 2 sizes to small and I went a size bigger just in case Then the next one come in that had the Jackets in it and they was 2 sizes to smallI was so sad that he had nothing so I tryed one more time I even went 2 sizes bigger and they set a size smaller Then in the next Package was a shirt and teeth whitening that I didn?€?t even order but I paid for it and I know I would not order this cause I got no teeth I was upset for sometime then I found out my Frist return was free but not my others so I decided that it was just not worth me paying for it because I had did maybe 6 different orders so I did the next best thing and went out and found someone that could wear them and or use it?€?.I?€?m still going to order from your site even after this only because you do have good sizes on my dresses that I love and a billfold that I will order more colors that I love so I will have them to put up for me in the near futureBut please please make it more easy for people to make sure they know the size and they need to order bigger or smaller And please talk to your people about making sure that the order is right I just felt like you should know what I have been through and I know it?€?s not all y?€?all?€?s fault I do take some of it but it would be nice to make it more friendly user for us older people to be able to order the right sizeThank you for your time And thank you for looking into this And I sure hope you have a very nice day,4,06/10/2023
"the delivery was spot on time and date. although the items delivered did not meet my personal expectations as per size, feel and quality as shown per the photos in the website. but still that was me ????. however the items delivered were exactly as described within the site and iam happy.",4,06/10/2023
No option of no stars. All the reviews are fake and paid for. They take your money and tell you nothing but lies. FAKE DONT USE THIS SITE.,1,06/10/2023
I've been shopping in Temu quite a few times and enjoyed the products that I have bought and contributing to the free gifts activity however when I wanted to open the free gifts activity it goes its no longer in my country which is the UK which is a real shame if you ask me. But other than that best app to use,4,07/10/2023
"For me TEMU is very serious, I even felt ashamed they gave me a NIS20 credit because my purchase arrived ONE day !  later than they had estimated. Prices are very cheap to reasonable and the quality is superior than the Big Brother that I definitely left for TEMU and could not have done anything better.",5,07/10/2023
"I order from Temu (Ireland) often enough :) The prints are typically nice, very close to the pictures (surprisingly so), however the material is very cheap and thin (even for sweaters, it's super thin). BUT for this price? You don't expect superb quality, so I'm mostly okay with those. Of course, always look closely at the item and use your common sense :)Another thing I like about Temu is the delivery terms. Free delivery, clear deadlines, and if you don't get the item on time, even if it's a day late, you get a voucher for the next item. And the refunds are also super easy, no questions asked!So 4* only for not-the-best quality, but as to all the rest? I'm super satisfied. I'll definitely proceed to shop on Temu.",4,07/10/2023
ABSOLUTELY AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE - RETURNED WATCH VIA PRE-APPROVED LABEL WITH OTHER ITEMS. THEY STATED WATCH WAS NOT RETURNED ALTHOUGH DID STATE THAT 'PERSONAL ITEM' WAS DISCOVERED ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED FURTHER DESPITE NUMEROUS REQUESTS. AVOID !!!!,1,07/10/2023
"It's flimsy plastic stuff made in China. The photos make items look bigger than they are, that said they do give measurements in the description. I didn't check the measurements as I expected the photo to be representative.  And finally I've been inundated with spam since signing up.  I have uninstalled temu and do not recommend.",3,07/10/2023
An extraordinary waste of planet resources...zillions of meaningless and useless item in all shapes and materials and colours. No respect for recycling and sustainability. Just manufacture and sell. In this day and age this is absolutely irresponsible. Stop Oil should pay a visit rather than gluing themselves to clean Britain. Most items are splendidly presented and on receipt they prove disappointing and useless. Someone must stop this insane and extremist consumerism and get it back to a sustainable level.,1,07/10/2023
"Happy with the service though I have a lot of items that had to go in the bin,,,but for the price my expectations must have been high reason for 4 stars is at the moment I am waiting on nearly ??30 refund for cancelled items weeks ago...these cancellations where 1 for price changing by ??4 at the point of checking out and 2 ordered wrongly ALL were cancelled immediately also because of Temus popularity taking longer now to arrive...and you need to check description carefully ...the saying that all that glistens isn't gold....",4,07/10/2023
The platform works ok! but the app drives me mad ! ping pong ! Noises every few minutes prompting you !  in which you cannot switch  off ! No matter what ! Only way is delete the app ! They need to stop this feature its driving people away the other Chinese  platform are the same so I delete them when not looking to buy then reload app to buy item then delete the app again is the only way !,1,07/10/2023
Got the wrong order and Temu refuses to help!I placed order PO-037-08025373553273380-D01 and at first I didn?€?t even receive it. I told Temu and a day later I got a package with stuff I never ordered! Now Temu doesn?€?t want to help me! Worst customer service!,1,07/10/2023
Temu sells a wide range of items but they are all very cheap and fall apart. They loose your order but won't refund for 3weeks just incase it arrives. Do Not Trust a Word they say. The below reply is not worth anything as the products you sell. They are so cheap I just throw them away or recycle them. I did expect the quality would be poor but not the service. I won't forgive you for leading me up a garden path just to find out if my order has been despatched. So many lies it's not acceptable,1,07/10/2023
"I can?€?t say enough good things them. They were using Deliver-It which is a scam shipping company and I complained to them that the tracking hadn?€?t been updated in days and my items were taking much longer than any other packages I'd ever ordered, and all because of Deliver-It, the scam shipping company they use. I hope they stop using Deliver-It. Be aware if you live in SoCal, Arizona or Nevada that Temu might use Deliver-It. You must tell customer support Deliver-It is a scam ship company and take screenshots of reviews of the company from Better Business Bureau website. Let's put Deliver-It out of business. I screenshotted reviews of this deplorable shipping company from the Better Business Bureau?€?s website to show Deliver-It isn?€?t accredited and has an F rating and only negative reviews for years and years. Temu quickly refunded my money and got the company to move their a$$ and deliver my package. Temu also does price adjustments which is good! They'll refund you if an item you bought becomes cheaper right after you bought it. I don't like the long wait for my items, but that's expected since they're probably coming from China.",5,07/10/2023
Thieves! Missed 2 items out my order and will not refund or replace missing items. If you want to have your money stolen this is the place to go! Cannot provide evidence of what was in the parcel and have the worst customer service I?€?ve ever come across,1,07/10/2023
"I don't even have the merchandise to give an honest opinion of the quality.  The problem is with the shipping company, HAILIFY, that they use.  There are numerous complaints about this company, and now I have my own experience to add.  My package was 'delivered' at 10:15 am (they took a picture) and was gone by 10:30 am.  No doorbell rung, no delivery time estimate, NOTHING.  Package was GONE.  So many complaints re: this delivery company.",1,07/10/2023

"Despite negative comments from friends and family, I am an avid Temu shopper. There have been times when the product wasn?€?t as great as I?€?d like, but Customer Service always made good.

The shipping is free and if you need to return your order, they are very responsible in getting what needs to be done. I will continue using Temu. It's a fun way to shop and has a VERY large amount of different items to choose from. Items you've seen all over will be at Temu and at 1/2 the price.",5,08/10/2023

Don't waste your money.EDIT.Now Temu are harassing me via trustpilot, they are claiming my review is not genuine, so in effect they are calling me a liar.

After contacting Temu, they were still unable to tell me why the order was cancelled, and customer service was so unhelpful just copy-pasting policies that have no relevance to my issue. If my order was cancelled during the hold, the funds should return immediately, WHY was I actually charged?! Stay away from these scammers.",1,08/10/2023

"After seeing lots of negative comments on social media about Temu I was very sceptical about placing an order but thought that if I pay via PayPal I have their protection so I went ahead and ordered the Nano tape and some King Size bedding. The Nano tape was, I expect, a copy of the real thing as it was in a plain plastic bag but it works just as well and is a fraction of the price. The bedding is lovely but is a lot larger than my other kingsize bedding. The pillow cases are the width of nearly 2 pillows and I suspect the quilt cover is a superking and not a kingsize. The quality of the bedding is however very good and it is a lovely soft cotton - instead of buttons at the bottom of the cover it is a zip, which I like. Rather than return for the correct size I will just get my sewing machine out and alter them. I can probably make a matching cushion cover with the excess fabric. Delivery was also quicker than expected.",5,08/10/2023
"Cheap product and worst delivery service. Price is very cheap compared to Amazon but delivery takes many weeks and the worst part,  DPD the partner carrier will leave you package in a pick up station and maybe never tried to deliver in  your home address.",1,08/10/2023
"I've actually no had any problems with this company or deliveries so far. Couple of times had issues with a faulty or damaged item but they rectify it more efficient than most. However, signing up for mails and messages......they can be a bit high volume. But you can easily rectify that yourself.Packing is not bad at all considering. It is well packed. It is also convenient when you can track and divert. That always helps. My shop is across the road from my home. Parcels are vaccum packed so not as massive to get picked up as you think. So far...all is still going well. Positive. And my Step Dad has started using and hasn't had a problem so far either. Will continue to shop happily",5,08/10/2023

Yes, some reflect the cheap price, but they can then be refunded.I need to do more research on their ethical standpoint though, as that does concern me.",5,09/10/2023
"my third order, i find most things are good, like with any online orders there are things not worth the money but if you check before buying its a good thing, the only thing is you have to wait at least a week but their tracking is very good",4,09/10/2023
I just received a broken item from Temu.  I reported it to them and they credited my account and did NOT require that I send it back.  I've also had one item a day late and was credited with $US dollars.  Some of the things they sell are obviously crap but they seem to stand behind what they sell.,4,09/10/2023

"I can't get a refund without sending back a broken item that was $1.59. It costs me $2.48 for a return label Everytime I have had to send something back. It would be stupid to send it back. In the 9 months I have been dealing with Temu I have spent a few thousand dollars with them, and I can't receive a $1.59 refund without sending it back. If you want proof that the necklace is broken, I can send you a photo. I just received the item yesterday and it was broken before I received it. It came out of the package broken. All the time I have dealt with you I have gotten quite a few things broken in the mail. I have a sensor activated lights, and out of the 2 I received one didn't work. I have a USB strip that holds 7 charger cables I received not long ago and half of the plugs don't work, and I haven't called about those because they didn't cost much either, but how many of your defective products do I have to suffer for. With all the money I have spent with you people, and I can't get a refund for that little bit of money. I am done dealing with Temu. I have been sending everything back that you have asked for, but I am not going to pay another $1.41 on top of the $159 I paid for it. I have no problem sending all of the broken things that I am sitting on now for a refund if you would pay for the shipping, but I would be stupid to put more money on top of what I have already paid for a refund that I am not really getting back at all.",1,09/10/2023
"A selling platform completely ruined by gamification.What could have been a great app (and website) has been ruined by turning everything into a game and giving the impression you?€?re winning discounts. Constant pop-ups telling you that you?€?re the luckiest person as you somehow always manage to win the biggest discount etc. The designers must really think we?€?re all stupid.However what really shows this app is a complete con are the games which are near-impossible to win, such as Fishland which tempts you with free gifts - it appears it?€?s easy or might require some effort, but you don?€?t realise it?€?ll cost you HUNDREDS OF POUNDS and require signing up 50+ new users to even get close to getting the items it suggests you?€?re going to get quite easily.

"Having looked at some reviews before I placed my first order I have to confess that I was nervous. My fears proved groundless - I have now placed four orders and have been very impressed on each occasion.OK, let's be honest you get what you pay for, but the prices are exceptionally good! Delivery has always been well within the stated window, and all items have been complete and unbroken. The descriptions have also been accurate, and the user reviews appear to be genuine.One slightly negative comment would be that all my orders have been shipped in plastic bags without any protective packaging. It is therefore inevitable that any cardboard boxes included for individual items will have been crushed during their journey from China. I would therefore be cautious about buying fragile items, or if the packaging will require to be undamaged for a gift.Overall very happy, and I'm sure I'll be using Temu again soon (they're a bit addictive)!",5,10/10/2023
Always kept me updated on the order and delivery status via SMS and email.Very punctual. The goods delivered were in great condition and correct size.,5,10/10/2023
I have made lots of orders from Temu. The last two orders has gone to a different place for delivery. I have to take two buses to pick up my packages and now I am waiting two more that is the same delivery place. i have contact DB Schenker and they told me that Temu is responsible to change the place that I will pick up my packages.  I talked to Temu within chat and they told me that DB Schenker needs to change it. So either you are not talking to each other or you are joking with the customers. I don't understand why there is no option to choose yourself the place of the delivery. I have two places of DB Schenker next to my house and they have send it to other side of the area.Unfortunately I will stop order from temu until they understand that the delivery is not right.,1,10/10/2023
I brought a lot of items such as PAJAMS Gloves and socks from temu it was a fast shipping and they all came in good condition I was very pleased but one item was missing which was a bracelet but I contacted customer service and they were very quick and friendly and gave a reshipment for the item,4,10/10/2023
"I recently placed and order from temu for the first time.  NEVER AGAIN.I received my order the quality of clothing was appalling they where flimsy and looked nothing like the pictures.I ordered a shoe rack which was nothing at all like advertised.As you can imagine everything got sent back baring the water bottles.Anyway moving forward temu have advertised that all of my order which I returned was not processed and explained that I owe them ??60.00 for water bottles.I mean really you have to laugh????.I have been communicating with them via message but I am going round in circles, it is driving me insane.The kids love the water bottles, but not worth ??60.00.My advise be weary ordering from this company.",1,10/10/2023
"I returned a large order over ??90 worth of clothes, Temu only refunded me ??37 stating that all items did not reach them. I do not know if Evri had tampered with the package or if Temu are plugging a fast one. I have raised a case via Temu and I am waiting for a response. I have also raised this to PayPal. I have not had issues with Temu for small orders however this large order has turned out to be stressful.",1,10/10/2023

"I was pretty worried after I read all the reviews on here since I had already ordered quite alot of stuff from Temu. I have to say, I had no problems at all! I was updated every step of the way with my order and it's delivery. I think the price reflects the quality and in saying that the quality is ALOT better than I originally thought it would be. I'm actually quite impressed. Everything I bought was true to pictures and description. Will use again in future!",5,10/10/2023
I like to make and fill my own christmas crackers but over the last few years it has become harder and harder to find nice things that both fit inside and are affordable. Temu has put an end to that with a plethora of brilliant affordable items. The o ly downside is that there are do many other things that I can't stop ordering.,5,10/10/2023
"The colours on the pictures do not match the colours of the actual product.

The quality of the clothing isn?€?t to good however everything else is so amazing,4,10/10/2023
"It looks very cheap. I got some items, and they are OK. However, their marketing is very unethical and misleading. What is sold on the mobile app is more expensive (the same item) compared to the Temu internet website. On the mobile app, there is a random wheel popup to win a voucher. The first time, the wheel took me to another chance. The second time, I won 150.00 if I spent $15.00. I then went ahead and ordered, and when the cart was just above $15.00, it prompted me to pay for the items, which I did. Then, instead of giving me $150.00 to spend, they have various categories to choose from. If you spend $40.00, then 20%, some discount, and so on. It is really a fib, a misleading promotion. Don't get caught. The prices are high in the mobile app anyway compared to their website.",2,11/10/2023
"My experience with Temu is very bad.Never get any delivery.I have now submitted orders a total of five times.I never received the goods. The update is OK, but no delivery is coming. The delivery is apparently made with a company Ctt express.On the update it says: ""Deliveries are today."" No delivery arrives.Further update: ""Delivery fails""I have not been able to leave the house for several days while waiting for the package. No one has attempted to deliver anything. The first order I made was delivered by Correos. This order went well, and therefore I tried further with more orders. This has caused so much frustration and wasted days that I have now decided to try another mail order company. For two months I have tried and have now given up.The date I have inserted applies to the last package that was not delivered. Started the first of my five  orders September 13, 2023. Hello again Temu.Referring to your reply:""If the tracking status is not updated within 15 days, you can request a full refund and keep the item when it arrives. If your order arrives late, we will issue a credit of ???5 (standard shipping) or a credit of ???8 (express shipping) to your account as a small token of appreciation for your patience. Finally, Temu's Purchase Protection program offers a full refund if your items do not arrive.""This is the same answer I have always received when I have requested my packages. My problem is that the goods never arrived.Refund is fine, but I want items. I would like information on why this happens with each order delivery. I have now attempted 6 orders without a single delivery from CTT express. Could someone be stealing my items?",1,11/10/2023

"Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of having my parcel sent to the wrong place on my first order. There was no help from TEMU or Evri to change the address. It doesn't make sense for it to have been sent to another address when making the purchase I chose the same address as the payment method. I have an order that has already been sent and I have not yet been able to change the address to the correct one, which again makes my experience with this frustrating. The part about the delay in receiving the refund and having to wait to get to the delivery center is ridiculous.The lack of support is very frustrating. I hope that after this feedback something can be done so that you don't disappoint other people.kind regards.",1,11/10/2023

Was so surprised they were stainless steel. Great buy. All in all am extremely impressed with the quality of goods and how fast they shipped.

"I've bought from Temu twice. At first I had my doubts because the humongous amounts of fake sites around. I am well and truly satisfied. Things are what they are supposed to be and mostly look like the website pic. Prices are very good and in addition delivery is very fast, if you take in account it's coming from China. Much faster than Ali express. FYI, I bought mostly knitting and sewing items. So, I recommend it. For my part, I'll be purchasing again.",5,12/10/2023

For low stakes items such as pencil holders, rags, organizers, scissors, etc it is not bad at all - often even having the same manufacturer as the equivalent products on Amazon, but at 1/5 the price. I would avoid for clothes and for more expensive items, especially electrical items - some of them didn't even turn on. Fortunately the return policy is very reasonable.Shipping takes 2-3 weeks but they do eventually arrive. And there are updates at every touchpoint.",4,12/10/2023
Ordered 6 items they all wrong is sizes colours and material. I suppose that's what you get when you order cheap. I won't ever order again. Cooker rack arrived broken. Rugs I ordered are tiny and the other items not fit for purpose just bin. No point trying to return them. I just won't order again. So stay clear of TEMU......,1,12/10/2023
They've stole my moneyUsed multiple times with no problem until I placed a bigger order worth hundreds of pounds. According to royal mail it was never sent to them for delivery. Tracking is fake!Everytime I ask for my refund they ask me to wait another 7 days. For what exactly a parcel I'll never recieve because it was never sent. Chargeback opened with my bank. Using every excuse not to send the goods or refund my money.Lesson learned this time,1,12/10/2023
I am kinda embarrassed at an incident where I had accused Temu of retaking a refund which where actually I was at fault.This is a genuine apology as they did everything possible to rectify the issue. They did not give up until I did...All the orders I have made have been on time & the cost is the quality I expect for the price. (No they didn't ask me to add that) Enjoy Temu everyone....it's actually better than you think ????,5,12/10/2023
"Some of the stuff was rubbish. Now, it's possible they have some useful stuff but how would you find it on the website. The website is ridiculous its just a great big jumble of everything, designed to confuse the  customer with items ticked already. If you don't untick you will end up with things you will be charged for and didn't want.I would not recommend leaving Credit Card details on your account for that reason.Probably what I'm trying to say is that it's not a comfortable experience buying on Temu.",1,12/10/2023

They didn't listen and asked me questions about the add that I had no means of answering but they must have been able to find themself (they got an screndump of the price announcement)?It must have been a scam - and I'm surprised they can continue with that kind of advertisement without ever fullfilling their promise!",1,13/10/2023
I have ordered 2 item with Temu to experience the quality of their produce and standard of service.My first big problem is having to wait at least 3 weeks for any product to arrive.

Have tried to track order but told NEW TRACKING UPDATE FOR YOUR PACKAGES IS NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO LIMITED FLIGHTS. MY PACKAGE IS CURRENTLY WAITING AT THE AIRPORT.I can only conclude that those who are prepared to wait potentially up to 30 working days for their purchases are welcome to do so but I am not.

I have bought over 100 products by now and most of them have been really good experiences. The support team are super helpful when it comes to delayed packages and what not.The quality of the products can be dodgy at times but it's really got to do with your own discretion and whether or not you look at the reviews first. I have not experienced any scams or any unfair treatment I have only had good experiences. I even got a few Christmas presents for my family especially because of all the silly gifts you can buy.I've went through a lot of genres on Temu such as makeup, stationary, storage etc, and it's been great, if I have ever had a problem and an item broke they always give refunds and sometimes you don't even have to return the item so it saves a lot of time for the buyer.

........ AVOID TEMU..... Temu sent me nothing but excusesPlaced my very first Order on 4th November for 7 items and received NOTHING... endless excuses as to delivery problems etc and still no further forward..TO DATE having contacted them on four separate occasions they have provided me with no credible evidence of my order actually being sent..I have Now reported this matter to my card provider for a refund as I believe I have been scammed by them..Total scam,1,14/10/2023
"Temu have a terrible customer service and quality of their products is very low. Please do NOT purchase from this company. I returned products which was checked by their warehouse and sent back in the same package as another return (they request this to cut costs). They refused to refund and I opened a case with PayPal, to date they have not to refunded me. Delete the Temu app it?€?s a load of nonsense they provide low quality items and I have heard from YouTube US customers your data is at risk! I would give this company zero stars beware of this company buyers! Cheaper products not worth the risk buy from a reputable uk company. For simply stating they are the best in the marketplace and offer affordable prices and quality goods, doesn?€?t magically make the quality of the products any better. If the refund were as simple as a button then why after two months and still not refund me or give me credit on the account. The 90 day guarantee does not work. I deleted the app and yet all my private data is held for further processing, for what purpose?? I will not go back to reinstall this app as this will reinstate the account with Temu and I don?€?t want any other customers to be trapped and put into the same situation as me. Please read other views regarding this company and watch the YouTube feedback videos about this company, to guarantee you are not caught out like me.",1,14/10/2023

"Soooo much faster & better app than AliExpress. I?€?ve had no issues with deliveries, BUT I usually purchase items like makeup & jewellery etc, rarely clothes. I believe most of the clothes are poor quality like spandex and not the same quality as advertised - but, unlike other sites, you can see both the ad pic and the actual clothing & its quality in the gallery. There are also many reviews with customer pics you should look for. The app works fluently, i love that you can place & pay an order but you can purchase more stuff after that (at least like 8hours) and you get the additional items included with the original purchase. And unlike AliExpress, you rarely have to pay a lot of delivery fees. I?€?ve bought soooo many arts&crafts, makeup, beauty products and jewellery items from Temu 80-90% cheaper than from local stores, and they are just as good a quality. And delivery time is usually around a week, so i don?€?t have to wait a long time for the products to arrive. I love it!",4,15/10/2023

I am pleased with everything I ordered from temu. The items took about 9 days to arrive and the expected time was about 9 to 15 days so not bad. Not bad at all.

They do not keep your information secure. They have mentioned below that they are PCI compliant, but this is something that only relates to how they handle credit card information, and not your personal information.

"I've never had any issues with TemuI've never had any issues with Temu. yes they take a little longer to get to me, but the items are always worth the wait, my advice is always read the items description properly , to save disappointment, and take a look at the reviews with real item pictures, so you know what your getting, luckily I've never had to return any items so I can't comment on how easy/hard that maybe.  One time Evri messed up with my delivery,  but temu sorted it with no problem , and I received replacment items in no time, Temu also offer a  ??5 reward if your parcel doesn't get to you by a set date,",5,16/10/2023
Never got bad experience using Temu from Denmark. The only bad experience was my earring never came but I submitted for a refund and they refunded my money within 24 hours without any issue/drama. So satisfied and definitely worth the wait & money.,5,17/10/2023

This is causing me a lot of stress, and I state again I have NEVER used, or ordered anything from either Temu, or T??mu.As stated previously, I blocked, deleted all emails received from T??mu, but I am still receiving their emails.I used your email address Temu.com, for advice , and the email isn't recognised.Better still what is your UK telephone number?Thank you.",1,17/10/2023

"I have made many orders with Temu. Big and smaller orders. They are mainly plastic/glass boxes, jewellery related products, and a couple of household items. Nothing wrong so far. They pack fragile items very securely although other items may just be put in a plastic bag. Some times I needed to search for the corners of the bags to get some tiny beads out. But it is understandable if something has travelled all the way from China to the UK, they move around. Packages have always arrived in time as promised. I have never received any promotional emails even not in my junk folder. I have all my details on the app. I do see their ads on other social media platforms but there are places for ads anyway. Regarding games, I am not interested in earning free products as I am only looking for what I need, not what is free.Temu provides detailed tracking system straightafter your order. They tell you when the items are packed, shipped, on flight, arrived in the UK, custom cleared and received by Evri. Then they send a couple of emails to inform me that I will receive my order soon. This process is actually quite touching. I had no issue with lost items either. Two points to make though, one pair of earrings had one missing by packing error, which I did not claim; another is more important: I bought some 925 sterling silver earrings as per description. However, the earrings stick to magnet. I provided one star review to that particular seller. Hence, I gave a 4-star review now. Temu is reviewing that review.  Let's see if the truth can be released. All and all, I admire what Temu offers. It is not easy to regulate that many sellers in Greater China. There will be pros and cons to get lower priced products in these inflated markets. In a way, supporting a young company is sensible. I hope Temu can resolve issues raised by the lower-star raters so that the company can grow and compete globally. It is fun to shop with Temu!",4,17/10/2023
"After negative experiences with aliexpress, I was sceptical towards temu. But I am shocked about how good they are! I have already placed a few orders and each time the items came very quick (one order with slight delay, which I didn't even realize, but got a discount due to it), good quality, all delivered to pickup location without issues (DHL packstation), very good experience with returns. Many thanks!",5,17/10/2023
Sick of this bunch of fools. My wife and I get AT LEAST 12 emails A DAY. Fortunately they go into junk automatically but we cannot stop them arriving! Nothing but a damn nuisance. Funny thing is we have NEVER bought anything from them AND NEVER EVER EVER WOULD. IF YOU WANT JUNK EMAILS THEN YOU WILL BE IN HEAVEN.Further to your reply: I suggest you look at some of your reviews. My case is most definitely NOT out of the norm. A great many people are fed up getting UNSOLICITED emails from Temu. Also I never reached out! It is impossible to get through to you conventionally. The only thing left was for me to leave a review. I have now sent you about a dozen emails I received. When you want a further fifty let me know. Doubtless if you reply again it will be to tell me the emails are not from Temu. I expect no less!,1,17/10/2023
"Temu keep bombarding you with email offers and deals based on your previous searches, but when you try to apply these they are misleading as the picture, price & description of the -- A Big Surprise especially for YOU! -- offer is clearly a description for the main product, but the actual offer is for some minor accessory / auxiliary item connected with the main item!Basically the item showed at 39Kc for x2 pieces in the under 46kc section which would have been a fantastic offer I know as they do come on sometimes, but when you select the size it goes up to 940Kc for 2!!When you inform their customer services you are transferred x3 times to different colleagues, they then try to say there are certain conditions within the advert that apply only like - only top left items are applicable - which is not actually stated in the advert, so they were incorrect again! They then finally send an email saying they are grateful for the information, which is what I assume is a regular used template as they forget to delete & adjust - At [Company Name] - So just a friendly word of warning with this site as to ensure the correct selection is showing before you purchase or you simply waste a lot of your time and energy.There are & were many similar incorrectly advertised items on their site and offer emails, so very misleading to the customer!Happy shopping all.",1,17/10/2023

I was very pleased with my purchases from Temu. I got exactly what I wanted at fabulous prices as described. Today I tried to purchase more items but as I pressed ?€?pay?€? I was informed that I couldn?€?t buy the articles as I am in a dispute with them! ?????€???€???. News to me,4,18/10/2023
"I'll say 4 stars because there are items where things come that I don't expect, some pictures are misleading in some ways so make sure you read the descriptions. But overall I actually really like the items I've ordered and haven't found fault with anything. That being said I've ordered all small items such as teddies, led lights for round the TV, stick on nails and earrings. A Christmas ornament and also eyeshadow were the 2 items that came that weren't what I expected but I still really like them. I've placed 3 or 4 orders with them.",4,18/10/2023
"I ordered a few small items to test out this company as was rather sceptical but all arrived as described.  Delivery takes a couple of weeks, but that was not an issue and tracking was provided.

I was very unsure about ordering thru this site and boy was I glad I did. I?€?ve made 4 orders of 15 items or more and I am so impressed with the quality of every single item. It?€?s not junk like I thought it would be. They are quick to deliver and returns are SO EASY!! They send you a return label?€?no questions asked and your Visa is credited within a week. The amount of items that they have for sell is unbelievable! You can spend hours on this site and definitely find tons of Xmas gifts. So glad I gave it a try. Thanks Temu!,5,18/10/2023

So far, I?€?d say 75% of the things I?€?ve ordered have been really good, especially when you take into account how cheap everything was. But, there?€?s a few items that have been almost laughable - the quality was so bad ( household items). They do offer one refund without sending the item back ( you need to supply photographs obviously).

"I placed an order on November 10, and today, 8 days later, it was delivered straight to my home. The delivery was carried out by the Colis Prive courier service, which was unknown to me until this day. Usually delivery in Belgium is carried out only on weekdays, which is not convenient since I am always at work and cannot receive the order directly. You have to pick it up from the point of issue. But Colis Prive delivered it on a weekend at 16.00. Honestly, I'm surprised. The only caveat is that I did not receive a notification about the approximate day and time of delivery. The last notification was that my parcel had been transferred to the courier service and would be delivered soon. To tell you the truth, before this I was skeptical and placed an order just out of curiosity, but everything went smoothly. I think I?€?ll definitely order something else from Temu)",5,19/10/2023
"I've had mostly good experiences using Temu.  The products arrive generally in about 10 days.  They can be 99 cent store quality but often better. I'm using a handbag that I got for 76 cents as a come on promo.  They've credited returns promptly, even telling me to keep the items and give them to charity.  My biggest gripe with Temu is that immediately after ordering, my email inbox is flooded with phishing emails, often purporting to be from them.  Their website is clearly not 100% safe and I always use PayPal, never a credit card.",4,19/10/2023
Never had a bad experience with Temu! Yes it's annoying with all the notifications but they can be easily turned off. Sometimes packaging is damaged as there is no protection wrapper but it doesn't affect the use in any way. I've ordered from them over 10 separate times now and my orders have always been on time. Keep up the great work!,5,19/10/2023
Its a scam with the 5 items that you get for free if you invite new members in 24h. For this Ill not buy anything from Temu! Bad jokes from bad people!!! Shame on you!!! Ohh you haven't !,1,19/10/2023
"Total scam. Did not receive package even though it?€?s marked delivered in their app. Reached out to customer support and they just say to double check, refusing to provide a resolution (ie reship/refund). Basically getting charged without receiving the products.Reply to Temu's Response: I reached out to Temu Customer Support multiple times, including 2 tickets created, and the response was basically meaning ""go find it yourself we won't provide a resolution"". Both ticket responses were like that. It's completely ridiculous getting charged for a shipment I did not receive. To those reading this: DO NOT trust their so called free return if shipment is lost policy - totally untrue.Update: I reached out to customer service one last time after Temu replied here and received the same response. No resolution, still got charged for missing package. Buy from Aliexpress Shein or Amazon, don?€?t trust Temu.",1,19/10/2023

While the things l bought from Temu are ok l now get heaps of spam emails from different companies which are no doubt attached to the site.. l have received up to 80 emails from companies in one day with no emails addresses some with the name Temu associated to it..So l will no longer buy from them...,2,19/10/2023
Temu is great appart from when they split up your order into two packages and one gets sent by royal mail which is fine but othwr by evri wich is always late and nearly a joke to track because they dont have a clue all in all order with Amazon for faster and more reliable shipping,4,19/10/2023

Also the Christmas decorations where damaged but got them refunded instantly also. I have won 3 gifts from them which was hard work and harassing my friends to download the app. But I did get my drone, robot hoover and bath toy. Which all seem great so far. Some things do feel cheap and somethings are good quality. Some things are a lot cheaper when comparing to other sites. The games are addictive and I?€?m close to winning my next free prizes. Emails can be turned off in settings so your not getting 200s of emails a day which is a downside as they over advertise this way. I just turned off email notifications. Overall I like the site. Just seems like a Amazon to me. But with free delivery. So far no major issues. I did use a link through Facebook first which was a scam link, I realised and closed it instantly.",4,19/10/2023

They are expecting me to return it however I live remotely so I do not have access to a near by post office, I explained this to which I got no sense from customer service. I've wasted nearly 100 pounds on this app all to be scammed. Stay away from it. I know it's cheap and lovely but if you do ever get an issue, their customer service seem to be unable to deal with anything. Steer clear.I've noticed temu has responded to this as well, yet again telling me exactly what customer service was telling me (that has nothing to do with what I am saying)Clearly not listening or reading their complaints properly AT ALL. Temu please take your customers more seriously.",1,20/10/2023

"3 things missing from my order, got double of one item! Packaging for those that did arrive looks as though they've been kicked around!

"I had used Wish before, I know Temu seems to have been tarred with the same brush. I gave it a go at the start of summer 2023, up to now, I have bought over 200 items. Out of those 200 things, just 2 have been bad quality, if you complain, a refund is offered immediately, no fuss. If you use PayPal, it's quick and easy. I love Temu, I'm enjoying looking at all the great stuff, comparing it all against the prices on Amazon and getting the same quality for sometimes half the price.",5,20/10/2023

Amazing. I have never been into buying cheap stuff but given that we all buy these same things from other sellers who put up a few 100%s premium in price.  I?€?m all in now on Temu. Thank you Temu!!!,5,20/10/2023
"Every item I ordered did arrive and was on time. Customer service is friendly. The only problem I had with Temu is disorganization when having to  return some items. I did receive my refunds in a timely manner. The quality and material on some of the dresses was not to my liking, but   Everything else seems to be legit with Temu. I will continue to do business.",4,20/10/2023

Temu are great but don't expect top quality on everything you get. As long as you take this into consideratio. Most things I received have been on the much pretty damn good or better than expected. For example got pair of trainers for ??10 look like pair of Skechers at a fraction of the cost. I can go through a pair of Skechers in a year so how many pairs of these look alikes can I get. p.s had them for 3 months so far and still going strong.,5,20/10/2023
Please be aware. This company sells your data to scammers. I was quite pleased with purchases I made from them but shortly after I was bombarded with scam emails purporting to be from Temu. The products are cheap but really not worth the follow up. I?€?ve reported them for GDPR violations,1,20/10/2023
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SITEDelivery company have said they have delivered my package but.ive not received it. Temu refusing to refund for lost package I've spent over ??150 on this order so I'm now out of pocket with no package.... once they have your money there not interested,1,20/10/2023

Don?€?t have to be in a hurry for deliveries- the figures they sate are obviously made up. When try to find out where they are met with same bog standard answer which are obviously same give to everyone - once /if my orders arrive will be very wary of ordering anything else As for their reply about contacting them through their chat - which I did you get the same bog sorry for the inconvenience answer and was even told you just have to wait for your parcel,1,21/10/2023
Everything turned up on time. I'd say the products were of mixed quality but this largely corresponded to the price and I overall felt I'd got a good deal overall. Obviously the delivery time is quite slow but you're paying very low prices so this seems like a fair exchange. They are marketed on their pricing but I actually think the really impressive thing about Temu is the range of goods they sell.,5,21/10/2023
Can you let me know if part of your company is selling load's of stuff off for ??2 a go.. I was on Facebook and an ad came on from temu selling pallets of stock for ??2. Is this an advert from temu or is somebody trying to scam them!,1,21/10/2023

YOU DO NOT LISTEN - YOU SEND GENERATED REPLIES",1,22/10/2023
I just received part of my order.1st-  Very badly packed. 2nd only 1 item out 10 is usable.... the other 9 absolute rubbish. Nothing is worth a penny.I'm sure we pay for the delivery not for items.,1,22/10/2023
Package arrived and everything is great but beware they sell your emails you will get an influx of emails non stop. Or give them an email you don't use.You can't block the spam emails either as they do it through your own account and hack it.,1,22/10/2023

"I have ordered a few things, one of my orders had 3 pair of sneakers in it. 2 of them did not fit. I sent them back via my local UPS Store. I have the receipts, I also got and email for each pair from TEMU saying items were received at the warehouse! They are denying 1 of my refunds saying it was not received at the warehouse. I have chatted with them & written them and they say they can't help me even though I PROVED IT!! I would have kept the shoes and worn them to small if I knew they would do this to me. $18 is $18! If I could give 0 stars I would.I would like to add that they will probably respond saying they want to help me and they will follow up and they pride themselves on the customer service but I have the whole chat saved or they kept telling me they can?€?t refund me the warehouse does not have the item. Again, I have the emails and the receipt from UPS to prove both items sent .UPDATE: as usual they responded to this with customer service is of utmost importance & they will follow up & to pleaaw reach our ALL UNTRUE. I reached out via chat cause tgata all you can do the rep kept telling me there is nothing tgey can do and would NOT GET ME A SUPERVISOR. This company is a FRAUD",1,22/10/2023

"I'm changing this review to be fair on all ends.  I've placed 3 orders with Temu.  The first order was delayed.  A week later, the second order was delayed.  I was happy with the merchandise when the package finally arrived.  The shipping process is already long enough and both my first two orders were delayed.  A bit frustrating. I placed a third order, I decided to pay for express shipping hoping items would arrive sooner and not be delayed.  Again, this order was delayed as well.  In fact, tracking had stopped for days and no one at Temu was able to investigate this. I contacted customer service 2 times to ask to investigate why my package was not moving in tracking.  They were not able to tell me much.  A day after the item was supposed to arrive and still no delivery, I contacted Temu again and requested a refund.  I was pretty frustrated that even with express shipping, this was another order delayed and somewhere in limbo. I needed the items by a certain date and they didn't arrive.  In Temu's favor, my refund request was expedited faster than I expected. I would have rather received my items but at least the refund process was speedy.  This at least restored my faith in Temu's customer service.   The bottom line, delivery takes a while and don't count on items arriving when they are supposed to.  There is a good chance, your package will be delayed.  Paying extra for express shipping doesn't help speed up delivery.  Shipping dates are unreliable.  The merchandise is equal quality to anything we may buy online or in local stores and I was pleasantly surprised by that.  I ordered mostly holiday decorations.  Customer service provided my refund quickly.",4,22/10/2023
Package never arrived. Over $200 worth which courier Fast Horse said they delivered at 11pm at night (a property directly opening to a street in a business area).  The courier took a photo of the doorway and separate photo of the package. We examined security camera footage. The courier is a liar. No package was ever left Temu said they would investigate but never replied. There is NO WAY TO CHOOSE YOUR DELIVERY SERVICE. Both companies need investigation. Especially Fast Horse Couriers by the Police?€? the company Temu insists on using.,1,22/10/2023
not easy to get replies once you place an order hope it arrives and they seem to sell your details to scammers who pretend to be temu offering free items  once you pay change your paypal or other passwords as they will probably sell that too   They sent me a message  saying they don't and I still got fake temu offers and delivery attempts by fake temu company.  They do sell your detail to criminals and don't ask who they are to stop it happening,1,22/10/2023
"Items are cheaper than other retail shops & they have quirky items not available in UK. Generally the items I bought were unexpectedly good although their delivery time is not speedy - It takes too long for items to arrive, the same with their refund process. I am sure Temu is fully aware banks in UK process refunds received very quickly. I am still waiting for a refund processed on 8 November. Come on Temu, I am sure you are an efficient company, so speed up your delivery & refund process.Updated on 17 November- 5 working days is too long. I still have not received my refund. Temu was mentioned in BBC news this morning. Temu you do need to do better",4,23/10/2023

They sent me a partial refund of six returned items, & I am still waiting for them to credit me the balance, since they requested I send all the return items together that I was returning.  Terrible experience WILL NEVER AGAIN PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. I had a text conversation with someone regarding this issue, & that was no help at all.

Most of the items are completely rubbish. Waste of money. Avoid buying from temu. You can buy better products in the UK.,1,23/10/2023
Had no interaction with this company but have been receiving about 5 emails a day from them for random stuff. No idea where they got my email but I?€?ll never shop with them for that reason alone,1,23/10/2023

"I was dubious about Temu in the beginning but after my 6th order I can recommend Temu. I have had no issues with my orders, everything arrived effortlessly. Prices speak for themselves and quality is exactly what is described. I tested their customer service response with a question and they answered quickly. I have ordered Christmas boxes, wrapping, tags and clothes. I do recommend that you look at star ratings/reviews - anything 4-stars and more is dependable quality.

I rate TEMU 4 starts cuz not their faul but the USA post service delivery my package to a random street. Whoever not even 5 hours and I got full refund in store credit ! So easy! I been using TEMU for the past 3 years never had an issue! The quality of products are amazing! I never question the honesty cuz I paid with installments from another app and they can get access to my main payment source! Never got issues of emails or any others! Bummer they lost this last package I would love to have it today! Witch is way earlier then the date they promised. Now I?€?m a bit scared that all my Christmas shopping will get lost ???? after all 4???????????????? for the issue that happen today ????,4,24/10/2023
Pleasantly surprised cheap and cheerful items but definitely lots of useful stuff that's cheaper than amazon. I received wrong size of one item on my first order but they credited me for it. Always received fairly promptly too considering coming from China. Have now ordered several times.,4,24/10/2023
Do you realise people like me are getting scammed on your web site with these boxes which you are told that all you pay is the shipping cost and before you know it they are taking more money out of your bank and you never get the box.  Thinking about banning your web site.  Not impressed and the fraud squad has been notified.,1,24/10/2023
"Have placed a few orders with Temu now. Was a bit skeptical at first but the prices were low enough for me to give it a whirl. First order arrived well before expected delivery date which gave me confidence to order again and again (think I've placed about 7 orders so far). I'd seen a few vids to know that the packaging might cause some boxes to crush and this has happened but the goods inside were undamaged. It does pay to read the reviews of the products to see what others thought of the quality or if they advise to size up or down. I haven't been disappointed yet. I had one parcel that EVRI said they couldn't deliver but when I got back in touch with Temu I got a satisfactory resolution within approx 20mins, would probably have been quicker if I'd had a better signal. Excellent polite customer service. Just received another order on Sunday, again it was early and excellent quality. Temu gets a BIG thumbs up from me.",5,24/10/2023

I waited 3 weeks for delivery of order (PO-186-04767804785272284). I was not at home when Coreos attempted delivery and Temu then requested the delivery was returned to them after i had been to Coreos office. Maybe they are worried I will make a claim for late delivery (which i wouldn't have) i spoke to the online customer services and they would not give me an explanation of why the delivery was returned. In fact they cut me off mid conversation. It was a package of 8 items which I had spent some time ordering online. Now they have deserted me with no consideration for me as a customer.,1,24/10/2023

It was delivered by evri and royal mail and all parcels arrived, taht were due to come. I am happy with the products, and the jumper I bought was thick and the trainers good quality. The electrical items like touch screen watch worked well. And it was easy to set the time in them with out instructions. Took 2 minutes. Including u wrapping it. Thought I would review because I honestly didn't know what to expect. But i can give a solid thumbs up. Some good things for great prices.",5,24/10/2023
TEMU delivered on time and the product was just as I ordered and of good quality.,5,24/10/2023
Sceptical at first. Items for pence seems like a red flag. But I?€?ve ordered 4 different times now and everything?€?s been there. Apart from delivery that was delivered but not actually delivered. Thanks Evri! Not! But yeah super affordable things. Only problem you can literally spend 1/2 on here adding things you really don?€?t need to your cart then you end up spending 40-50-60 quid lol.,5,24/10/2023
"So, I got some lamps randomly from here. They were LED lamps that apparently you charge via USB. I did not look at the fine print, but the reviews looked good. Unfortunately, you'll have to charge constantly or they will instantly dim down until you can't really see the light anymore. I find that this defeats the purpose using a charger like this. Having them cordless but only for one hour at a time doesn't make sense. It's just pretty useless, unless you find having a usb charger going into the lamp at all times as fine. You'll need good outlets to put them in the right vicinity as well. I get the idea of Temu though, only show the good reviews first and the bury the bad ones. The material of their products is pretty bad so I doubt there aren't more bad reviews for a lamp that barely charges within 4 hours. They employ a lot of psychological tricks to get you to buy using timers and bombarding you with good reviews. It's a neat trick, however, it won't be to your benefit when you get a bad product you can't use. I would go and get something basic from IKEA instead.",1,24/10/2023
"Very poor company, couldn't get size if lamps we ordered even though it was stated in the box when they arrived,photo of product extremely misleading.

The lamp we got,and we ordered 5, for our business, was a meagre 27cm wide  . Stop using clever photography  you now have my order number as requested  sort it out!!!!

"This is the worst shopping app I have dealt with. I placed two experimental orders and had to return some items. I contacted them several times for refund and they just gave me some lousy answers. I gave up and told them to give away the amount for charity. Not to mention the quality if the product is just garbage and the credibility is null.

My daughter purchased a princess dress for her daughter and it was so nice that she ordered 2 more. I have purchased many bits including under cupboard lighting (fantastic), electric toothbrush holders, kitchen accessories, leather to patch a car seat and car phone/I pad car holders that all seem great so far. Obviously if there is something you want they tend to have it so just use your own judgement and read the reviews.",4,25/10/2023

The only thing are the games where you can earn free gifts, they make it BC almost impossible to win anything unless you have 500 friend who are happy to be referred, fish land goes from being able to fed a fish with 60-70g of fish food to needing over 300g which can take over 2 days to gather and the spin the wheel game is as bad I don?€?t believe that many people dnd up with free gifts, there should be more discounts for regular buyers other than having to play silly games in hope that you might get a gift",4,25/10/2023

"First order with TEMU. Instead of delivering my order to a safe place ie walking through my front gate and leaving out of the elements on my porch, PFL Logistics threw my order (containing glass bottles) over my fence and left it in the rain and dirt in my garden. I had to go climbing through shrubs to even find it, where one would least expect it. When I went to review my order with TEMU, they don't allow you to review on customer service or delivery - just the items purchased. Additionally, I went to contact them to raise this issue and they offer no email contact. The only contact is to chat to a bot. So I outlined the issue and a bot replied and asked me to outline my issue. I told them I had and to read it. It was then escalated to someone else and they to repeated the same line. They deliberately obstruct you and prevent communication and complaints. I have two more orders on there was and they will be the last. I fully intend on writing reviews across social media to warn people what this company is like. Interesting to note they've switched off Facebook reviews... clearly hiding the numerous complaints and poor feedback. Update: Temu is attempting to have my review deleted, by way of asking for more information about my order - they didn't want it when I attempted to resolve this with them direct. Provided as requested. I don't recommend anyone waste time or money buying from TEMU. The only thing they do efficiently is take your money.",1,25/10/2023
Said receive 4 free gifts. Have to keep inviting people to get enough points only needed half point. Went off before I could get it.  It is a scam to get people to sign up. I have spent a fortune on this site more fool me.,2,25/10/2023
They're faster than any other company operating from China and prices can't be beat. Many of the same items on Amazon for 3 times the price.,5,25/10/2023

Very good site.A lot of informacion about the products,5,25/10/2023
"I?€?ve had some good experiences shopping with Temu, however, this last experience is very disappointing and distressing.I made 2 big enough purchases when the item arrived not all was up to standard and requested a refund for the items I no longer wanted. I was sent the 2 PO numbers to use for the return and I opted for a post office.I use 2 packages for the return via the post office. Not after I got a refund for 1 of the boxes and the denied refund for the other, I then queried why that was and I was told by the customer service team that there were zero items returned in the other package with 1 identified item. I?€?ve been back and forth with customer service trying to understand what happened to return/ missing items, and all they kept saying is The WAREHOUSE says 0 returns and 1 unidentified item.Now this is where it becomes very for me distressing i?€?m not a thief nor am I a liar! Why would I send have stuff back and then while still asking for a my refund..I asked them to investigate what could happen between the post office and their warehouse and All they kept saying is the warehouse says the warehouse says. I was told they're not giving me a refund/store credit nor are they resending the items back.So now I am out of pocket and I don?€?t have items.What is the most disturbing is that they can refuse anyone?€?s return claim in the warehouse said!!",1,25/10/2023
"I shop at Temu and it works fine, products are generally a bit small and a bit thin/ cheaply made but I get what I expect most times. Delivery has been great. Their pricing changes daily but you get credit if the price drops in 30 days.  However the 2 star review is in respect of the Fishland Game to get free gifts. A total con, goalposts move all the time and it really it is a complete own goal for Temu, why risk upsetting your customer base by insulting us with this rubbish. Do you really think this will generate more business. It must be one of the worst ideas ever. Bad publicity Instead of letting people get the gifts they have spent weeks trying to achieve. Gifts that cost Temu about 99p to make.",2,25/10/2023
"I seriously don?€?t understand the negative reviews. Every single thing I have ordered from Temu has been exactly as described. The quality has always been better than expected. I?€?ve ordered clothes, jewellery, makeup, you name it, and it?€?s always been fantastic. I can only speak as I find. The delivery service is also good. I?€?ve never had to send anything back. I?€?ve been totally satisfied with what I bought. I highly recommend them.",5,25/10/2023

"Have used a few times now and have always been pleased with what I?€?ve got, cheap and cheerful, recently won on the fish game takes practice but can be done but the thing that made me write this review is Evri delivered my package to wrong house, I went on the customer support on Temu and they are resending order out again, no you will have to wait, need proof etc etc. made something very stressful (due to house denying they have received it) a lot easier to deal with. Thank you",5,25/10/2023
They sell rubbish and it?€?s very difficult to return articles for a refund please be very careful what you purchase from this  company.Invoice number : ID rrN17020u0b0vFzmwkv4XmU2d7They called it an U.K. plug which it was not!It was a strange two point plug which I was I unable to find an adapter And the instructions to return for a refund was so complicated I was unable to understand a waste of money altogetherIt was a curling  tongs with brush,1,25/10/2023

I am in the UK & do not speak a work of Spanish! I have given you my email address so please remove it from your system as I do not require your service, have never used your service & am fed up of you spamming my inbox with constant emails! 11 emails today alone!!!",1,25/10/2023

"I placed an order costing ??35 last month . The tracking stopped updating a week ago .Spoke to EVRI ( Temu courier ) whom confirmed the parcel is lost in their network and I was told to claim a refund from Temu. I've send over 20 messages to Temu , I've sent them confirmation from EVRI saying the parcel is lost and yet they are ignoring me. Even Temu own tracking shows the parcel has not moved in 8 days. To be fair: If the order goes wrong with Temu , then it is impossible to resolve. They have a lot of bot levels and a lot of prepared scripts. This can drive you absolutely crazy. I've wasted 2 weeks talking to Temu bots, then being transfer to another bot. Now I need to claim my money back via my credit card . In fact I have to report fraud to my card as Temu haven't delivered my items and haven't refunded me. What other option do I have ... Far more hassle and stress than it is worth . . Once Temu have your money ,it is impossible to get it back. Temu are excellent at blaming a 3rd party and appalling at resolving their own logistical problems. The bots and prescripts will drive you crazy. No worth it.And as your can see from their response below , makes absolutely no sense to my review. That's a prime example of their communication",1,26/10/2023
I sent back 3 items that I ordered as the quality and fit wasn't great. I have just received an email today to say returns have been received and will be reviewed.

Temu themselves maybe cheap but it comes at a price of a lot of dodgy emails which are constant.

I have ordered lots and I?€?m 99% of the time very happy. Descriptions and measurements are clear and need to be read. Returns VERY easy. Highly recommend.,5,27/10/2023
"Well I really can't say anything negative. Yes, I've had some items that didn't live up to expectations but temu are great at giving fuss free refunds and free returns so there's no issue. I've purchased a lot of things from clothes to DIY products, and honestly, it's been great. I've had expensive items and they definitely are made well and cheaper items especially clothing is quite surprisingly good quality. I had one late delivery and was credited for it. My advice to customers is read product descriptions properly, check product reviews and photos. Dont expect fast postage as these products have a long way to travel. I've never waited longer than 12 days, and usually, delivery time has been 9 days. You can't go wrong. Temu do care about their customers, always remember it's pretty much a massive sellers platform and temu relies on the customers to help weed out the sellers that sell low quality or faulty products which I think they do well, I've seen a lot of products removed/no longer available after having low scoring reviews so, they are doing good considering the amount of sellers on the platform.",5,27/10/2023
Thought I would try and ordered a 7 items:Mobile phone mains charger - First use got very hot and smelt and I disconnected it.  The CE mark was on a piece of transparent tape that could be easily removed.  I threw it away.USB Cable with three different ends - first time I plugged it into my car and put a phone on it blew the fuse in my car.  Binned it.Mobile Phone Windscreen Holder - first time I used the sucker cup it broke.Mobile phone hold - solid piece of rubber - looks fine and what I expected.Two different sets of microfiber clothes - total rip of with very low thread density - will use as general rags - certainly not what I had hoped to used them for.Box of nuts and bolts - looks OK but I havent used any yet!  2 out of 7 is disgusting - one dangerous product and one that blew my car fuses....Seriously poor - how do they expect to hold customers for more than one transaction shipping this rubbish.,1,27/10/2023
"Was sceptical about temu due to reviews and prices seeming too good to be true.  I didn't need to panic.  I placed an order and all was great, so I keep ordering.  I can't stay off the app.  I am addicted!  It really is fantastic in my opinion.  Would highly recommend as no issues so far.",5,27/10/2023
Yet to recieve the item but just 2 days after purchasing from Temu I have received emails that closely resemble Temu which if clicked on will take you to a website that contains viruses. The next email even says I missed the mystery prize and click here to have it redelivered. either they have been hacked and just don't care or they are in league with the hackers. They must surely know about this.If you value your data and your sanity don't buy from Temu. Once I receive my goods I will be deleting my account.Update - 1 day later. So Trustpilot said I had to provide proof of the above so that Temu could reply. I sent proof and Temu reply with only a generic answer with NO mention of why am now being bombarded (yes another 3 emails today) with links to virus laden websites. Shameful Trustpilot and TemuFurthur update - If you look at the reply from Temu they haven't even bothered to address the issue. I am still getting fake emails purporting to be from Temu (if you hover mouse over links they lead to a virus laden website) - Typifies what they think of customers and our security.,1,27/10/2023
Made an order but temu did never connect with PayPal so the order never god paid.Tried 8-9-10 times with no luck....,1,27/10/2023
"If I could leave a review without any stars I would, because Temu doesn?€?t deserve even one star!!I placed three orders all in the span of a week. They delivered nothing! Temu went thru the exercise of pretending to send and deliver each order. But nothing was ever delivered, not one item! Temu is a SCAM. PERIOD! If you are watching or listening to influencers about temu, then DON?€?T, these ?€?influencers?€? are being promised free items from Temu if they refer people who place orders. These are actually the only people who receive products of any kind!The poor suckers they refer to Temu are out whatever money they spend!  The internet is full of complaints about packages that never arrive, and refusals for refunds when they fail to deliver!The BBB gives them a very low rating because of the customer complaints that they never received their packages! Temu scammers have been getting away with this rip off since the company started only in September!STAY AWAY FROM TEMU IF YOU CANNOT RISK LOSING ANY MONEY, THESE PEOPLE ARE CHINESE SCAMMERS! TEMU IS NOT AN HONEST COMPANY, THEY WANT YOU TO PLACE ORDERS, THEN THEY KEEP YOUR MONEY AND YOU GET NOTHING!!!I stand by this review, temu?€?s response does nothing to he get my money back! Here?€?s and excerpt from the last email I got from these fraudsters!?€?We are so sorry for the inconvenience it may have caused. Please allow me to explain that we have investigated this issue with the concerned team, and they confirmed that we delivered the correct items to the correct address. You can refer to the tracking details which say delivered by J&T express. Thanks for your patience?€?These criminals are refusing to give me back my money and insist the package was delivered to the correct address! The carrier doesn?€?t speak English, and I don?€?t speak Spanish! It?€?s not my responsibility to go chasing down packages they claim they delivered, not one of the three orders made it to my door! NOT ONE!! How?€?s that not fraud!!!",1,27/10/2023

Arrived before end date given and my first order from Temu was excellent quality. I ordered large bed settee cover and rise and recline chair cover and all were easy to fit and look superb. I have another 2 orders coming so I now feel confident that their products are of good quality. Thank you to all at Temu.,5,27/10/2023

"First time ordering from Temu and it hasn?€?t been a great experience. Items haven?€?t moved in transit for days and days. It?€?s been over two weeks since I ordered. With a delivery window between 2-10 Nov which has passed. Contacted customer service and replies are automated and vague. At this point, unless something drastic happens to restore my confidence I will not order again.Edit: they say they will give a refund if the item doesn?€?t move for 15 days. It got to the stage of not moving for several days then they changed tracking to: ?€?Arrived at airport?€? on the 11th November. My last update before that was ?€?Arrived at airport?€? on 4th November. How could it have arrived at airport twice?! If I check the external Evri link. It says ?€?We?€?ve got it?€? since 28th October. With no updates since. So are you updating your own bogus tracking just so you don?€?t have to refund me via your policy? Something is fishy. Thank god I paid via PayPal. I suggest if you are reading this to do the same and cover your back.",1,27/10/2023

How the delivery could fail before it had even despatched is a mystery.Trying to sort the problem out, or even get them to explain it clearly in the first place, was almost impossible. I gave up and just cancelled the order.The experience was dreadful and I will never try getting anything from them again.I'm convinced that the offer of a free drone is some sort of scam to draw you in and start buying stuff with no intention of ever send out a drone.",1,28/10/2023

"I like Temu. I still continue to shop on there if I can find a good deal, but there are some things I?€?m noticing as I continue buying on the website. What draws people in are the cheaper prices and the good discounts/coupons/# of free items you also can obtain. At first I was getting a lot of items on this website for 1/3- 1/2 of the price that you can find here in the U.S. ?€?which made it worth it for the longer wait time. However, I am noticing as you continue to keep purchasing on their website, prices for products become closer and closer to that sold on Amazon or even the same if not MORE expensive for items sold there. Also the discounts/coupon amounts become less and less and will usually end up with a maximum of a $10 coupon and ONLY eligible if you buy a certain $ amount which causes you to buy more than what you originally planned so they make up that $ by making you buy more. That is quite disappointing. I mean I understand they are trying to maximize their revenue also, but the whole point of shopping on the website is because it is a much more affordable price compared to the overpriced items here(or anywhere else). Since it?€?s a minimum of a 2 week wait for items, I felt the original prices were worth the wait. Now as I?€?m noticing prices have increased I find myself buying the items from Amazon again because it?€?s here much faster and for about the same price.  I will say 95% of my items from Temu were always good quality. There were only a couple of times I was not entirely impressed but to be fair this can also happen with any website purchase honestly. I always compare prices with  other websites before I purchase on Temu and I am still finding decent prices (for now). If the items are comparable to prices on Amazon I just shop on there. I fear as Temu continues to grow and gain more popularity prices will not be much different than here as it?€?s already happening.",4,28/10/2023

How surprised was I then, when my items were delivered within a week and are absolutely great! I ordered a velvet bedspread which was just over a tenner with free delivery as a new customer incentive and what I received was a luxurious, vibrantly coloured and well made bedspread which looks and feels far superior to one I bought for 10x the price. Since then, I?€?ve placed subsequent orders, all of which have got to me within a week via evri delivery and I?€?ve yet to be disappointed with the quality and price of temu.",5,28/10/2023

I would give the 5 stars but I am on my mobile and it seems to only offer 4 stars. I have shopped from temu for around 9 months and everything has been spot on. When I had any issues like they sent me boots that the leg in the boot wasn't wide enough so I couldn't wear  them They offered me a refund  but something went wrong with the process they told me to keep boots or give them to charity which I did. Remember it is very cheap to purchase their items but I can honestly say that everything I've purchased has been surprisingly well made and very nice styles. When I wear my. Dresses or anything from temu I always get a compliment! I think for the financial climate  it is well worth it. I always get my parcel on time. I have never been disappointed with anything so far and even if I was I wouldn't complain for the cheap price and you can always send it back. As I said I would give  them 5 stars but it doesn't show the whole 5 stars on my phone and don't have a laptop.,5,28/10/2023
"Brilliant service! Have been using Temu mostly for craft supplies since it?€?s UK launch and have always found them to be highly efficient and trustworthy. Sure it?€?s a little bit of a gamble quality wise with some things but a little common sense goes a long way with Temu and 90% of the time it?€?s absolutely fine. If their prices could be matched in the UK, I would purchase in the UK, but as long as our government is bending us all over I will continue to shop where I can afford to. Temu has not let me down with any of the numerous orders I have placed. Definitely worthy of considering before paying stupid money for exactly the same items here in the UK?€? Recently have noticed their prices creeping up to comparable with here and in some cases more than here which no doubt will lose them business. Just do a bit of checking before ordering.",5,28/10/2023
"I've changed this review multiple times and finally given Temu enormous credit for sorting my package out. I think all along this was a problem, similar with previous packages, with Hermes. I think Temu contacted the carrier and my package hopefully arrives today. Overall it's more complicated receiving packages because of where they're coming from but I'd say the products I've bought have been generally pretty good for what you pay.",5,28/10/2023

"TEMU 5??? shopping. Free delivery, flash sales, share with friends for points and free gifts in games.Products are as expected IF you bother to read the descriptions properly. Ive spent ??300+ since they opened on some amazing items. Not clothes so much but everything else!Delivery is faster than Shein and products tend to be cheaper than them too. Postage takes about 7-10 days, sometimes a bit quicker.10/10 from me Temu",5,29/10/2023
"Iv been fairly happy with my purchases from temu, most things are just like the description and pictures. The only issue iv found a few times is when iv ordered some metal signs, 4 times now they have been sent with zero protection so have arrived very dented. Although I have always been refunded for them it still doesn?€?t help the item I wanted can?€?t be used/gifted were as places like Ali express always packaged their stuff better.",4,29/10/2023
"This Chinese company just sells garbage, they steal other artists designs with no regard for copyright, they spam you with porn like images.  I literally can't believe they are allowed to do business in the US.  For reference - I am an artist who sells my designs in my Etsy shop and they have stolen over 2 dozen of my copyright protected pieces and replicate them for sale.  Clearly they could careless about following any ethical standards here in the US.  If you support this company in any way shame on you.",1,29/10/2023
I keep receiving notices that my order has been delivered yet I received no order. This is very frustrating.I have ordered any times from Temu yet have only received two orders. I have also recommended this company to several of my friends. If this problem is not resolved I will not order again.,1,29/10/2023
"pros: cheap.Cons: overpriced.parcel left on doorstep by Evri, wasnt there when i got home an hour later. or maybe the courier just took a pic of it and took it home.  who knows?IMPOSSIBLE to contact them, or their courier (Evri), to sort it out.would not use again. AVOID!Edit: after posting feedback for Evri, and giving trustpilot my order details requested by temu, thecwheels have turned a bit. Evri have been in touch, apologetic, and stressed the need (to get axtefund or reorder) to go to temu via the temu online chat facility (which was frankly not working for me yesterday, no response to my last message).  I am persisting with this temu chat route and will update this review when delivery or refund is fully resolved.",1,29/10/2023
Love love love Temu!!! Great prices and great customer service. The shipping is usually a week or less and the quality of the products is always good. I have been so grateful that I have been able to decorate my house with new stuff because it is affordable. I've also decorated the lobby at my job and making my boss happy because of the transformation at such a low price,5,29/10/2023
"First they sent me ??100 off vouchers which I was never allowed to use, then my parcels were not delivered and I?€?ve been going around in circles with their Customer Service, who is only mocking me for a week now (saying things like I will get ??5 reward for having to wait long, that they will get back to me next day but they don?€?t, etc.). My order was very important to me and this experience has absolutely destroyed the will of ever shopping on their web&app again.",1,29/10/2023

"I was very nervous after placing my first order,as I had heard mixed reviews about Temu,but I must say I was pleasantly surprised!The pajamas I bought were good quality,fit perfectly,and looked just like the display pictures.I had my order within a week,and I was easily able to track my order every step of the way..I have since placed two more orders,and again my purchases arrived quickly,and were as described.I also love that they offer free shipping on everything,no matter how much you spend.I will definitely be ordering regularly from Temu,as they are more affordable than other popular shopping sites.",5,30/10/2023

Great site.The only annoying thing is Farmland and the other games. They are so hard to get free items from and a bit misleading. Customer service is fantastic and I love the price adjustment service they offer.",5,30/10/2023
Generally very good but their item contents can at times be very confusing as to what you are likely to get.One item of double sided tape was downright misleading with advert showing reel of tape being the same size as the palm of your hand but when it arrived was only 30 mm in diameter. In all fairness they did refund the cost. Just be extra careful when ordering,4,30/10/2023
Well not doing well. First order Evri delivered to an address not mine and I haven't a clue! Second order delivered to the wrong house number though the correct number was on the account. So disappointed and they won't refund me. Won't be ordering from them again. It's not my fault the delivery company they use is hopeless!!THEY ARE STILL DELIVERING TO NUMBER 36 WHICH IS THE WRONG ADDRESS EVEN MY ACCOUNT HAS THE RIGHT ADDRESS NUMBER 37 AND THEY WON'T REFUND ME I'M DISABLED I CAN'T GO HUNTING FOR MY PARCELS AND I'VE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY NEARLY ??100 AND THEY WON'T REFUND ME DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE THIEVES!!!  THEY REFUSE TO REFUND MY MONEY THEY DELIVERED IT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS MY ADDRESS IS CORRECT ON MY ACCOUNT WITH THEM THIEVES THIEVES THIEVES THIEVES GIVE ME BACK MY ??100Still no parcels received. No customer service they won?€?t talk to me. All they had to do was send it to the address on my account not another number.

"To date, I think I have made at least more than 300 purchases through Temu with my daughter and friends. Sometimes an item was damaged or not as described, but then I got my money back from this company without any problem. Temu is very thorough with fantastic after-sales service. You will be helped in no time.Do not hesitate to make purchases, this company is very good and deserves a big 10 out of 10.",5,30/10/2023

Bought a really cute outfit for my dog which was well-made and very reasonable but then again I bought some shirts that weren?€?t very expensive at all and I just didn?€?t like them. I don?€?t understand how people are complaining when just return what you don?€?t like it?€?s free.",4,30/10/2023
I have had numerous things from Temu and my experience has been good. The delivery has been quick and they ask for an honest review of the items I've bought which I do. I can honestly say I've had one item that I haven't been pleased with and when I went to write my review I was asked why it was low starred and they gave me a refund immediately.  I would definitely recommend to my family and friends.,5,30/10/2023
"Made a large order with Temu and ended up returning most of the items due to poor quality/bad sizing etc. Sent all the items together in the same lot and out of the 42 items mysteriously 24 didn?€?t reach Temu (even though they were all sent together), they say they have received ?€?extra items?€? which I have no idea what they are and so I am down nearly ??200 refund. Waiting for customer service to get back to me to get my money back but having very little hope. I will update this review if I ever get my refund.Update: Customer service has been really good and quick responding and efforts have been made to make a full refund. I?€?m still trying to sort out the exact amount due to discrepancies in the price advertised and the price actually charged but so far have received almost the total amount.",3,30/10/2023

"I've placed exactly three orders with Temu.com, all of which I placed on my computer, by typing the site name into the web address bar, and activating Rakuten cash back before adding items and purchasing. All three orders, I had to reach out multiple times to get my cash back. I reached out to Temu directly and they told me to reach out to Rakuten, which I have also done. I finally received cash back for 2 of the 3 orders, but I am still fighting for the cash back for my order placed on 10/14/2023, WEEKS ago. Several times, Rakuten has updated to state Temu has not provided cash back for the order. I've already notified Temu I will not shop with them anymore for this reason. Do not state you will provide cash back if you don't plan to honor that - keeping your word is a huge thing with me and I will not purchase repeatedly from a company that will not keep its word. I've unsubscribed from emails and texts and put in ANOTHER request with Rakuten to find out why I'm not getting cash back, but this site is a joke for that reason, which is sad because most of the items were actually ok, except the shoes were small in size and I'm not sure I will be able to wear them.",1,30/10/2023

"You know something is up when the reviews are either very bad or very good. I bet a lot of the five star reviews are fake. I?€?ve bought a few things on Temu and found one good item, hence the two-star review and not a one-star one. I do have to say that most of what they sell is super super cheap and you can tell. The pictures are WAY better than the product you receive. Ultimately you get what you pay for: cheap crap. Clothing item sizes are not adapted to western sizes so don?€?t even bother. I just binned what arrived I was so disappointed.",2,31/10/2023
"First, it is not an American company, so item took 2 or more weeks to arrive. Second, the item is a knock off.  I thought that I was buying something else.  Very disappointed.  I was duped!!!!",1,31/10/2023
"I ordered a squirrel baffle and after several days received only part of the necessary items advertised. So I asked for a replacement to be sent, again after several days the replacement arrive - again minus half the parts. Them had a completely worthless on-line chat with someone that frankly was a waste of time and just offering the same options that had already failed to be sent twice. I suggest avoid this company at best they are useless at worst they are a scam!Regarding Temu's posted reply this is exactly the same email I have received numerous times but with no action on their part to provide the missing parts of the product, so same old, same old, probably automated response.",1,31/10/2023
"Temu is quite good actually, I have been pleased with everything so far. I have ordered from them a few times now with no problems whatsoever. Their prices are great and there are many items sold on their website, which are far cheaper, than identical items that are being sold here in the UK. When you order, your deliveries can be tracked and they always arrive safe and on time. I love the Fishland and Farmland games. I have recently won on the Fishland one and have my free gift on the way. Another item was not available, so Temu credited my account for me. All I can say is keep up the good work Temu, you're brilliant!! ????????????????????",5,31/10/2023
Great products at fantastic prices. I ordered 3 items they all came together.Miles cheaper than the high st. but maybe that's a problem for some people.,5,31/10/2023
"As long as you pay extremely careful attention to what you are purchasing then for the most part I have had no issues out of 11 orders with Temu. Anything that is poor quality has been easily refunded and a lot of the time not even needed returning. Temu customer service is very good and easy to deal with should I need to go a bit further than the standard online processes. Most stuff we purchase comes from China so being able to buy direct without getting ripped off by UK resellers is a major plus. To summarise, if I pay great attention to the details of the items and really be sure on what I am purchasing then taking the price into consideration I normally end up with what I expected and if not then the returns/refund process is simple and works.",5,31/10/2023
"Terrible service, keep opening tickets and they get closed. I have not received my order and no one is helping me? I will never order from these again.Reply to Temus reply. Evri will not speak to me as the SELLER needs to contact them. I have opened many tickets and tried speaking to the live app and all Temu is doing is closing my tickets.",1,31/10/2023

So I advise people to avoid the free gifts promotions and save irritating contacts etc.",2,31/10/2023
"What a horrendous company, the fact all the 5 star reviews are most certainly fake.I'm unfortunately one of them silly people who fell for the company should of read the negative reviews before buying. Items are cheap, badly made and smaller than what you order not true to size. The app doesn't keep you updated with where your delivery is as was two days behind updating where my delivery was. Overly expensive for what you get. Never again my xl dog bed  bought for my Belgian malinois just fits my 5 month lab pup on.

Generally items are cheap and cheerful quality. Not much wrong with item until you come to packaging. Due to habit of packing all items in a plastic bag what one receives varies in how pristine it is. For soft or solid items packing this way is OK but for non fixed shaped goods it isn't good enough.. So bags and candles fine table Christmas trees totally squashed not sure they will recover. I'll use them again but be very carefully over what I order. Delivery time is good.,3,01/11/2023

T-shirts were very strangely sized. A M came up basically the same as an XL. Other items just seemed quite cheap /poor quality. Also now I have heard that a Congressional report published in the US in June this year warned that 'there is an extremely high risk that Temu?€?s supply chains are contaminated with forced labor' I would not shop with them again because of concerns about where and how the products are made.,1,02/11/2023

"If you want cheap clothes to knock around in that you don't mind chucking away after a couple of wears then happy days! Poor quality, sizing wrong. Lots of bobbling to material after 1 wash, stitching and seams don't last long. One pair of trousers literally fell apart at the seams on the 1st wash. The discounted offers sent through seem amazing but the bargain price you pay is probably still a bit on the high side, based on the quality of the garments! Not convinced that the reviews are genuine as they are all 4/5*. I have left honest reviews (1-4*) on all purchases and can't see any of them listed against the product. Probably better off going to the cheap stall at your local market or to the pound shop, at least you get to see what sizing/quality is actually like before buying. Kids wooden toys/puzzles have been smaller than expected and therefore questionable as to whether they're actually suitable for the targeted age range. Ordered some ""ceramic"" plant pots which were plastic when they arrived. Like I said you get what you pay for so don't have high expectations if you decide to order.

I love this app.I have bought so much stuff from them and everything I ordered I received and the quality is awesome! Their return policy is excellent I have never had one issue with this site It is truly the best shopping site ever It does take like 2 weeks to get your order and they have free shipping.,5,02/11/2023

"Prices are higher than on competitors, so you have discount codes and offers. They are a lie. The gamification on the app to make you buy more like Fishland is a scam. When you are close to completing a game, they reduce the points you earn and increase the time needed to achieve the objectives. Don't play them. It is better to clean a house as a cleaner, take the money and buy products on Aliexpress or Shein than play games for months and not win anything, or, if you win, have something cheap like a tablecloth, trousers or something like that.",1,02/11/2023
"Such a poor experience. Awful imitation lego that wasn?€?t worth it even for ??2. Terrible offers that never paid out, and horrendous marketing. Refunds are by credits, encouraging you to buy again.

"It's getting really unpleasant. I'm slowing down my purchases on Temu because of the packaging: not a single order is received without damaged boxes on delivery. When it's for me, it's annoying, but it's still okay; but when it's for a gift, it's null and void, it gives the impression of offering a second-hand product. Temu, if you find a solution so that the product boxes are perfect on arrival, you'll increase your sales. In any case, I'm going to increase my orders.",2,03/11/2023
I love this site. I am very careful not to order to much at one time. I place my order and wait for it to arrive before ordering anything else. I have found customer services to be really good. I think what I would like to see a change - don't use Evri.,4,03/11/2023
I only wish I could give more than 5 stars. Evri messed up my delivery - what a surprise - by ignoring change of delivery address. I contacted Temu via the help page and David was extremely helpful and delivered a customer service that exceeded my expectations.,5,03/11/2023

Temu dont do refunds they do store credit so you can have another lucky dip. Evri delivery service poor, i shouldve made him walk up the stairs instead of my disabled self going to him and finding he just dump the package at the door.

I bought a gift card to use on the site. Used it once and tried to use it again and it gets rejected. Used PayPal and they accepted it for a few transactions and suddenly decided I was using suspicious activity and won?€?t accept it anymore. I tried contacting them and they just say to use a different card. Amazing that my PayPal works every where else and do does the gift card. They have lost my business.They have decided to accept my gift card payment. I received a message that my order is being shipped. We will wait and see if we receive anything.,3,03/11/2023
Recently purchased 3 items. First item was a shower bidet system advertised as a full set.  Turned out to be just the tap part. No other fittings provided as per the images and description.  Secondly bought a hand held car vacuum that is so useless and small it can?€?t suck up anything of value. The third item was a laptop stand which was cheap and my laptop slips off continuously.

"Been using Temu for a good while now ever since the tax on buying from Ali made purchase cost so high it was not worth it or cost effective. Most of the tat I've bought from Temu has been as good as expected without paying a fortune. What gets me very annoyed is that EVERY SINGLE ITEM SOLD ON THIS WEBSITE HAS 5STAR REVIEWS - wow!. How is that possible, are less than 5 star reviews removed? Are they bot generated? Certainly makes savvy buyers cautious. A typical review 'super, fab, good price...' - no actual details about how good or indeed bad, heaven forbid, an item is.  That said, if I've had the misfortune of buying something nothing like advertised, or broken, etc I've had no trouble with getting a refund. The packaging - dear me - Temu has got to have shares in Sellotape (other brands are available) considering the vast amount used in packaging. Item put into a plastic bag relative to its size then bound, and bound, and bound, and bound with metres of 'sticky back tape' to within an inch of its life rendering said item squashed, misshapen, damaged or broken - sometimes all four. Prices are good, free delivery good - need to sort out the 100% useless 'rave reviews' and the extremely non-eco packaging and they could genuinely achieve 4/5 stars themselves.",2,03/11/2023
"I ordered a few items which arrived today, the 2 jumpers I ordered look nothing like the pictures advertised and the quality was so so poor, sizes were not true to size and I?€?ve popped them straight on Vinted and lost money as they wouldn?€?t fit even if I wanted to wear them!! They were awful.",1,03/11/2023

I placed order half the items missing contacted customer support explained the situation I would of been happy to wait for rest of the order except I was asked same question over and over so I asked for refund the was handed over to a human I think had to explain again and again they kept sending message saying  sorry I was unhappy and if there was any other help I needed to get in touch..........Blatantly trying to baffle with B.S ???? so customers give up and I have hence why I'm leaving this review so others don't get ripped off... if you buy buy small amounts often that way if the worst happens you won't loose a large amount of cash after all the SHIPPING IS FREE ....,1,03/11/2023

"I love Temu and I bought loads of sewing stuff and other for nothing. Fishland is not a scam because I won what I chose, however I made orders to support the winning. I guess must be hard if you don't buy regularly, but definitely the game is not a scam.",5,04/11/2023

"My one and only order. Everything about the process is brilliant until something goes wrong and then the awful customer support steps in and makes it worse. Unsurprisingly the weak link in the chain was Evri but Temu handled it so badly. After zero attempts to deliver Evri have returned the package to Temu who say they cannot reship to my address as this may happen again, however I am welcome to order again but ship to a different delivery address although at a higher cost as the items have increased in price. The only positive I have is the refund was actioned very quickly, however the promised ??5 credit to my account for missing the delivery window has not been made.One last potential problem. It may be weirdly coincidental but since placing my order I?€?ve been receiving spam calls about Chinese visa services",1,04/11/2023
"Shockingly bad customer service after contacting them to say I'd received an email from TEMU saying I'd won a pallet. I was sure it was a scam so thought I'd bring to their attention.

Yes I?€?ve ordered from Temu 3/4 times. After the first experience I realized I must be careful and read the description closely. Not all items are as they appear. Often times items are smaller than pictured. I have had good luck with craft products. My advice?€?read the description when purchasing any product from Temu.I question why they ?€?stress?€? using the app. I don?€?t know if that?€?s a ?€?safe?€? thing to do. I?€?m not that trustful of foreign companies.,3,04/11/2023

Followed the returns instructions but when they were inspected in the warehouse all refused refund.  I posted them within two days after receiving them.  Cheated by this company.

"NO CUTOMER SERVICEThings go wrong whenever you have this large an inventory.  They have no efficient straightforward customer service phone number to handle problems..I wasted onver 30 minutes trying to deal with a typcial bot pretending to be ""human"" customer service.  I ordered a simple $7 item, and was prompted to buy four more and it would be free.I did.  Instead I received two instead of the one I ordered.  And did not receive another item at all.  Plus they charged me for alll five items.  The bot couldn't figure it out.  Mistake#1:  I received two instead of just one, so I return the extra one.  Mistake #2 I did not receive an item I paid for, so they send it to me.  Mistake #3 they subtract the price of that item $7 plus tax, from the total.   Any high school graduate could have followed what I just said.  The bot couldn't.  It wasn't even programmed to hand me over to a person when I so requested.  And they don't have a customer service number.  LESSON LEARNED.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, AND OFTEN DON'T EVEN GET THAT.",1,05/11/2023
"Order was neatly delivered and within a very decent timespan. Products were fine too.Why one star then?Because since about 2 weeks (not long after I ordered from Temu) I'm getting daily calls from commercial phoneline suppliers in the Netherlands. If I block the number, it just another one calling.No legit business in the Netherlands would use a local phonenumber provider, and I haven't ordered anywhere else abroad. I am also registered in ""Bel-me-niet"" register, so companies in NL are not allowed to call my number for commercial purposes.TL/DR: Decent product but your data will be sold. The price one pays for discounted products apparently. Deleted the app and will never order again.",1,05/11/2023
"Most of my orders have been quite okay and good value for money.Recent order was disappointing though. I ordered cushion covers, a blanket and an art print. ... with vab goughs "" Almond Blossom"" print. All we're of good quality and definitely very good value for the price. The disappointment was I'd ordered them all for the same room( bedroom)  but they were all different colours( usually a kind of duck egg blue) The cushion covers were a definite green background. The blanket  a baby blue. The art print turquoise. Individually all lovely but obviously would all clash if displayed in the same room. Used some beautiful transfers for newly decorated  kitchen. Really lovely, easy to apply and unbelievably low priced. All in all some really good merchandise.",4,05/11/2023
Don?€?t be fooled by their coupon deals. You only have a week to use then. Spent money to get coupons and had to spend more to claim them. But they ran out after a week.

"Have used Temu probably few time now, I am relatively new to Temu and just wanted to try it, the first thing attracted me was the low price, even though I have probably spent over ??600 last few month on this site, but I was also returning a lot of the items back due the poor quality of their products, for example Men t- shirts I have tried so many of them but unfortunately most of their t-shirt made from 100% polyester which is not breathable and as soon you wear them it feels like you wearing a bin bag you get hot and sweaty which is not a nice feeling. one of the main disappointment I had from their return process and very poor customer service, I recently realised when I was choosing and item the price was showing for example ??10 and I was ordering few items as I said before and when I was paying at the end of my shopping the price was increasing but I didn?€?t use to pay that attention as they where only few pennies extra, then when I was receiving my orders they where always missing two or three items, again that did bothered me that much, until when I start returning the items I wasn?€?t happy with it I realized the actual price of an item which I thought I paid around ??10 was actually almost double which made me so disappointed to realize that I been scammed by them all along, the issue is every time you try to contact their customer service they can?€?t help you and if you order more than few items you can?€?t really track them to see what you actually you ordered it?€?s poor system and bad customer service I won?€?t recommend anyone to use this site it?€?s not worth the headache,",1,06/11/2023

"Had it not been due to one product I would have given Temu 5 stars. However, after purchasing the Augeas So Easy Straightening Hair Cream and using it as per the directions labeled on the box, and my hair being in perfect condition, I used wanted to straighten it for a change. I do have before photos and after photos of the damage this product did to my hair, which was long and lustrous, and now barely shoulder length and horribly damaged. It came out in clumps. And even after following the directions to the letter, my hair fell out, and felt terribly dry and brittle. I contact Temu customer service, provided all the photos. It?€?s going to cost me over $280 to fix the damage this product has done. Temu then DISCONTINUED the product from the particular seller whom I bought the Augeas So Easy Straightening Hair Cream from, and then have the nerve to offer me $5 for me being patient, not even the actual refund of the product. Discontinuing the product is an instant admission of their guilt and trying to hide what that product did to my hair. I have also directly emailed the company that produces this item, which they sell for $27, Fruugo sells the same product for $67. I?€?m not even sure it?€?s the actual product sold on Temu or if Temu is using a cheap knock off. Either way, I am seeking further legal action and quite happy to post all over social media, including all photos, Temu?€?s responses and that they discontinued the item from that seller. Shame on you Temu.",2,06/11/2023

On first glance it al looks good but really it?€?s just a scam all items can be found at same or cheaper prices online.

The customer service is tricky to find, however, they are very quick to respond, had an issue with an item and the matter was resolved within 30 minutes (a full refund with the balance sitting in the account).I do recommend using this company bit do warn everyone to fully read the product details to ensure that you don't get caught out.",3,06/11/2023

I bought goods over ?? 100. Temu splits the order into two. The logistics company wrongly sent in a delivery report of the goods delivered to the address.Meanwhile, that is false. On Evri (logistic company) show they could not deliver to the address hence the good has been returned to the sender. I am the customer here, and Temu owes me a level of responsibility?€?no attempt to investigate this with Evri. A simple search on the Evri tracking portal will do?€?no passion for the customer. Before now, I have witnessed so many times that Evri would claim that they could not be delivered to my address because I was not at home.Meanwhile, that has been a big lie. I then changed my address to Evri parcel shop ( Post office)for easy delivery. However, the same obstacle continues,  from they could not deliver or could not get the address. For this particular order, I got the tracking update that it has been delivered with a picture as evidence. I went to the parcel shop, only to be told by the post office staff that the driver brought it in snapped and marked it delivered before scanning it for delivery. The barcode on the parcel could not be scanned and they had to return it to the driver. Evri never transmitted or updated their tracking report with Temu whereas they did on their on portal. No way to contact Evri and Temu keeps showing me the same picture of the goods delivered. Just a simple search on the Evri portal will solve this problem. I am the customer here, Temu is contracted to me on this order, not Evri. The combination of Temu and Evri is a disaster.",1,07/11/2023

"I've only known of Temu this year,but I've ordered ALOT! Things that weren't as I'd expected for whatever reason,I've not had problems returning for refund or exchange until lately.I thought there was going to be an issue with a couple orders denied refunding,but Temu customer service was very helpful and resolved the issue in my favor.Mostly the things I've ordered have been just like pictured and good quality.",5,07/11/2023
"Temu being Temu, yet again. I cannot understand why Temu refuses to refund me, as the logistics company has given the go ahead to refund me and Temu still doesn?€?t. They refuse to refund me because they want to force me to stop using their platform, which I obviously will, but still have pending orders and pending refunds. They chose a poor delivery company that consistently delivers parcels to unsafe places and they keep on getting stolen. It?€?s Temu?€?s responsibility to either continue with this company or change, as an item from other more reliable logistics company arrived smoothly with mo issues. I was forced to create an account with the delivery company in question to include a safe place and tell them never to leave the parcels in the place where they do as it?€?s unsafe and items get taken away very frequently. Unfortunately, their drivers ignore all my delivery instructions and the same pattern happens constantly.However, the delivery company?€?s headquarters can?€?t do any more to prove to Temu I am correct, but Temu refuses to even acknowledge the emails the courier sends to me. They stick to the original tracking information, totally ignoring the courier?€? subsequent emails apologising for leaving the parcels in an unsafe place and not following my delivery instructions.Today, I received a telephone call from the courier and they are perplex as to why Temu does not refund me, as they would reimburse me, as the party at fault, but Temu refuses to even acknowledge this simple fact. Following the telephone call with the courier, I has another marathon with Temu?€?s customer service. Not only I had to repeat the same answer over and over again but also ended up waiting a few minutes for the right team, that never showed up, and when I asked if I would speak to the team, I was again told to wait for a few minutes again, only to have the conversation cut immediately, informing me I had been idle for too long and they ended the chat, asking me for feedback. I give up trying to escalate it and am contacting the legal authorities to do something about this loose canon. TEMU IS A ROGUE COMPANY THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE EASY ONLINE TRADE AND JUST REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE CONSUMER ACT.However, as their headquarters is now in Ireland, they are in for a big surprise, with the treatment they provide their clients, being lawless and assuming their Terms are above a sovereign country with institutions to deal with companies like Temu. Absolute abhorrent the way they treat you, and they only have a set of standard sentences to deal with all issues, and if your issue is slightly extraordinary, you can be sure you will have a long battle ahead.",1,07/11/2023
"Honestly superb! Considering their stuff is dispatched from China, it?€?s done fast and effectively. I get my stuff in Scotland within 7 days. From point of order. And everything I?€?ve ever got off Temu and this is my probably 10 order in 6 months. Nothing has broke or not been used. Superb service and quality items. That are much cheaper than eBay and Amazon",5,07/11/2023
"I purchased a high end badminton racket - LiNing AX Force 80, ??60 cheaper than UK retail prices. My order took little over 1 week to arrive. Well within the projected delivery timeframe. The racket came with instructions to check its authenticity, which was very welcoming, as I was worried I had purchased a fake! Very happy with my purchase and experience thus far. I have already recommended this site to my fellow badminton club members.",5,07/11/2023

"I ordered 6 air tag covers on the 16th Oct and not had them delivered yet. Is this a genuine company?They promise a ??5 refund if not delivered soon but will anything I order arrive?If my refund  takes place I will be much happier. I very much doubt I would use this company again, prices are very cheap but in my experience they fail to deliver. Many apologies to Temu my parcel arrived today, I believe Ervi were the problem in slow delivery of the parcel, they are usually very good.My confidence in Temu has been restored I would happily give them 5 stars.Temu?€?s prices are excellent and they did try to deliver my parcel on time but EVRI must be the problem. The parcel took 16 days from ordering to delivery.I now need to cancel my refund.Thank you Temu.",5,07/11/2023
Basically stole my money. They are refusing to give me my ??300 refund. After spending so much on there website. I had to give up fighting for it due to my mental and physical health. So very disappointed. Worst shopping experience ever. No wonder they?€?re so cheap. No ethics whatsoever.,1,08/11/2023
"Brilliant site, well laid out, prices are insane. Make use of the vouchers after your first order of ??20 for further discounts that you can add onto your first order. Items arrive within 5 days or you get a ??5 voucher. I've ordered 100s of items with only 1 return, they heavily discounted it and credited my account immediately and I kept the item. Super happy.",5,08/11/2023
"Been buying of Temu for about 2 months now ,and ive bought a few things with out any problems.I bought 2 watches a mans and a womans,the womans was ok the mans not so good unfortunately it keeps stopping and the hands drop.I could send it back without any problem,but what I paid for it it's hardly worth it.Every other thing I've bought on Temu have been top class.they come on time,no complaints from this end.",5,08/11/2023
Have purchased off Temu lots n lots lol . Some good son ok ! But make sure you look at the sizes correctly as some come up small when you order your normal size !! Other than that great for gadgets etc .,5,08/11/2023
I have ordered from Temu many times. Its become an addiction. Have been ordering for months and for the most everything is excellent quality and well made and super cheap. Just the odd random items sometimes arrive broken and I've had 2 3 parcels arrived torn with items missing (normally when something from inside the parcel has cut through and made a big hole)Other than that I love Temu however the last month or so the delivery has seriously slowed. I used to get my parcels in a week but now it takes a few days for the items to even get shipped. Then another few days before it arrives at the airport. Honestly disappointed and its put me off ordering,4,08/11/2023
Don?€?t order if you want a refund!!!Ordered once from this company back in August and needed a refund on one item. Advised it would be with me in 10-14 days but didn?€?t receive the money. Logged a call and they were very apologetic and polite and said that they would refund the whole of my order to make up for the mess ??53.82.Again still no refund. This has now been going on for 3 months will never use the company again.,1,08/11/2023
"I've ordered four times from TEMU. Every purchase was delivered on time, as according to the website projected date. All the received merchandise  was true to the website description. I've read negative reviews from buyers, who obviously didn't read the product description. They didn't get  what they expected but got got exactly what they ordered. I have bought several high quality items as ridiculously low prices & several decent quality items, at good prices. I love this website & keep ordering, from them.",5,08/11/2023
"So far, I'm quite happy. Typically, it takes about 8 to 10 days for things to arrive. But considering the fact that the prices are about 1/2 of what Amazon charges, I'm usually able to wait. But sometimes not.  I'm somewhat disappointed in the selection. Mostly they have lower cost items. For example, if you try to shop for a Blu-ray player, I find nothing. But great for tools, clothing, and many more simple articles. I have never been cheated. Everything that I have ordered has shown up.  Here's how it appears to work. You are ordering directly from manufacturers or distributors in Asia, (usually China). They ship to a logistics company near you. The logistics company then ships it to you. Sadly, they often use UPS Sure Post, which is slower than regular UPS. But the items DO arrive.",5,08/11/2023
"Have ordered a few things and have no issues, great products great prices and good delivery why pay stupid prices elsewhere for the same product",5,08/11/2023
Temu sells nothing but cheap cheap products carpet squares are terrable the carpet is coming off the pad right out of the package. won't let me return it none of this stuff is of any quality. Now I found out Teemu has a whole lot of complaints through the Better Business Bureau. They do not keep up on quality.,1,08/11/2023
"Happy enough with my products considering the price, I was really pleased with the quality of one of my canvases in particular. Delivery was fine and everything arrived on time. One item did arrive broken, but it was glass and considering how cheap it was, I wasn?€?t overly bothered. Would definitely shop from Temu again.",4,09/11/2023
"I had an amazing experience with Temu! Their service is top-notch, and the product quality exceeded my expectations. The website is easy to navigate, and their shipping was quick and reliable. The customer support was responsive and helpful. I'm impressed with Temu and would definitely recommend them to others!",5,09/11/2023
I have ordered several times. Totally impressed with absolutely everything I have received. Quality of everything is great.,5,09/11/2023
I have bought clothes from Temu and they?€?re absolutely fine! Perfect sizing. Parcel arrived in one piece with no problems.,5,09/11/2023
"Returned a jumper as I had this in another colour which was good quality ,sadly when I bought in a different colour the quality was completely different so returned, this was a month ago and still no refund so at present temu have my jumper and my money, be careful guys!Following response from temuI have proof I returned the items and the quality was shocking as shown on the picture, please just be careful guys!",1,09/11/2023
"I?€?m always excited when my Temu parcel arrives. I?€?ve ordered quite a few times and so far very impressed. Sometimes the images of the item are not quite the same as the item you receive but almost identical so I?€?m still satisfied overall. It?€?s expected that it can?€?t be a top quality item for the prices you pay but as said it?€?s almost similar - I?€?m very happy. They even refunded me on my first return on a couple of items without me having to post it back, they let me keep the items!!! No complaints from me. Keep it up Temu. Oh and their games are fun, I?€?ve almost reached my free gifts, can?€?t wait!!!",5,09/11/2023
Seems like a lot of 5* reviews look very similar. Probably fake. My experience is buying cheap gadgets (<??5) seems OK. You get what you pay for.,3,09/11/2023
"I am surprised by the bad reviews. I have placed 5 orders over 3 weeks and have received them quickly and without issues.free delivery too.The goods are cheap and cheerful, but you get what you pay for, and I've bought kitchen gadgets, a few clothes, pet blankets, costume jewellery and a surprisingly nice handbag for the money. All are perfectly fine and I have no complaints.when I told family that I had bought from Temu, they seemed horrified and said that they steal people's bank details. I think that is rubbish. I use Paypal, and delete the payment method after each purchase anyway.My opinion is that any delivery issues are the fault of Evri (rebranded Hermes!)If you expect John Lewis quality at Poundland prices, dont be surprised when you are disappointed.Yes, the packaging could be better, but it's free.Yes they do send a lot of emails, but in truth so does every company, cheap or high end so get over it and delete them! I dont understand all the games stuff - I dont get involved with that nonsense. I want to buy a few bits, not play stupid games, so dont engage with them. My overview is why would I want to pay ??5 for a little blanket for my cat when I can pay less than ??1. Get over yourselves people - Temu is what it is, a bit of cheap shopping and I am quite happy with that.",5,09/11/2023
Goods did not get delivered. I contacted & they gave me a tracking number & insisted it had been delivered. Aus post says tracking number doesn?€?t exist. I asked for photo proof & signature but they have not replied. Don't waste your  money on these scammers.,1,09/11/2023
I wrote a bad review before a purchase was completed.  I was skeptical. Everything went smoothly. I've done more business with temu.,5,09/11/2023
"A really good honest company, Fully refunded if items never arrived, ??5.00 into account if items arrived past a certain date delivery time, faulty items just send in picture proof and refund back into credit account within 15 minutes. Only problem is one can get addicted to browsing and buying cos the items are so cheap yet good  enough quality and the choice is just unbelievable in each section. Wish there was this around when my kids were little.",5,09/11/2023
"Most products are great and cheap . when I have had a problem in the last year,Temu gave me credit immediately, Or refunded it back to me, even let me keep the products free..I don't understand why it's only got a c rating. I give it an A+..",5,10/11/2023
Highly impressed with Temu.  Everything comes quickly. I mainly buy skincare products.  They assist with concerns professionally & quickly. I buy regularly.,4,10/11/2023
"For anyone who asks if Temu's prices reflect exploitation, you KNOW they do. It's just that you're too self-absorbed and/or stupid to make a change.Response to Temu: you do not curate, you cut the middleman and gauge customers' desire which is fine. However, economics will tell you that the suppliers can't possibly manufacture at those cheap prices without using products that contain harmful chemicals, & exploitative labour. Disposable, cheap products are bling to those obsessed with themselves & shopping - that's why my original post is directed at your customers.",1,10/11/2023
"Trustpilot allows anyone to leave a review whether they?€?ve bought something or not. I haven?€?t bought anything yet I?€?m allowed to write this review. Temu reviews are just copied and pasted. I won?€?t be trusting trust pilot again, sadly.",1,10/11/2023
Never ever had a problem with these guys and think the bad press there getting is uncalled for i have never been scammed had money taken etc!used loads of times and products are amazing value for money,5,10/11/2023
Strange how every positive review is almost word for word,1,10/11/2023
"I am very satisfied, with their items, speed and service. Example: on my last order there was an optical earcleaner, which I could not get to connect with my iPad. I had a very pleasant chat with them and they forwarded my problem to the manufacturer. I told them after a week that I had?€?nt heard from them and immediately got a full refund without having to return the default one. So far, it looks to me that they do their best to satisfy their clients.????",5,10/11/2023
Product arrived in time and exactly what I ordered. The downside of temu is that my email address is now bombarded with phising and junk email. Won't use again.,2,10/11/2023
"The promotions of TEMU are fraud, they simply dont give any gift to anyone. They are simply using its users with fraudulent and deceptive promotions to get new users for free.",1,10/11/2023
"I've bought quite a bit from Temu. I'm pretty surprised by the quality of their products. Some are what you expect for the price, but many are much better than you'd expect. My only real complaint is how they package the order for shipping. All the items are placed in a plastic mailing bag without any protection. Boxes are almost always bent or crushed and, on occasion, items have arrived broken. They are, however, very good about returns and refunds. Still, I'd rather have what I bought than a refund.All-in-all, not a bad place to buy from if you're looking for inexpensive, usable items.",4,10/11/2023
Just received my order today & I must say that I was sceptical @ first but have been proved wrong as my order went through with no problems & have been kept informed all the way & the added bonus is that I love what I received & at a very good price ????????????,5,10/11/2023
All advertisings by temu are fake. They are never not cheap,1,10/11/2023
"I was dubious at first, having been scammed by another on line company, but have been pleasantly surprised by the quality. They automatically honour their pledge if late. I have ordered many times over a period of three months approx. I have only  not received one item, which was re-sent. Two others were not satisfactory so I was automatically given credit.  Delivery via Evri has been a problem but I hope that has been resolved. If I want something quickly then I compare prices with Amazon Prime. If Evri is a problem then look on the government?€?s website Company Registration and contact the owner via registered post. Temu may have to find another delivery company  but I think Evri will have to pull its socks up if it wants the contract, so don't blame Temu. The packaging could be a bit more substantial but you get what you pay for, and the price and quality are very reasonable.",5,10/11/2023
Some of the products are great for the price but when I?€?ve given a poor review it never comes up. I?€?m sure I?€?m not the only one who has had some poor items from them. Where are the not so good reviews!!!,3,10/11/2023
I have placed the same order twice it gets to customs and that's it . The first order I was refunded so I reordered the same stuff bc they give u credit not ur money back . So here I sit the package made it to customs that's it . Beware u will not be refunded u will be credited to order and wait for weeks for it to come . Bad service and extremely bad delivery,1,10/11/2023

"I had my doubts , took a chance , even if it came I thought the quality would be off but it wasn't ! Good quality for the price !",5,11/11/2023
"Made first order couple of weeks ago and it's turned up today. What you see is what you get. Don't think you gonna get top notch goods. What you pay for is what you get. But all items did turn up, they all work and tbf I'll be using them again. For what it is, the company is really good. Only reason I give 4 stars is because I've only used them once so far. Will update to five on a second successful delivery",4,11/11/2023
"I never got all 7 items of my order, but I received 1 out 7 items . The order was left outside and it was completely opened. I paid $ 67.46 for one green sweater that I would not try it on.  It's tampered with. Does this make sense ????The other 6 items whoever stole it, their enjoying it . Maybe the courrier company ???? I will return the sweater I got but I can't return the whole order because I didn't receive it. Ignorance, I used to order often but now since they didn't help me it's time to scrap them.I have to get a visa dispute because the customer service agent & Temu robots dont want to help they keep on saying the same question.  I sound like a broken record! Avoid, really do not care! Customer service need to get training!!The went back on their word. They will not reimburse me. Their scammer.",1,11/11/2023

"Horrible customer service. Two of three packages never arrived, third was returned, can?€?t get refund after over six hours with Temu agents. Stay away",1,11/11/2023
"So far I have made 5 orders and the packages have all arrived within the approximate ten day delivery time.Depending which courier they use (done on package size) quality of service is a bit hit and miss.  If you are unfortunate and get it allocated to CORREOS SPAIN then it will invariably be a total hassle with incorrect information and lies regarding delivery attempts that never happened.SEUR are just as bad but MRW have currently got a good track record.The quality of the products given the value for money I find about 10% are total rubbish, 10% are going to be short life and the rest are no worse than high street shops. No worse than buying big brand names to find you paid for the name not for quality.Returns can be made locally in most cases free of charge but my 10% junk is put in the bin as I know overall I am in profit.TEMU is very useful, the items come from China but don?€?t most things anyway.  Cheap labour is a fact of life, it?€?s not my job to be the morality police.",4,11/11/2023
Ive Received 3 consignments of parcels from temu I haven't any issues with them the t-shirts are all nice tops are fine l bought a few small toys they were also good l can't fault temu even if it's a Chinese company l live in the UK,5,11/11/2023
"Couldn't decide whether to give 4 or 5 stars, ended up giving 5 because tbh, they've been great! Was a bit worried with first order because I've been caught out before with a scam company, but really happy with Temu, shopped 5 or 6 times with them now (just placed another one) and I'm really impressed with the shipping time, every parcel has arrived more quickly than expected. Yes, some things are 'a bit cheap and nasty' but overall I've had some amazing items at amazing prices! I love that the clothes are true to UK size (which makes a change!), usually I have to guess and end up with something far too small lol The only other thing to remember is that you have to spend a minimum of ??20 with each order, but there's so much to choose from it's easily done. (I've dated the review as 1st October, but I can't remember the exact date, plus I've just placed another order)",5,11/11/2023
"The items I bought are not as advertised, basically they are cheap and shoddy, for example I ordered what was advertised as a teenagers thick thermal lined winter coat, it wasn't. My dogs raincoat is thicker and warmer. This company should be avoided. The leggings I ordered her are see through! They went straight in the bin. I'll never use this site again + recommend nobody else does. What makes it worse is it's usually people like myself on a low income that get stuffed. AVOID.",1,11/11/2023
"Packaging arrived absolutely disgusting, water inside and dirt. I had to throw it straight in the bin. I had ordered two orders around the same and and both orders were crushed together in the same packaging. Package went straight in the outside bin. Contacted Temu who said I had to return the items. I had to state multiple times that this package was in returnable, it was in the bin.Over ??50 of wasted money.I asked for a email address multiple times but was never given one and there seems to be no email online. I tried one but the email was undeliverable?Obvious scam who take well earned money from individuals.I?€?m so disappointed",1,11/11/2023
"**1-888-480-8368 is Temu's CSR #I have purchased a LOT of items from Temu.  It's a definite learning curve, regarding buying from them, aka doing business with them. I started to use the word ""goods"" rather than items, but----I found that word to be ironic, because suffice to say----not all items they sell are worthy of being called goods.  They're not going to voluntarily inform you that, ""Oh, by the way, valued customer, you need to check your orders listed in your profile for at least 30 days following purchase, because if a price adjustment (ha--gotta' love dynamic pricing, smh)is made, for you to get credit back you need to request that the difference be issued back to you, in credit.  They also aren't going to advertise the fact that they try to coax customers into writing reviews, even if it's only just 1 or 2 words, ie: Nice!!  or Wow!.....& so many of the reviews are submitted by that coaxed customer almost immediately after receiving their purchased item.  Now, tell me this, how can you properly review an item, if you haven't even used it yet?  Stating in the review, that it ""looks"" good, does NOT mean you've actually tried an item, regardless of what that item actually is.  Also, you want to scroll, and I mean SCROLL all the way through the reviews, because it seems that in some instances, the negative reviews, somehow find their way to the bottom, & just how many people even read the reviews, much less scroll and scroll and scroll through them to simply just skim through the wording.  I'd mentioned dynamic pricing........but really in some quite a few instances, there is no real rhyme or reason as to to price increases.  A seller may have an item featured in 3 to 5 different sizes (for instance a bear paw shaped dog bed), and three different color choices.  The small may be a wonderful bargain then the next size up, the medium size dog bed, may be priced HIGHER than the large dog bed.  It seems that ultimately some prices are based on popular choices...they know they can attempt to charge more for something if that ""something is coveted, and in demand.  To expound further.......they also do not forthrightly tell you all about everything listed in your profile......truly, how could they even take the time?  People I've spoken with who have purchased from Temu, the majority of them aren't even aware, that listed, amongst the various headings in your profile info, is the section:  Earn Credits and Free Gifts.  And, if you do not ever bother to click on it, so as to open & explore what it means, then you're not going to be curious enough to then click on the Temu Exclusive heading.  Within Temu Exclusive, if you apply & are accepted, are chances to  earn discounts as well as rebate rewards offered, provided you apply for, and fulfill the requirements necessary to get you that rebate reward (such as checking in daily for 7 days in a row.  With the comprehension difficulties that can arise, not only complicated by language difference, but the fact that while they're chat CSRs are located at a Phillipines call center, and while they do actually have a customer service phone number (which is 1-888-480-8368) it seems that the head offices are still, of course, in China.....and ultimately no matter how helpful their chat CSRs & their **phone CSRs can be--ultimately a final decision can end up being in the hands of their China based offices.  THE PREMISE OF THEIR REBATE REWARD OFFERED WITHING TEMU EXCLUSIVE, IS WHAT REALLY HAS ME UPSET!!!!  i HAVE GONE IN CIRCLES TRYING TO GET THEM TO COMPREHEND JUST WHAT HAPPENED, BUT IT FEELS AND SEEMS AS IF THEY ARE LITERALLY AVOIDING DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM, VIA SAYING TIME & AGAIN TO ME, VIA EMAIL ESPECIALLY (A AGENT BY THE NAME OF ALEXANDER) THAT THEY can NOT find a record of what I am explaining AND RE-EXPLAINING TO THEM.    i HAVE JUST ABOUT HAD MY FILL OF THE ENTIRE COMPANY & THE WAY THAT IT SEEMS THEY CURVE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE AS THEY SEE FIT.

"Shocking?€? would not suggest anyone uses this site/app.I had been enjoying their Farmland in app game, those of you that are familiar will know that you have to complete little challenges and share the app with friends and family to try and win certain selected items.I had shared the app and didn?€?t receive the bonus, simple mistake I assumed and contacted their customer service team?€? turns out their customer service support teams are absolutely useless! They initially told me the my friend had already downloaded the app which is why I didn?€?t receive the bonus (this was incorrect) so I pushed for escalation, the second team claimed they couldn?€?t find a user (using the same information already provided) and asked for further details of the person I refereed. When I asked why I had already been told she had an account [because it looks like, I was told this to avoid getting my bonus], the customer service agent flatly advised she would not answer the question or provide any further support?€?Shocking company, fraudulently offering rewards and not paying, do not use, delete if you have it, and don?€?t trust this site?€?.",1,12/11/2023

I was only wondering from where this bag was send, I couldn't find on the app correct location. It says just Temu. Must be fake one. I heard all coming from China so doubt in a good quality????So thank you and I just hope it'll last.",5,12/11/2023
"Poor experience. I am a regular temu customer and my package was lost as it was left outside in the open by Evri despite the fact we were home. Multiple discussions with Temu customer service yet they didn?€?t bother to address it and brainless agents kept saying ?€?the package has been delivered ?€? although Temu policy clearly states that refund will be issued if package is lost. I wont be using temu again. They are fraud and scam.Now Temu has pasted a generic bot reply here without reading through my text. They havent gotten in touch with me at all. This is the third parcel that I did not get even though i was home. They say they put it outside but that is not true. I waited the whole day for this. Even if this is being done by Evri?€?s team, it is Temu?€?s responsibility that it gets to me. Three parcels lost and now they say they are not refunding. They take a picture outside my house and it just vanishes? I am sure there is something very fishy about this.",1,12/11/2023

"jerky company.  the post office allegedly sent an order slated to go to upper michigan to st. paul minnesota.  they tell me to call the post office to deal with it.  after several incorrect reports as to the date it would be delivered.  agree with other critics; avoid this company---when i asked for my money back, they repeatedly tried to provide me with temu credit instead, telling me over and over the money will be available in minutes, while i'd have to wait days for refund from my original payment source.their response below is ridiculous.  i checked a few credit ratings and found that in addition to the numerous complaints online they don't have a good rating with the BBB, for example.  they provide bot answers that don't address questions. google bbb temu rating and read the reviews there too.  check sitejabber as well; their formulaic responses to real issues are offensive.",1,12/11/2023
"I purchased my tenth order from Temu and it?€?s been more than prefect.This online shop definitely is not for an emergency buy but if you have time then it?€?s perfect. They have thought of every little thing.  Their return policy has been betterr than my Amazon prime, no question asked every time.You can buy from cheap to midrange items and enjoy the low cost shopping.Thanks to those who made this possible and hope it?€?s here to stay and become even better.",5,12/11/2023

"Rate would be zero if possible. Shopped with TEMU since early 2022. I had basically been satisfied or returned items. I?€?ve spent tons off money. It was so easy and returns were free. I did like that the refunds came fairly fast and correct. Especially if you let the refund go your account with them.  Then I started getting duplicates of several of the items from different orders like over $200 total. It took multiple calls to verify I had received and been charged multiple times. That call somehow was conveniently not available to them. I ask about the calls being monitored and recorded. According to their message on their phone when you call in.  Could they not go back and replay after spending numerous attempts to get my refund. I was told to mail one item of each duplicate. I received the return label and I mailed the package. Over two weeks and I?€?ve received notice today of two refunds one was $6.44 and one was $4.74. I suppose that is all I am going to get. They claimed some they didn?€?t receive, lies. Some was not packaged according to their terms. But I have realized I have basically been scammed out of a considerable amount of money. They have been deleted and blocked from all my Internet services. I advise that no one else tried to use this company.",1,12/11/2023
Great experience. Just received my 2nd order from Temu. Very happy with the style and quality of the products. No issues with delivery and it was timely. Definitely will continue ordering from them.,5,12/11/2023

Temu is fine. I?€?ve been really happy with some items for the price and really underwhelmed with others. The ones I?€?m not happy with I?€?ve been able to return and some items they haven?€?t wanted back and have just given a refund for straight away. The emails and texts are way too much and to be honest are more irritating than do anything to inspire me to spend more but you can get some decent bargains on the site if you?€?re careful and realistic about what you?€?re ordering. I?€?ve generally been pleasantly surprised so far.,4,12/11/2023
"I am a fairly new user of Temu and prior to using them I looked at all the 1 Star ratings. However I bit the bullet and gave it a go. So glad I did. Everything I have had so far from t-shirts, torches, tools & associated parts has been good and at a very reasonable price. I will continue to use Temu as in my book they are a good company.",5,12/11/2023

I wish I could rate 0 start. They never deliver ontime. After several months they refunded my order as a credit and not to the original payment card. So I had to order something to use that credit. Again after few months they cancelled the delivery and refunded as credit. I don?€?t want to purchase anything again but they have not left me any option. I need my money back on my credit card on the file not account credit for my future purchases.I read your answer. My experience was different. Temu gave me credit not full refund on my own card. So it?€?s an obligation for me to purchase again and I don?€?t want to,1,13/11/2023

"This is a good shopping app. Some of the quality of the products needs to improve. The only downside is the delivery . It is very unexpected and it can take over 9 or 10 days to arrive.

"To begin, I am a genuine buyer who does not write fake reviews!I like many others was very hesitant on using Temu after reading so many negative reviews and posts. I thought I'd give them a chance and placed a small order and I was very please with the delivery time and the goods received. I've since made another couple of purchases and have had no issues with those either.I understand that some people have had concerns about there data being shared and receiving a lot of spam, I do receive some odd calls and emails which I know are from scammers but, some of these were happening way before I shopped with Temu, I even lost one of my social accounts due to being hacked by spammers/scammers. I have in the past received emails from reputable companies advising me that my data may have been compromised so it's likely that my data has been circulating for some years and comes back to the surface every now and then but this isn't down to Temu, if I do feel the need to change my review because of any issues, I will do so.I also log in via the website and don't use the app as I'm not always comfortable with the amount of permissions needed, I'm not sure if this makes any difference but on the website, I can select the amount of marketing emails/sms I wish to receive and haven't yet received anything that can be classed as spam!",5,14/11/2023
"Saw some negative press about TEMU, but put a small order in to see for myself.It was delivered early- bonus! The stock is of decent quality- as good as you'd find anywhere else.

"I made an order for ??140 and the parcel was supposedly left on the floor in my communal post room. The parcel wasn't there when I checked, and Temu have refused to refund/resend the parcel. The only way to contact Temu is via live chat which I am doing almost daily, and they are repeatedly sending the same scripted responses, without reading my messages properly, and closing my ticket without a resolution. They won't allow you to escalate to management and don't have an official complaints process. I would warn anyone to not shop with Temu as if a problem should arise, their customer service is terrible and they will do all they can to get rid of you.",1,14/11/2023
"I wanted to place a large order with Temu but being a little sceptical and wondering why the items were so cheap I placed a small value order. The order arrived when stated and was as described. I then ordered something else and received the same service. I took the plunge and ordered my my large order which have arrived (when stated) and I have to say are really good value for money. I even returned one item because it was too small and was given the choice of a refund or credit to my account. I chose the credit and it was in my account within 10 secs. Great value for money products and great service!!! Will be using often......and....no, I did not get paid to write this review.",5,14/11/2023

"Fantastic service. I always have reservations buying items from an outside the uk, especially all the way from China. I had doubts about Temu. But I took the plunge and ordered a few things. They arrived promptly, before the estimated date. Next, I ordered items again, but this time, they did not arrive?€?,not because of Temu, but because of Evri, the delivery service. I got in touch and they refunded the first part of my order as Temu credits. Got in touch with them and explained I preferred refunds back to my card account. I also made them aware that my refund was incomplete as there were two orders packed under one delivery (they had refunded just the one order initially). After a brief misunderstanding with one particular agent, Temu reached out to me via another, more understanding agent. They sorted the refunds for the second order and also promised to send the already refunded Temu credit back to my account in a few days. True to their words, the cash is back in my account. This, to me, is the surest way to gain trust. They are 100% genuine and do take customer care seriously. The products themselves, those that arrived, were as described. Cheap but effective. Ill definitely be ordering more now. I fully trust them. I want to shout out to the second agent (can?€?t recall name) who sorted things out. You?€?re a credit to Temu.",5,14/11/2023
"Overall it is exactly what you expect. It does work, but shady knockoff type of work. It is cheap.  This is a modified review.  Originally I had them at 3 stars but I'm updating to 1 star.  They challenged my review and that tells me they have done it to others for no real reason.  Just because they want a 5 star? Some stuff is good.  Some is bad.  None of it is great.  You will throw sone out.  Keep some.",1,14/11/2023
I mad an order that I never received. Typical Evri took a picture of the parcel dumped on the drive which was never there and Temu would not refund as marked as delivered. I took this to Evri who admitted fault and said I need to go back to Temu so they can start the claim process so they can refund/resend my order. Temu still refuse to do this. I?€?ve send 5 cases now via the app and they have rejected them all saying I?€?ve got the parcel even though I?€?ve sent proof from Evri that?€?s not the case. They have basically stolen my money. They will add a dumb comment to this saying contact us via the app but you will get a robot response. I will now be reporting them to trading standards as they have refused 5 times to give me my money back.,1,14/11/2023

Still waiting for my purchases,1,14/11/2023
I have to say I was very sceptical ordering anything from China assuming it was another rip-off outlet such as Shein who are impossible to deal with and return items to after discovering they wouldn't fit a 6 year old and absolutely nothing like the picutre.Anyway I needed a new hat for Hallowean and read the reviews and thought I'll risk it and give it a try.I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in about 8 days despite advising it would arrive 31 Cct-2nd   Nov. Its not top quality but exactly what I would have expected for ??15 for a cheap fun outfit and it did look like the picture! I can assure  you I am not paid to leave a review and usually only review when I have a whinge to make but   thought fair's fair - all the truth.,4,14/11/2023
"Very upset with Temu. I place an order every week with them, yesterday they had a ?€?cat bed?€? reduced to ??7.04 so I added it to my basket. I went to checkout and it was ??15.48. I contacted Temu and the advisor told me to still place the order and they would refund the difference to honour the price and to let them know when I had placed the order, so I placed the order went back to customer service baring in mind it was still the same agent as the chat never got closed and he said no we cannot refund the difference. Customers BEWARE !!!! If they do this to valid customers they will do it to anyone. So sneaky getting me to place the order first then tell me no refund difference in price. UPDATE: they have asked for order number and I don?€?t know why they had it yesterday. The messages on here the Temu replies are always ?€? chat to our online agent?€? but that?€?s a waste of time their agents don?€?t do anything.",1,14/11/2023

"I finally caved in to the hype and placed two orders with Temu. I think I got 40% off, some kind of spin the wheel deal. Too good to be true. When the order came, I threw at least half of what I received away.1. Incense cones: smelled like burnt sawdust, not agarwood or anything nice;2. Plastic food bag sealing clips - dreadful. I bought some at Ikea, which showed just how cheap and flimsy the Temu clips were;3. Lavender drawer sachets: smelled weird. Mouldy maybe?Temu invited me to post a review on their site. However, they make it impossible to do so. You have to order through the App for the best price deal, but can only do the review on your laptop (as far as I could work out). But there are no login details except on the App, so impossible to find one's account...Temu is strange. It really does feel as if there is an ulterior motive to get us to sign up. All the deals are for this first time sign-on, and thereafter, the site is just odd. You can't find anything on the App - you have to scroll through what they choose to show you. I think there must be truth in the rumours that it just wants our data.",1,15/11/2023

Two times a product has come in broken and they refunded my account immediately and didn?€?t want me to return the product.  I have ordered lots of jewelry, clothes, garden lights, lots of gift items for all ages.  When I see something advertised that I like, I go strait to TEMU and check if they have it.  Most of the time they do at a third of the price.  They have excellent communication with tracking your order too.",5,15/11/2023
Pleased with my purchase.Good value for the products I have chosen for myself and my husband. Delivery time as promised. Would recommend this company. MH,5,15/11/2023
Signed up today had bought items then said if I spend another ??20 I would get ??100 coupon. Didn?€?t realise it was going to be for 15% if you spend ??40 20%if you spend ??60..etc. just thought that was misleading and to have to use by a date as well.  Asked for more info on review. I was expecting a ??100 to spend without having to spend more money. ( if I spend ??20 get ??100 coupon to spend.) only you have to spend ??40 to get 15% and so on. So you don?€?t get ??100 coupon you get %off. So misleading. Hope this helps,3,15/11/2023
It told me I was going to get a 100?? coupon if I brought 20?? worth of items but at the end it gave me different coupons that I would of had to buy more stuff Eg. A 20?? coupon if I spent more than 60?? It didn?€?t tell me that so I didn?€?t know it was a scam pretty much,1,15/11/2023

First order and last order with Temu. Nothing I got was what I ordered!! Trash!! Please don't waste ur time or money!!,1,15/11/2023
Temu is a blast to scroll through. It's a fun site to buy from but keep in mind that the prices usually predict the quality of the product. Electronics are near imposable to understand do to the fact that the instructions are translated by individuals who are working with a serious language barrier. Neat little fact. No matter the product you can return anything free of shipping and depending on the price of the item Temu will allow you to keep the product rather then pay the price to return. This means satisfaction is garenteended. Risk free shopping. Customer service is excellent! Bonus tid bit the games are a waste of time. It's just their way to recruit others.,4,15/11/2023

"Although the products are cheap quality, (what do you expect for those prices?).  Their customer service is second to none.  Just when you think everything has gone to the dogs, there is a company you can still call and speak to someone who actually resolves your problem right away, or you can chat with them, they organise a refund for products you are not happy with, with no questions asked, the products are unbelievably cheap and delivery prompt enough.  I applaud their desire to care about their customers.  It's something that has become otherwise distinctly lacking in this day and age.

"Temu , took my money and never sent goods they have scammed me and will not correct the problem even when I have been trying for 6 days . They took the money , kept the goods . Customer care is none existent. They don?€?t care I have 18 pages of chat . They just repeat and do nothing . I want to physically speak to someone but no one helps . They ignore messages , tickets . They just steal your money and items. They say ?€?reach out to us for help, our customer service team are here for you?€? no you?€?re not absolutely a lie.

"I have bought from TEMU a few times inc for my mum and I personally have never had a problem,I?€?ve always been happy with my items.they offer very quick delivery-Around 10 days.In the past I?€?ve bought sensory and communication equipment and a men?€?s black hooded t shirt for myself-I got the biggest size  and it fits amazingly well,material was to thin but I wear a vest under it.the only negative I can offer is the design on my mums blouse was a mess- they had clearly used a small square of design and the pixels were then over stretched! They need to design with a much bigger resolution.Always look at the reviews on site of any product you are buying, especially pay attention to those with photos of the item you want and no matter how time consuming it is always put on reviews of each item yourself as it?€?ll help other people choose or avoid.",4,16/11/2023
Obvious fake reviews on app stores and garbage advertising,1,16/11/2023
I've made 5 separate orders and ALL have arrived in a timely manner. Only 4 stars because some items are poor quality. A bracelet that felt good quality tarnished and fell apart after 2 weeks - it was ??1.98 so it wasn't even a gamble. I've ordered a range of cheap products most are OK and one or two are not so good. But for the price and free delivery what on earth is the problem. I've never sent anything back and why should I. It's cheap as chips and it's a lucky dip with some good quality amongst the cheap stuff. I'm happy and I love Temu.,4,16/11/2023
"I have ordered 2 times and the products are with very low quality!Now I started some task to release 3 ""free gifts"" but this is SCAM! THEY WANT TO PROMOTE THEIR FAKE PRODUCTS AND THEY WILL NOT GIVE ENYTHING FOR THAT!",1,16/11/2023

"X(x7)XXXXXX-Sub.Zero Rate/Review.Boy, Temu just tops, or rather stoops to a new low, to the bottom of the ocean where the whale's sh__s are!***** For those of you who are new to Temu, like me, getting these $5, $35, $100 off coupons at check out... BEWARE that you DON'T GET A PENNY OFF FROM THE FAKE CHECKOUT COUPONS!@#$%^!At the check out my bill was deducted, reward for ordering extra, to a specified amount-$. Check, clicked order & pay. I received discounted coupons in various amounts on every order, the first five (5), from $15 to $100. Just looking at my CC charge statement and noticed something is off! went back and looked Temu orders details, and audit one. OMG, the $35. discount coupon was applied when the order was placed, ""thank you"" and all, but I was charged the full amount!*  My mistake was: TRUSTING a CON, Temu. DID NOT take any screenshots of the checkout/orders with the discount coupon applied.YES. That's right YOU/the customers don't get the discount coupons even if it was applied at checkout/order, unless you call cust.serv and provide proof - that is what the woman says, ""you/customer (me) need to prove that you had a coupon applied to your order!"" OMG, changing the charge after the customer leaves the site! Then have the ball to say that it's the customer's responsibility to keep a record!@#$%^*  Yes. It's the customer's responsibility to provide a receipt for a return or any issue afterward; however, these were online purchases, and the seller, Temu has all records in every customer account. It is a criminal act, a fraud, illegal to show $150./or whatever with $35. coupon, a total bill of $115.00 at checkout/ordering point; then charges $150./ without discount applied, and required customers to call, submit proof/ a screenshot of the checkout w/ coupon applied, in order to get the $35.00 credit - oh, by the way, it's a credit to buy more, not a refund! *  The other option, according to the bank, is to wait 30 days and file a charge contest with CC co. still need proof, the screenshot shows the lesser amount for that order ($15. deducted/applied by Temu),     *  Why do I/any customer first-time customer spend over $500.00 on cheap trinkets made in China, and have to go through any of this!? Temu discount coupon to up-sell is a total scam.*  Yes, cheap stuff, but full of scams every which way you look, and sent craps, defective/broken, used, no label or instruction, smashed box, items that looked like they've been through a hurricane! Everything was squeezed into a plastic bag, shaped into a pillow, taped, and mailed!*  Yes, 90 FREE returns; don't know how that works yet. out of the 300 misc ordered, 15 to 20% will be returned from those issues. Am I allowed to send them in one box or am I required to pack each individually, a deterrence/making it difficult for customers to return!?*  Yes, cheap giveaway kinds of stuff for events; nothing of substance/heirloom is available here on Temu. Sad, we live in a world of con men - honesty, and customer service are not a part of their being.*  Whatever you buy here, be sure to take a screenshot of everything, and be prepared to contest the charge through your CC co. If you have never ""talked to the brick wall,"" try Temu cust.serv; that's how it is.",1,16/11/2023

"I like the fact that it has an installment plan option (Tabby/Saudi Arabia) for many of their items but their items are limited, unlike Aliexpress. I can't find many of the items that are available at Aliexpress, and I'm still not sure about the quality of the products they sell, and the whole experience of ordering from them. Their items are not necessarily cheaper than Aliexpress's, in fact, some are even more expensive and they don't have many other options. But I do like having the option to talk directly to their customer support, unlike AE where you can only talk to the sellers.",2,16/11/2023
"2nd update:  Temu did not send what I ordered, I requested a return/ refund which was ignored. I messaged again, and complained. Temu never communicates with you directly, although they have my email. They only bother replying through an official 3rd party website like trustpilot, and then it is a meaningless reply you get. You don't get a refund. You don't get the product you ordered [they could easily send it but they choose not to]. The upshot: I am out of pocket, with a product I cannot use.  DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE SLICK WEBSITE WHICH LOOKS LIKE YOUR PURCHASE IS ASSURED. IF YOU WANT TO DO SAFE ONLINE SHOPPING, STICK TO AMAZON OR EBAY [as much as I dislike ebay, at least they follow up complaints]. 1st UPDATE: Temu's 'cancel your order' link doesn't mean you get your money back!  I checked my account again in case Temu did issue a refund after all with delay. However, no refund was issued, and on my Temu account page no mention is made that I had a lengthy chat with staff who advised me to cancel my order  because they had packed an item I did not order.                                                                 Original review: I checked my order and saw that Temu had not honoured my choice of colour for the gloves I had bought. I had a chat with one of their staff and they said I could cancel the purchase, which I did. I now checked my account and have seen that they did NOT refund me, and that the unwanted item was not removed from the package and is now on its way to me. I am rather angry at this and would advise anyone not to buy from Temu.",1,16/11/2023
Bought a 'Addis Dive' watch and a watch repair kit.The watch worked well for a few days then I noticed the border on the date window was not attached to the face anymore. It fouls the hands depending how the watch is orientated. The watch is faulty and only encountered normal daily wear without even being wet and still failed. I looked into the refund policy and it is AWFUL! I wouldn't even get enough back to order the exact same item. What a scam! As for the repair kit I have used parts of it for a few things and state the components are cheaply built and will need to be replaced with quality items over time.It may be chance but the increase of spam emails to my account has been drastic after dealing with this app.I have deleted the app and will look elsewhere or better yet not buy junk!,1,16/11/2023
"In my personal experience Temu are a brilliant site for purchasing many quality products at a very reasonable price. There are some very useful gadgets to help with everyday life. I have had to request a couple of refunds when item missing a part or Item not as described but have been issued a full refund within 2 days with no return required. The shipping for small items is always free and delivery is most often within a week . My only advice to buyers after reading the reviews is to use PayPal with a linked Credit card not paying with just a Visa Debit as PayPal & Credit Card companies will guarantee your payment and will raise any issues with any suppliers on your behalf; whereas banks will not always guarantee this . Also be selective on purchases check all accompanying photos and check pricing on available colours as prices differ. My only grievance is when you are given a ' money off your next purchase' offer, this expires after 24 hours, perhaps they could consider the offer applying for 1 or 2 weeks instead.",5,17/11/2023

"On the whole my experience with Temu has been very positive. Among other things I bought a tablet. I checked the price on Amazon and it was slightly cheaper on Temu,but I had been awarded a ??40 off voucher by Temu when spending over ??100 so I was quids in. I have been pleasantly surprised at the quality and fit of most of their clothes. Some items have been tat, but at under a pound I have just laughed and put it down to experience. Be careful that you get the best price for any purchase as the same item tends to appear more than once with various prices. Now if I want to buy an item I put it into my basket from several sources and buy the cheapest.",4,17/11/2023
"lol Temu keep mass reporting my negative reviews and getting them removed... Clearly trying to hide the negativity of their company..... lolSo here goes... 3rd time of uploading the same review... (I have it copied and pasted, So will continue to upload it, until they stop spam reporting it and getting it removed)Well, Temu Fishland.. Where do i start?!?!I opted to feed fish, to win a Beofang CB Radio for ??27.99....First of all.. the first few fish are easy to complete, In a couple of feeds... But the last fish!!! WOW!!!!Took me 7 months to feed the last fish.... Every day, Logging in, Earning all the free fish food i can.... And buying from Temu too, To give me extra fish food....First 50% or so, seams quick and easy enough....But when you get to around 70%, It REALLY SLOW DOWN!Each feed only gives 00.01 percent, and earnings drop too.. Instead of 30 for each Mealtime Reward.. You get 10... So 1 feed....But i kept grinding at it....When the time limit runs lower, It automatically renews and gives you another 40 days... All good. So i though, No Problem...Well after 7 months of feeding each day, I got to 98.37%.. and the timer didnt renew.. It ran out!!!!Like i said, Thats with logging in every single day, Earning all the free food i can.. Aswell as purchasing from Temu too, to earn me extra fish food......So 7 months of my life, totally f**king wasted.....What a scam!and dont even get me started on the amount of spam pop ups you get CONSTANTLY!!!!They are unblelievable, and highly frustrating.....Safe to Say.. I wont be using Temu Fishland again!!!EDIT: Since i originally put this review on.. I tried Temu Fishland again, Simply as a test purpose, To see how much of a scam they are...So i chose to feed fish, to get a free item thats 99p to buy from Temu (a little plastic car radio antenna)....And behold.... So far, Im 15 days into it..... 15 days!!! of logging in daily.... earning my free fish foods... Searching items for 45 seconds to earn fish food.. and loggin in to earn the mealtime rewards too....So getting as much fish food as i possibly can, without buying from Temu store to give me more fish food.....And 15 days!!!!! And i still havent even finished it!!!!15 days of feeding fish... To get a 99p item!!! and im still not very close to finishing it either!!!! I estimate, I've got another week or two, of constant feeding, to earn the item.. THE 99p ITEM!!!!This is how much of a ripoff it is!!!!At the top of the page, it says ""earn ??*.** more to get you're free item""....... Well each time you fully feed and collect a fish.. You earn 2p... Then once you have earnt that price stated.. thats when you are finished and get you're item for free....Well when i first started it, it said ""earn ??8.70 more to claim you're free item"".....-- I have to earn ??8.70 for temu... and login every single day, for multiple weeks..... To win a 99p item!!!!(obviously this is how it works... You earn more than you're items value.. Because you are earning temu money too.. Thats how they can give you the item for free... it isnt free... You've bought it via game time, advertising etc... and you've also earnt alot more.. So temu earn their bit too)Absolute f***ing joke...... and this is why i will continue to post this exact same review.. No matter how many times they spam report it and get it removed!!!!",1,17/11/2023

"UPDATE after TEMU replied me:- Order ID: PO-167-01048790958710901- I've been in a chat session with your colleagues today, right before I wrote the review, but the outcome of our conversation was deplorable! I shipped the damaged items and other I don't like in a robust cardboard delivery box, despite your laim bag I received it, squashed and deformed, but I haven't received the confirmation nor the delivery status in your app, hence I got anxious and very frustrated! Just now I have finished a chat session with TEMU customer service and they proved me I have lost my money, when I returned a package with damaged and faulty goods, and they're asking me to wait until the shipment arrive to its destination, in the warehouse to become inspected, even though TEMU is ALWAYS shipping items you are ordering, only in bags and ALWAYS you'll receive the article inside squeezed and damaged, but when you want to return these, you are forced by the carrier (DHL & Cargus in my case) to use a robust cardboard shipping box,... what a mockery!I have undoubtedly lost my money (roughly 40,00 ???) but perhaps everyone who is reading my comment here, will take necessary precautions and avoid this fraudulent chinese platform!The reason Temu does not accept payment via PayPal is because they can't steal your money through them if your transaction with their products goes wrong, even if you make the proof of sending the receipt and applying for a refund!Temu won't compensate anyone who returns their products, they'll just bombard you with hundreds of ads and collect your personal and bank details to be sold on, to hackers!",1,17/11/2023

"Don't buy anything from Temu! They lie about giving rebates (it's always coupons even if they don't state that) & credit is a joke. It's always just more ""discounts"" to try to keep you buying their junk which is still overpriced even though it seems cheap. Plus, you can't actually cancel with the cancel option since they say right away it's being packed & prepared to ship. If you try to talk to anyone to cancel, they'll just put off responding to you for as long as needed to make it look like the items have shipped and then tell you it's too late to cancel. They're just trying to falsely boost sales numbers!You can't trust that you'll get a refund (you'll just lose the items if you ever had them and lose the money), & if you pay with something like PayPal you will lose your dispute since they can just make up and show any tracking number they want as ""proof"" it was sent. Electronic items are cheaply made, they don't hold a charge & they overheat while using them. Regular products aren't worth the price when you can get it at a Dollar store or similar place quicker and cheaper. Terrible company full of lies and false advertising.

"I have been shopping on this site fir a few months now. I never had any issues with returns and I was always refunded promptly. Sometimes even before the package reached the warehouse if using RM returns as they refunded me as soon as I dropped the package at the PO due to my good customer profile. I often use the same label for items from several different orders to save them money for postage costs. On the one occasion I use Evri for my return they accuse me of not returning all the items listed on my return request. I know they were all returned as they were all in the same temu package and they refunded me for the other items. I have filed a claim and if I do not get the rest of my refund in 3 business days I will no longer continue to shop with them. They clearly have either incompetent or dishonest warehouse staff. This has upset me as I have never experienced this with any other online company in all the years I have been shopping online. Temu, you need to sort your warehouse staff out!

This is my first order and I had 10 items with 7 orders free.Absolutely amazing and all items were great quality. I had one item missing out of my first delivery but I contacted customer support and they will send a replacement or I could have had a refund.My orders came in 2 Deliveries and was kept in touch frequently regarding the tracking information. I highly recommend this company.,5,18/11/2023
My 5 orders were delivered as promised.  Happy with every item except one garment and they fixed the problem immediately.  Great prices since there is no store expenses.,5,18/11/2023
"?€?.waited 10 days after the promised delivery date of a mere 20$ order. At which time Temu basically said, ?€?We have no f**king idea where your order is.?€? Ordered items were promised to others. Now I have to explain Temu?€?s incompetence. Will not be ordering again.Edit?€?order placed Sept 28-29?€?",1,18/11/2023
My order never arrived. Still no refund. Order should have been here 8 days ago. Not getting anywhere with online chat. Is this company real? Or do they just take your money? Where is my refund,1,18/11/2023
"I was sceptical at first so only spent ??10 on my first order. It arrived on time and everything was nice quality. I have since placed another order and intend to do my Xmas shopping on the site.  An example on Temu they are selling a set of makeup brushes in a case for ??1.97, another website is selling exactly the same set ??26!!!!! Yes unbelievable,  but it's true.",5,18/11/2023
I have two outstanding orders from Temu which show that they have both cleared customs in the U.K.  One cleared two weeks ago and the other a week ago. Ervri just show that they are waiting for the parcels. Temu don?€?t seem to have a good grasp on getting U.K. deliveries sorted.On a positive note many of the items I have ordered have been good value,3,18/11/2023
Always arrives early and the quality for what you pay is generally very good.,5,19/11/2023
"I ordered stuff from Temu two times prior to this last time that I ordered. I finally felt comfortable spending a little more money since my previous orders did arrive. They sent it this time through a company called piggy ship. And initially I was getting a lot of tracking updates. And then all of a sudden I stopped receiving them and then when they would update, it would only update the date not the actual process it was at. It was in transit for weeks on end. When I contacted customer service because I tried calling the shipping company number and it does not answer, I was told that it?€?s just processing. I told them the tracking is never updated. It seems as if my package is lost and they continued to assure me that it?€?s still just processing. Fast forward to a month after I ordered. I?€?m getting a refund because my package is NOT coming, but if they would?€?ve fix this the couple weeks before when I contacted them either resent the shipment or refunded my money they would not have lost the customer. It was pretty obvious that the package was lost and a five or $10 credit is not gonna cut it.",1,19/11/2023
"So I have purchased goods from Temu before and things were fine.But with my last order I had to return 6 items of clothing because of poor quality and wrong size.I returned via Royal mail and got proof of postage that also tells you the weight of the package you are returning.I received confirmation that they had received my package and that their was going to be no refund for 3 of the items as they were part of a deal buy so many items get some free.But I would get a refund of ??37 for the other 3 items of clothing.After not receiving my refund I contacted Temu, who said that although my package had been received at the warehouse when it was checked it had nothing inside.So I would not be receiving a refund.I have complained and Complained. But all I get is the package was empty.After asking for a review they now say that they did receive my package but the items I said I returned were not the item barcode that was scanned.They continue to ask me if I did indeed return said items and had I got proof of putting them in the package.Then an email saying could I check at home to make sure I had returned them.Because the warehouse staff say they have not been received I will not get a refund.You cannot reply to emails, you can not telephone or get them to call you. You can only do things by chat.I have done 6 chats and the same email reply is the same, the bag was empty, no goods received. But an empty plastic bag would have no weight.I know I sent 6 items of clothing back. But I cannot get a refund. Please be careful. Yes if you buy something little and you have a problem they give you credit for said items.But I sent back 6 items of clothing in good faith.I am being branded a liar and a thief.??37 is a loss of money I can't afford to lose. But my integrity is the problem.I am just warning people to take care if you do have to return goods.",1,19/11/2023
Delivery. Great price.,5,19/11/2023
My order didn?€?t arrive. I contacted them and was asked to check my letterbox? I had ordered garden furniture.  They also asked if one of our neighbours had our order . We live in a small village and it was a large order so again that wasn?€?t the issue. They still haven?€?t sorted this out. This has been going on since August.,1,19/11/2023
"Goods exactly as described,and very cheap,the size guide in every piece of clothing is as it states,delivery on time but ??5 no quibble refund if late.I have placed 3 orders all perfect",5,19/11/2023
temu.com refused to refund me.I received nails painting set instead of 2 PS4 wireless controllers!,1,19/11/2023
I had an issue with a parcel that useless EVRI have possibly lost which after an hour of live chat was eventually resolved and my Clearpay account refunded. Other than that no complaints. I have ordered twice from Temu and I will order some beautiful floral print tops as they are extremely reasonably priced and usually very quick delivery as they probably come from the Far East. Keep up the good work Temu.,4,19/11/2023
"Deceptive product titles. We ordered a pack of ""solid merino wool "" sock ans what we got were 80% cashmere and 20%elastan.Then, when we checked the produc specifications it did indeed say cashmere and elastan. Then why the hell do they put in their title something that the product is not?Scammers!",1,19/11/2023
"Excellent customer service. Rarely do I get something that doesn't look like the picture, and when that happens they have refunded my money IMMEDIATELY.  They gave me a $5 credit because my order was one day late.  Many US businesses could learn a thing or two from TEMU's business model.",5,19/11/2023
Generally surprisingly decent stuff considering the very low prices.,5,19/11/2023
I had received a shipping notification stating my order would be delivered by end if day today and my order was in Doral FL. I went on the shipping companies site and tracked the package and it isn't even in the usa yet!!! Customer service were terrible and couldn't tell.me why I received this just that if I don't receive it by x date then I get a 5.00 credit. I.have ordered a lot of things from this company but this is my last. Hate dealing with liars,1,19/11/2023
Don't let these bad reviews fool you temu is brilliant. I have placed three orders in a month it's so cheap with unique products. I had an issue with gateway not delivering my package but saying they did and I signed for it. I contacted temu and after explaining I was immediately offered a refund or reship I chose refund and now just waiting for it. 10/10 customer service so happy. Next order is posted by an post too,5,19/11/2023
"I'm honestly surprised. Having seen the trustpilot reviews I was skeptical because they were very hit and miss. I couldn't resist the website, soooo many things I love. I ordered a small order, about ??20. Arrived on time, with no problem, and the quality of what I bought really pleasently surprised me. I was expecting wish crappy quality for cheap prices but instead recieved really nice items. I'll have to try them again!",5,19/11/2023
"Such a freaking scam!!! I have invited NUMEROUS people for the $200 to be won, and a few have accepted and joined.

"I've order products using my phone & my my computer, for some reason they can't find all of my orders when I have to make a return. This lack of cohension in there system coupled with the poor quality of some merchandise has stopped me from ordering. They need to copy Amazon's system if they want Temu to grow. I'll hold off until I see a better system for tracking my purchases regardless of how I ordered. Same address, phone number & email, why can't they find my oreders.",2,19/11/2023
"Beware of false information designed to trick you into making a purchase! You might see products advertised on Facebook for as low as ??1 or something similarly enticing, but when you add them to your shopping basket and proceed to confirm the payment, the total cost isn't displayed. It's nothing like what was shown in the Facebook ad. Don't get caught in the trap of falling for these heavily discounted promotions.It wasn't until I checked my bank account that I realized how much I was actually charged. The final cost was nothing close to the offer price advertised on Facebook. I didn't even bother returning the items, as doing so would only waste more of my time. However, I feel compelled to leave this review as a warning to others: don't fall into the same trap.",1,19/11/2023

"EVERY OFFER IS A CON!!Invite friends and receive ??130 via paypal.invite friends to receive your 3 free gifts.Play a game and feed fish to get free gifts.Spin the wheel and always win a top prize.Only they will only link enough friends to leave you one short, which is just enough to stop you from claiming ??130 via paypal money or free gifts.If you complain and can prove friends followed your invite link, they will add a friend and the invite friend bonus on a day that you've not invited any other friends and it's added just before the time limit expires, so it is pointless and you are forever chasing and inviting friends to receive gifts etc that you will rarely get.They just want phone numbers and email addresses.EVEN THEIR COUPONS ARE A CONGet ??5.00 off when you spend ??5.01Only you have got to spend a minimum of ??10. This means in order to use the coupon, you need to fill your basket with ??15.00 of goods. which isn't a bad deal, although it's not what the coupon says.As for the coupons, you place your first order, and receive ??200 in coupons. MY ADVICE, PLACE THE ORDER TO GET THE ??200 IN COUPONS, AS THERE IS NO MINIMUM SPEND, AND IT'S OK VALUE FOR MONEY, THEN WHEN YOUR STUFF ARRIVES, IF IT ARRIVES, DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT, THE APP AND FORGET ABOUT THIS COMPANY. The ??200 in coupons you receive, you only have 2 days to use them. But don't worry, they throw coupons at you every other day.They claim free delivery on everything, but you see a countdown ""order within however many hours and minutes to receive free delivery"" but it's always free.Edit: on the 18-10-23 Temu tried to have this review removed. I provided them with user name, cash code:  469336800 and mobile number so they can find my account.I HAVE CONTACTED TEMU CS, I AM STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO REPLY.",1,19/11/2023

"Ordered about 11 items from Temu.  3 were not fit for purpose, 4 just about fit for purpose.  The other 4 ok. I requested a refund on 3, immediately told that all 3 would be refunded in full.  My first purchase was similar, 2 items good, one grossly not as described even though expensive for Temu.  I can definitely recommend but expect that the price is probably going to reflect the quality.  All items arrived and in good time.",4,19/11/2023
"The items are at low prices for a reason, the price does equal the quality. I got my husband a flask for work but water was cold within 2hrs and I mean cold not even like warm.

I have placed 5 orders in September to now and 2 were to get extra points to play the games and if I didn't have extra money I couldn't and that's sad to me.There rules for the games aren't explicit enough and to me it's not that serious because I can pay fory free items instead of waiting to get them for free.I like temu because some of there clothes is on Amazon and the prices are totally different.

I've ordered twice from Temu now and yes some of the stuff is tacky but what do you expect for those price. If you just want basic household items it's great for that and nowhere else compares on price. Amazon should definitely be worried as their prices have crept up and people are now realising they can get things cheaper on Temu and with free delivery too. Aside from the quality of some of Temu's products the only downside I can see if delivery obviously takes long as everything comes from China,5,20/11/2023
"It was all going great and I was loving everything TEMU, until I received an order with half of my products missing and Temu refused to refund me or accept that the missing products were missing. Disgusting company.I have spoken with TEMU on several live chats and they do not stick to the stated policy below. They advised that they shipped the full package but can not provide evidence of this and will not refund me. They have no complaints procedure so I have no where to take my complaint.",1,20/11/2023

Ordered 5 times from temu and not had a problem at all. Just check the sizes of what you want to order and be sure you're happy with the size. Some things can be deceiving but it usually tells you how big/small they are in description.Delivery is usually 7 days. This is 100% not a scam. Happy shopping everyone,5,20/11/2023

And I bet most people will forget and then they genuine bad reviews will be deleted. Anyway I replied and again I got the same automated email that my refund has been processed which it?€?s not true. I still haven?€?t got my money back. Yes Temu may be cheap and great until you received a faulty item and asked for a refund. I have waited more than a month for my refund. They ?€?claimed?€? they have refunded me and I have checked with my bank a few times my bank they cannot trace it and when I emailed Temu a few times all they do was replied with automated email.

"Stuff is very cheap so you get what you pay for. Haven't used everything yet so can't comment on everything they sell but they DO get it to you. It isn't a scam site in that way. They DO send a LOT of emails. I had to cancel my account and open up another I don't read very often, but I did this for another reason as well. Please note: I have NO proof of this but as soon as I started buying from them, after years of clear alerts from my All Clear Account that checks for suspicious activity all over the web I got an alert that the info I use with Temu had shown up on the dark web. ???? So I had to change a lot of passwords. It made me think that this is how they might make their money. Now I'm not stupid enough to think ANY of anyone's info is truly private anymore, so I check ALL my accounts, credit reports and charges about every 2 weeks anyway, but this is the first time I got an actual alert and this is the only thing I had done differently since the last alert, so just be careful.I read Temu's answer and it isn't a matter of calling a bank. My credit protection software alerted me for the first time that my information was turned over to the dark web just after I placed orders from Temu. That is what happened. Contacting any particular bank is useless, and I stated I had no proof. I'm just putting it out there for people to be aware that this happened, and the timing of it.",3,21/11/2023

I contacted customer services and they couldn't offer me any resolution - replace the missing items or a refund - because the warehouse had verified it had been packed, which definitely wasn't the case as they wasn't in my delivery.I tried for over an hour to get a resolution but could not speak to another representative or escalate my problem. So now I'm about ??30 down.While on chat I read dozens of complaints like this about TEMU on trust pilot and other review places.

"as a frequent temu shopper i see this as a winner , do not beliveve the ""oh they are trying to steal info and that rubbish, it is the middle men (it goes factorys middlemen , amazon ) are worried they are losing profit. howerver temu is direct from the factories , and they are happy to get some of the profit , just enough to pay workers ect. its basicly a better amazon (apart from if you wanna get actual brands like apple , logitech ect)",5,21/11/2023
Wasted money ordering from this company. Most of the stuff either does not work OR it is terrible quality. I.E. CARPET TRIANGLES to hold rugs down just peel away; Magnetic curtain ties do not hold the curtains because the magnet is not strong enough. I could go on but what is the point? When you try and return they make all sorts of excuses. Do not waste your money.,2,21/11/2023
My wife bought a pest repellent plug! Cheap and dangerous copy of an original product pest reject! She's got electrocuted and the product broken the wall plug as well!

Do not trust TEMU they are a fraudulent business who post pictures of garments that have ZERO comparison to the items you receive. I ordered a large number of T shirts based upon the pictures but what was sent looked like dish cloths! Seriously the quality was a joke. I retuned the garments and received notification of receipt but guess what - NO REFUND! I tried contacting them but they mysteriously cannot find any details of my order and now they?€?ve deleted all information from my account. This is not only disgusting behaviour but must be fraudulent. I can prove I?€?ve paid for the garments but TEMU hide behind faceless chatbots and pretend they are being helpful when they clearly don?€?t give a flying fig. DO NOT TRUST THEM,1,22/11/2023
"I must admit I was dubious about trying another site after trying a few that either sent out junk or charged a fortune for postage. Temu has now become my go to shop! Yes I could get it tomorrow from somewhere else but I would rather wait a week and have the same or better for often less than half the price. Everything is as described and the one time I had a problem it was dealt with quickly and professionally. I fully recommend Temu, so much so that I?€?ve deleted three other sales sites from my phone this week.",5,22/11/2023

"First I am here to say this is a real person a real review!! I honestly have to give pretty big props to TEMU especially with the sizing of their clothes I wear plus sizes and anytime I've ever ordered from other companies that are similar, IE WISH, ???? which everything comes and turns into WISH you HADN'T!!! Most of the time the clothes that came from there wouldn't fit any size human cuz a lot of times they weren't even cut properly I digress, everything I've ordered from TEMU thus far has come fit perfectly just as ordered!  And as far as quality of their other products is it high dollar stuff not so much but then again you're not paying high dollar and I picky and choosy about what I buy from there but so far everything has worked out great!!  My only complaint is my own inability not to get sucked into binge shopping, like I often find myself doing at Dollar Tree!! Anyway I felt inclined to leave a review because there's lots of naysayers on here but thus far I can only speak for myself I've had a great experience so thanks for your products keep doing what you're doing!!",5,22/11/2023
i placed my first order. the small order is being processed. 3 times i cleared a second order. 4 times it was accepted and confirmed. then cancelled and i was invited to reorder. now the order will not be here on time. customer service kept giving advice on using my card and how to order even though each time the orderr was confirmed and then refunded. i could not get to communicate with anyone else. i was given an a ticket and advised to just keep checking. if you are waiting for an order think twicebefore opening this app,1,22/11/2023

"I have recently purchased two mobile holders for cars from an online retailer. These products were advertised as high-quality items with a visually appealing design, and the prices seemed incredibly tempting with a discount of 60%. However, upon receiving the products, I was deeply disappointed to discover that their actual value was not even close to 2 euros. This experience has led me to conclude that the website from which I made this purchase is engaging in fraudulent practices. Therefore, I strongly advise against purchasing anything from this particular website.",1,22/11/2023

So I thought I'd give Temu a try and it's not too bad.Products are cheap but for a reason!! Don't bother with the games Fishland offers you free gifts but makes it impossible to get them. Temu draws you in you pay for what you get ( no frills ) and the rest is promised gifts that are ridiculous to actually get. Disappointed and wouldn't recommend.,3,22/11/2023

Absolutely no complaints here. You get what you pay for. And I have had some lovely items. Definitely unsubscribe from messages and turn off notifications for the app though. There's far too much advertising. My phone was constantly buzzing. I bought a bathmat for 74p. The quality was surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting alot. But it's lasted months. And washes well too. You needn't size up like shein for clothing either. Very accurate.,5,22/11/2023

"TEMU IS NOT 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE.Due to my experience lately, I sent back two packages with tracking number which I requested for refund. Even I got proof from Canada Post and their customer service agent that both parcel had already arrived to the warehouse. But the warehouse can denied the delivery. They give hard time to the customer for getting refunds. I am wondering whether it's concerning about honesty or problems in their policy. I had to email them back and forth and without solving the problem. Those experiences just make you frustrated. Every agent gave different answers, one said the packages were not there, and the other confirmed the shipments are already arrived in warehouse.Honestly they don't deserve have one star. VERY DISAPPOINTED AND NOT ORGANISED. CUSTOMER DOESN'T DESERVE THOSE EXPERIENCEAfter I wrote a review yesterday, surprisingly I received an message from TEMU this morning. IT MENTIONED AFTER THEY REVIEWED AGAIN THEY DENIED THE REFUND FOR ANOTHER TWO ITEMS WHICH WERE APPROVED YESTERDAY. UNDERSTAND MY SITUATION I WOULD LIKE TEMU HEAD OFFICE TO GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION.

Other frequent complaints were regarding not getting refunds and the Company?€?s poor customer service.  I?€?m here to tell you I have been using this app and make purchases regularly.  I previously used WISH but shipping would take 6-8 weeks ir more.  I am thankful to have discovered Temu!!!!  The only negative complaint I agree with is there is not enough protection when packaging items to ship.  I have received broken merchandise more than once.  With that said, my dealings with their customer service were prompt and refunding was immediate.  In one of my orders I was really disappointed with the quality of the item and my experience with customer service was top notch! I cannot recommend Temu enough!!! Their prices can?€?t be beat!

TEMU is only agency. They have not their own stock. The are conduit for Chinese retailers. It is only tell about quality. Especially for clothing items Item return involving a photo for the item. It is not worth the effort to a low priced item. As TEMU is dealing a large of Chinese traders it frustrating to your money back.Regrettably I am retuning to Amazon.

"This is an edited review, after ""another"" costumer service kindly stepped in. I was refunded from all products I sent back, which were not found apparently. To have a honest review, I have been using TEMU lately and from all shopping I have never had a delayed package. There are different qualities of products as in every shopping platform. Refund is usually ok and sometimes you can just keep or gift the refunded products (which is actually more environmentally friendly than sending the products back :) ). As stated below (original review), I had a problem when returning item (usually more expensive). I had several conversations with the app service support, which told me that there were 3 items missing from 7 returned and 1 unidentified item. Then when I challenged this, I was told there were 2 unidentified items. When I again challenged this, I was told that likely I still had them lost in my house, instead of being lost in a huge warehouse that already told me different things... I asked to please provide a picture to help identify these extra unidentified items, or that at least they send them back? The reply for this was hilarious: ""After investigations by the warehouse department, we found out that there are 0 unidentified items"".So, I am thankful of this external costumer service, however, the warehouse in Germany has a lot to be desired... and sorry, but I am not surprised about the German costumer service!Original review:  Return and refund is non-existent! Prices were quite cheap some time ago. Now they have been levelling up, still cheaper than Amazon. HOWEVER, I never had any problems with a return-refund in Amazon, instead, my first return to TEMU (I packaged everything like it was a gift in their original bags), they apparently received half of the items I sent, and a few unidentified items? They are not doing anything about it and I lost my money and the items. This was my FIRST experience... imagine those statistics!",3,24/11/2023

So regularly we get several days of tracking with promised delivery dates but then at 6pm ""we're sorry we couldn't deliver today. We will deliver next working day."" But that's a lie - they don't - and it's the same thing over and over until Friday or Saturday.

"Temu Exclusive offers credit back on orders.  Before placing an order on 10/6, I took a screenshot of the Temu Credit Back Calculator.  I then placed said order.  My credit back was short $35.  I placed the order for the sole purpose of receiving credit back.  I contacted customer service and was ""chat ended"" , transferred twice before I was told my concern was being escalated and I would be contacted by a supervisor.  They would not put the order on hold until resolution (which would make the most sense) Three days later I am still without resolution and the order has now shipped.  I will probably be forced to send the entire order back.  I once again placed an order via Temu Exclusive on 10/9. (this time they were advertising up to 50% credit back on orders $80+.  My order was closed to $90, and I was only given $2 and change in credit back.  ????????????????????????.  I should have received $40+ in credit back (excluding taxes)... I promptly cancelled the order.  Temu Exclusive has become very unreliable.  In the past, I've experienced about a 80% success rate for the credit back.  My last two attempts has lowered that success rate substantially.  It should not be roulette.   Totally disappointed.*****EDIT:  Temu customer service agents awarded me the missing credit on 10/11/23.   I am updating the star review from one star to three stars.",3,24/11/2023

I received what I expected which was poor quality materials (everything was cheap polyester) and also found that sizing was way out on a couple of my items; the size large item came up like an extra large and the size extra large item came up like a medium. I?€?m not one to shop at Primark but would honestly say that their quality is far superior to Temu and the prices for similar items would be cheaper. The other thing I didn?€?t like was the games aspect of Temu - is this a way to get people hooked onto games and shopping?  There are no freebies!  Only cheap quality junk!!!",2,25/11/2023

However what was clear is that they had given my information to this company and when I thought I was actually buying the box it was getting me to sign up to their website and they have taken out over ??35 in two days.  No refund applicable !",2,25/11/2023
Absolutely fantastic service. I have placed hundreds of orders with Temu lots of bargains on the website. You can shop till you drop for a fraction of the price you would pay on other online platforms. They offer free returns and if the delivery is late they give you ??5 credit.

"Orders arrive quickly. Maybe a week after ordering. Quality is not too bad but check all measurements before ordering. Don't just go by the picture. Also, it's impossible to get an answer about any of their merchandise.. The sellers are not contactable directly and even then, it's such a hassle. I never DID get my questions answered. Be prepared to trust your instincts. I've had some good buys...mostly good considering the price.",4,25/11/2023
"Temu's Epic Failure - A Masterclass in Incompetence and NegligencePrepare yourself for a tale of utter despair and incompetence that can only be attributed to Temu, a company that has truly perfected the art of delivering disappointment. My recent encounter with them has left me baffled, frustrated, and convinced that they are in the business of making customers' lives miserable.The saga begins with Temu's audacious claim that my eagerly awaited item had been delivered to my doorstep. They even had the audacity to back this up with a photograph, a photograph that proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they had delivered it to the wrong address! Yes, you read that right; they delivered my precious package to someone else's house and had the gall to call it a successful delivery.Naturally, I reached out to their customer service team, naively expecting a swift and reasonable resolution to this absurdity. Instead, what I got was a masterclass in how NOT to treat customers. Their representatives displayed an astounding level of incompetence and a stubborn refusal to acknowledge their colossal mistake. I offered to send them a photograph of my house as proof, but it was as if I was speaking a foreign language.In a breathtaking display of ignorance, Temu's customer service team insisted, time and again, that the delivery had been carried out correctly. I can only conclude that they are either completely out of touch with reality or genuinely believe that their customers are fools.What's even more infuriating is that they made absolutely no effort to rectify their blunder or find a solution to the problem they created. They simply brushed off my concerns and left my valuable item unaccounted for, likely left to the mercy of thieves on the roadside.In short, Temu has set a new low for customer service, and their delivery blunder is a testament to their breathtaking incompetence. This ordeal has been a stark reminder that Temu cares little about its customers and operates with an astounding level of negligence. I implore you, dear reader, to steer clear of Temu at all costs unless you enjoy being treated like a second-class citizen and having your valuable possessions vanish into thin air. Temu's disgraceful performance in this matter should serve as a warning to anyone considering doing business with them.",1,25/11/2023
"I have no problem with Temu. I?€?ve received everything I have ordered. I?€?m not going to complain about the quality because if you Gotta pay ??2 for something it?€?s not gonna be the highest quality ever you get what you pay for. I have had a few issues with delivery things being broken, but that?€?s the third-party they use to deliver their items that is not them. I have had absolutely no issue receiving a refund for anything that?€?s arrived broken, I sent them pictures on the chat and as I know I?€?m going to order something else I asked for Temu credit which is in my account, within three minutes",5,25/11/2023

I live on an island and it seems the courier on the mainland received the package but then did nothing with it. Temu contacted them and gave me updates on a regular basis. They also credited my account with a 5 euro goodwill gesture which was well appreciated. I am now doing a second order. Customer service was excellent.,5,27/11/2023

OMG my favorite company to order from!!! I'm addicted. I find pretty much everything I need on their app. Everything is affordable. I thought when I first started ordering from them that their products would be made so terribly and cheap but every single time I get a package in the mail everything I've bought has been worth more than the price I paid for it. Also it doesn't take too long for shipping either.,5,28/11/2023

"I was initially worried about ordering from Temu, but everything went just fine!  I ordered 6 tops and one jacket plus a lot of different small items.  They all arrived promptly and in excellent shape.  The tops are all made of a sort of polyester that is not like the jersey I am used to, but they wash beautifully and don't need ironing if I take them out of the dryer right away.  The only item I wasn't crazy about was a pair of earrings, but that's on me.  You can't logically expect fine jewelry when paying a few bucks!!!",5,28/11/2023

"I am a relative newcomer to Temu, having placed my first order with them in July 2023. There?€?s tons of stuff on site and I always find myself roaming around looking at other things. Having read some reviews before ordering anything, I was quite concerned at the number of bad ones.  I know things can and do go wrong when ordering anything from the internet, even ordering physically in a shop, so the first few things I ordered weren?€?t expensive and I used the experience as a test purchase.  I was pleasantly surprised at the speed of delivery, and the relative quality of what I ordered. To be honest, it?€?s not all brilliant quality, but if you?€?re getting something very cheap well then, you?€?re not always going to get top quality goods, but l have been more than happy so far. Just one cautionary jot, order clothing sizes at least two sizes bigger than you would normally buy, as M, L or XL are not the same as the equivalent sizes in European clothing.  I also always give honest reviews of the goods I purchase, whether it be good or bad.  I placed two orders recently and they both arrived last Tuesday 03/10/2023.  One item out of each order had to be returned, and I was very pleased at how easy it was to return them. The most expensive item to be returned was a jacket for ???50. The jacket was fabulous but just too small, the quality was superb and it was waterproof.  Such a pity they don't do a bigger size as I wouldn't have hesitated to re-order it. Temu have to be complimented here, because the refunds for both returns actually arrived in my account on Wednesday 04/10/2023.  I am still staring at it in amazement.  That?€?s a good news story from me regarding Temu.",5,28/11/2023

"Website is crammed with so much stuff, everytime I've placed an order I end up adding more to the basket ready for the next order. Lots of quirky stuff which make great gifts, if I've had issues with items it's refunded immediately without returning items.

"OK so after being pestered by my teenage daughter about Temu and how good it supposedly was, all her friends use it etc...I finally gave in and allowed her to order a few bits. The ring broke as she put it on her finger, necklace was nothing like the picture and the earrings were mismatched. Utter junk...I've had better quality out of 2p machines. At least she saw the funny side and I will be pestered no more!",1,28/11/2023
"Firstly delivery is a bit ""hit and miss"" very much like their products.  ""You only get what you pay for"" and ""if it's too good to be true, then, it probably is"" are two sayings which come to mind and are spot on when you deal with Temu.  I ordered a duck down pillow which turned out to be better than I could have wished for, but it was not cheap.  Other items were low cost and poor quality.  Remember this, you are dealing with a Chinese company, and, in my experience they are very experienced in producing low quality copies of high quality items.  Anything that you buy from Temu will be serviceable and up to the job for which it is intended,  but if you pay a low price for an item why would you expect it to be of the same quality as a premium brand.  Lower your expectations and you may not be too disappointed.",3,28/11/2023
"I'm semi-new to Temu. I accidentally stumbled upon them, and looked around, as i innocently kept adding items to my cart. Not realizing, 2 hours had gone by. Ugh. I'm not kidding you, they have everything, YES everything. AND anything you could think of, too. I have adult ADD-ADHD and I struggle with keeping myself organized sometimes. However, I just found the best invention, to help me with that problem, and it was on their website priced at a whopping $1.24. Truthfully, my orders are usually a little larger in quantity, cuz after I place the actual order, they let you add items with one click. If you are impulsive ypu may wanna log out. Needless to say, there's no such thing as one ""ONE click"" with them, you have been warned ;) I am 100% happy with ALL my purchases, don't get me wrong, they have so much odd yet good stuff that you keep saying to yourself, ""Oh yeah I meant to buy this"" or ""Oh I've needed one of these"" or ""So & So would love this as a gift"". They have such good prices you just can't stop.. you really can't. Plus so far I'VE NEVER PAID S&H yet. I used to shop on the app, Wish pretty religiously, and EACH item had its OWN SEPERATE s&h fee. NO discounts. NO bundling breaks, NOTHING. Lets say for example: I bought 2 toys at $3 each, they were exactly the same, at the same time and from the same buyer. I would pay $6 for the toys and tthey'd tack on a $3 s&h fee 2 times. Since I bought 2 identical  items, you would think... NOPE. I paid $3 s&h for each toy. The worst part is if you buy say 4, of something, yes, you paid s&h 4x and it didn't matter the quantity of items you bought, you paid a s&h fee PER every item. Sadly, 99% of the time, all was shipped together in the same bag, anyways. Not Cool, Wish, not cool. Either way, I somehow found Temu, and I'm glad I did. However, I actually had a lil glitch with my most recent order and I just finished up a live chat with their customer service. I have NO clue, if my words were not making sense to agent?? I kept repeating myself it seemed & I kept getting aggravated. After almost 40 minutes, and going nowhere. Ugh. The agent abruptly said... ""blah blah blah, Thank you, blah blah blah, goodbye"". Not one suggestion to fix my glitch, nothing. I typed ""Wait don't leave me yet"" and he was gone. I see someone typing and I'm glad he left, cuz a NEW agent named ""Vega"" took over. I TRULY don't believe everyone is cut out for customer service type jobs. Vega"" just blew my socks off. Very understanding, patient, attentative, etc. By now an hour had passed and Vega came up with a great solution to my ""lil glitch"" and all is fixed in say 20 minutes and ALL is good again, Thank you Temu.  Keep up the Good Work!",5,28/11/2023

"I placed an order on Temu, initially for some bicycle pedals. They also offered me a 'new user coupon' which I obviously accepted, but it was necessary to use this for a slightly larger order value... so I selected some other products I had been looking for given that they were at a reasonable price and added these to the order.They ship the items in groups rather than all combined. One of the packets arrived with a large hole in it and I discovered the original bicycle pedals that had triggered the order to start with were missing. The hole in the packaging was quite a significant size (not just a few scrapes and scratches from being thrown around) and smaller items were still inside the packaging which made me suspicious that this item was targeted and taken intentionally out of the bag.I messaged Temu on their chat (the only way they offered for me to get in touch). After a rather tortuous process, I was eventually elevated from the 'bot' to a real person. The first person told me to follow and accept the automated refund process and select the refund as Temu credits as then they would be immediately available to spend given that they had identified another seller with exactly the same pedals at the same price (as the seller I used was out of stock). I followed the instructions only to find that there were only 2 sellers on Temu with those pedals and both were out of stock. Additionally, the first customer representative had told me that I would have some money taken off my refund because they pro-rata the coupon that they originally provided, but they would provide an additional coupon to ensure I did not pay anything additional when I repurchased the pedals. Clearly, this was not possible as there were no available products to purchase!At this point, I asked for a full refund to my credit card but their bot and subsequent customer service have refused to engage further! I have therefore bought the same pedals from a different online retailer for $5 more than Temu was offering them for (around 5% more).So, if you feel a 5% discount is worth the headache of not getting reasonable customer service then take the risk... I for one will no longer be shopping on their website...Update: Following publishing the reviews above, I had a further interaction with their customer service. They did in the end refund my credit card and they provided additional Temu Credits to supplement the difference for the item missing. Whereas I accept that this is the hoped for outcome; it is still disappointing the process required to get to this point. Because of the Temu credits provided, I have subsequently placed a further order on the site to get the benefit of the credits. I hope this time around there will not be any complications.",2,28/11/2023
i have placed at least 5 orders and which its delivery date is not on time and they wont credit the $5. And package is in customs. only clothes and kitchen items. Will never order from this website. Shien is way better and no sitting in customs. Rather pay for the $3.95 shipping.,1,28/11/2023
"I placed two orders with Temu, l never received an order number from them, l received instead  an acknowledgement and order number with tracking advice from a company called Yttornt , they also were paid from my credit card.

"They use evri who dont bother to turn up but lie and say they attempted.Update: Added 2 stars as quality of products has exceeded expectations. Also everything was sent as one package as opposed to wish/ali express. I am unimpressed with evri who delivered, I waited 11am-13pm when they stated it would arrive, nobody came to my front door (which was open) they sent me an email saying they were unable to deliver as i wasn?€?t in, which is preposterous as i was looking out the window for them and my door was open, I did not appreciate being lied to. I complained to evri and they said they would redeliver between 14.30-16.30. When 16.30 arrived i still had not received my package and i started a live chat on your website to let you know how unprofessional evri were being (I did receive more than satisfactory customer service). I then used the tracking to find out were my package was, at 19.30 to find it had been delivered at 19.20 to a safe space which is fine but they were very late and didnt even bother knocking.

Made an order. Never arrived. Tracking said it had not left China. Had difficulty getting help. They then suddenly said it had been delivered. I had not received it.

This being my first return was free return shipping, for which I was eternally grateful. My account was credited when they received.

It's are as described and shipping was fast.  They do send lots of follow-up offers but it's been worth it. The prices are tremendous.",5,30/11/2023
"The company is not bad, the items they sell are to 99% of good quality, however depending on the shipping company there can be problems. Uni uni delivers without any problems usually on the first day the delivery is suppose to be done, no problems at the customs, however Straight ship seems to always have problems at customs, I am waiting for 6 packages shipped with straight ship and they are all stuck at customs and  3 are late and the other will be also late. All packages are suppose to be going with me to Cuba in 6 days .  So temu should get rid of the one shipping company",4,30/11/2023
"Very slow shipping. I?€?ve ordered from Temu for the past 2 months. Recently, the shipper they use has been changed (Straighsh??p instead of Uniuni). Shipping is slow and shipment has been on custom clearing for over 5 days!Updated on October 5th: Temu has offered a reimbursement since I still haven?€?t received my order. Great customer service!",4,30/11/2023
This rubbish little company sent false/faulty goods and failed to respond to my complaint.,1,30/11/2023
"Temu is fine, until you get someone elses order by their mistake. Their customer service online is a shambles. I've spent over an hour online, still unresolved. My order is shown as part delivered, but its not what I ordered, god knows where that is. The customer service staff have no idea how to resolve issues like this. I still haven't been advised what to do with the parcel of items that I haven't ordered. I wont be ordering from them again. I was told to keep the items sent in error to me, which I have absolutely no use for! - Temu contacted Trustpilot, and said ""temu.com has flagged your review because they don?€?t think it?€?s based on a genuine experience"". So I sent them back the actual order details, proving it was a genuine order, and proving my issues. Then I received the below response from Temu after attempting to get my review removed. Since then, I have placed in fairness three more orders with Temu, the products I ordered & received were decent quality on the whole, and cheap. So I am upgrading the review stars to be fair.",3,30/11/2023
Temu is absolutely rubbish. They have NO telephone number & NO email - NO way to contact them. Live chat is NO use. Please give email or UK telephone number. DO NOT USE.,1,30/11/2023
"I placed my first order for 10 varied products of sunglasses, shirts, jewellery and scarves. The order came quickly, and have to say, everything came in as well above expectations. Several bracelets are lovely, scarf passes for branded prints and the sunnies are terrific. Who knew! Would have easily paid 10 times the prices and been happy. Shirts were a slightly odd cut - sleeves a bit long, but I ordered over my size to allow alterations if needed to give me room across the body (for big Australian frame). Easy to alter, and Im happy to have terrific print shirts for low cost.Now i went back and ordered another large mixed bag, but this time the order got stuck somewhere after arrival in the country and failed to progress after Australia Post started to track. I left it for a few weeks before raising a ticket with Temu, and wow! Kid u not! Online chat I flagged missing order, and the service agent was lovely. Just said essentially - fine, do u want credit or refund? I was surprised as i thought they would commence long process of investigation and i would wait for some time.  Within 2 minutes i received my choice of Temu credit on my account. Brilliant customer service and now im a devoted customer!Good job - genuinely impressed. Try it out for yourself",5,30/11/2023
Awful quality. But then you get what you pay for. Clothes are cheap but look awful. Badly made. I won't buy again.,1,30/11/2023
I?€?ve had some ok stuff but then again some are just cheap Chinese rubbish. It?€?s hit and miss. So far I haven?€?t had a problem with delivery. So far.,3,30/11/2023
I really liked my experience with Temu. My purchase came in time and it was exactly as in the website. I will definitely purchase again.,5,30/11/2023
"Up to now we love temu. Prices are amazing,products good value for money. Only time, I was disappointed when I ordered crystal bracelet and it came out made from glass. Some things are cheap quality but you get what you pay for. Majority of the things are nice and we using it a lot",4,30/11/2023
"More than happy with my purchases so far. Bought a lovely soft rug recently for my front room, less than 20 pounds and I love it! The slippers are soft and comfy the nightwear comfortable and a good fit. Take a chance, you may be surprised. I'm not saying it's all good but the prices are insane!",4,30/11/2023
"actually, i found nice items on it...",4,01/12/2023
I like Temu it's just the watches everytime I charge them they won't switch back on,4,01/12/2023
Looking at reviews some of them look very similar which makes me believe they are false and just trying to get you to shop here.  I have experienced this sort of  review before and was scammed.Until people post honest revews for this app I will stay clear.,1,01/12/2023
"DO NOT USE this company, Don't trust this company, complete bunch of con-artists. Shipped my parcel as purchased, Evri relief courier decided to deliver anywhere, and all I got from Temu was to be offered ""tracking Updates"", refused a refund or to reship STAY AWAY from these people!This eventually got sorted with a full refund after Evri finally admitted responsibility. It should never have got this far.",1,01/12/2023
I have had 3 deliveries from these now with numerous items ... absolutely fantastic service fast delivery and great prices ... heard all the horror stories but I'm actually well pleased definitely recommend you try this company.,5,01/12/2023
"Great in the beginning but now delivery starting to get long let etc, products becoming poorer. Watch out if you play the games as they take away rewards if you refund anything and also don?€?t get the full value back. Now made over 30 plus orders and spent quite a lot of money for both their products and to get regards for games. Now TEMU messaged me saying they are going to STOP people using multiple devices etc but so far all talk and no action. Also this site is for reviews so TRUST PILOT you need to stop people posting their codes on here!!!!!!",1,01/12/2023
"I have ordered many things from Temu in the range 0-60 Euros. Ok, not everything is perfect. But the service has been very good for me. Never missed anything.I am happy and going to try so some more household items.",5,01/12/2023
"Excellent value and almost as fast as Amazon Prime, although you have to add an extra 3 days max if you are desperate and it is a large package you can pay 9.99?? for next day!I recommend you to be patient as they will email every hour with tracking information I filled my wardrobe full, seriously including a wintertime time coat for so little I saved ??60 on M&S coats starting price",5,01/12/2023
Got product..totally faulty..Can't even return becoz cost more then I bought..Really disappointed..Never again..please stay away ...,1,02/12/2023
"I have nothing but praise for Temu.  Okay, some of the clothing items are perhaps a wee bit small, but then you go for a larger size.  I have ordered a number of pieces of jewellery and novelty making equipment and all are excellent.  The service is super quick and efficient and I look forward to receiving every parcel with the items I have ordered, because I know I shall be happy with them.",4,02/12/2023
"I've been using Temu for almost a year now, and there's a few things that I need to address about it:No, it is NOT a scam. Temu is very similar to AliExpress, but the shipping is 10x faster (my packages arrive in about 2 weeks after ordering). I've personally saved over $1,000+ on Temu, and they almost always have promotions that make things even cheaper.On the other hand, there is a few concerns that I have about Temu, mostly about their free credit games. While I have been able to get over $2,000+ in credit by inviting new users through their games, they are a little bit shady. For example, they tell you that you're 1 point away from getting $100, and when you invite another user to claim your credit, the new user only counts as 0.1 points, so you need to invite 9 more new users.Overall, Temu is a legit company with great customer service, but there's definitely a few things they can change to make it a great app for everybody. I'm very impressed, though!",4,02/12/2023
"This is a spam app and they will make fool of you when their delivery partner cannot deliver the order on time and puts the blame on customers. On top of it TEMU do not take the responsibility of it irrespective if a customer complains several times and TEMU do not refund the order. They play politics and will always try to prove you wrong because they know they have messed up.To your recent reply, kindly be advised that I have already deleted my account with you following your NON ACCEPTANCE of the fault you made previously and ongoing one and on top of it your team started manipulating and politics. Therefore there is no option for me to give you another chance since I have already complained with you several times and there was no action from your side.",1,02/12/2023
"I wanted to share my recent shopping experience with your platform, Temu, which, in my opinion, has its share of pros and cons.First, let me highlight the positives. Temu truly lives up to its promise of offering a wide variety of products at incredibly low prices. It's a paradise for bargain hunters, and I appreciate the affordability that the platform provides. The extensive range of products available is impressive, and the ability to explore different categories is a definite plus.However, I must admit that my journey on Temu had its fair share of hiccups. The primary concern was the quality of the items received. While I expected budget-friendly prices, I also anticipated a reasonable level of quality. Unfortunately, some of the products I ordered turned out to be made from extremely cheap materials, which affected their durability and overall value.Another significant drawback I encountered was the shipping time. It took significantly longer than I initially anticipated for some of my orders to arrive. While I understand that low-cost shipping might lead to longer wait times, I feel there is room for improvement in this aspect.In conclusion, shopping on Temu can be an adventure with its unique mix of affordability and challenges. While I did find some fantastic deals, the experience was somewhat marred by the quality of certain items and lengthy shipping times. It's essential for potential buyers to weigh the pros and cons carefully and consider whether the trade-offs are worth the savings.I appreciate the concept of Temu and believe it has the potential to provide great value to customers. By addressing some of the issues related to product quality and shipping times and ensuring more accurate product descriptions, Temu could become an even more attractive platform for budget-conscious shoppers like myself.",2,02/12/2023
Ordered 5 items! Wish I had not. Took ages. Received ?€?delivered?€?. NOT TO MY ADDRESS!! No idea where package is. Customer service bot 10000% useless,1,02/12/2023
"WARNING!!  I paid $12 for expedited shipping on 2 separate orders.  They shipped to wrong address (260 instead of 261).  I got a notification, from an unknown source, stating my shipments were being returned unless I pay an add?€?l $3.  I went to Temu acct to check my address..it was correct 261.  I requested a refund on both items bc it was their mistake, but I was only refunded for the products, not the $24 of expedited shipping.  Bottom line, they got their items back and made $24 on the order.  NEVER AGAIN!Edited post?€?I never paid the extra $3 per item to stop return, so I requested those refunds, however, I kept getting delivery notifications to 260.  I went to 260 and told them they may be getting packages for me afterall.  They did and gave them to me.  Whomever threatened me with returning my products or else pay more money was a scammer. I did receive my products.",1,02/12/2023
"My wife has order 20 plus times from Temu. Have always received her items. Some of there items are not up to par but for the price, you can?€?t beat it.",4,02/12/2023
"I have ordered several items from Temu and mostly they were excellent.  One item (glass beads) showed a very misleading photo and I didn't check the size, hence they were far smaller than expected, and another item (crystal bracelet) was of a very different colour to the photo, but the other items (bracelet, silver ring, amber necklace) were better than expected - all very good quality and so cheap! Also their promise to refund ??5 to your Temu account if item arrives late was followed through immediately (one item arrived one day late).",4,02/12/2023
"Absolutely love Temu, Amazing products, great quality & at these prices you just can't not buy again & again.Great customer service too - very helpful - Just can't fault this company. Thank you Temu.",5,02/12/2023
Gonna close my account there is always something latest being 2 broken eye pencils the person said I?€?ll see what I can do an never came back so iv just binned them another bad experience I even sent pictures of the broken pencils for myself an my opinion not a good company,1,02/12/2023
"I bought a ski outfit that says clear: 2pcs (Jacket and Pants). I ve just received the jacket. Once I contacted the customer service their analysis is based on opinion and they just replied with a long answer that they sent correct, when they didn?€?t. Why on Earth I would create a stressful situation before my trip. A friend sugges me this TEMU, but until the moment was the worst company that I bought online and their customer service is completely useless. I felt they just lied to me. So unfair!!!",1,02/12/2023
"I placed an order for 2 wigs for Halloween. 3 weeks later have not been sent, I Called and they said the plane broke down OMG worst excuse I have ever heard. still has not been sent to me.

They told me it was shipped but they needed another plane..OMG I demanded a refund. The Plain broke down. I still can't stop laughing. Do not trust these people",1,02/12/2023
Temu. Are great bought loads off temu..shoes boots sandals leather jackets which were under 10 pounds .you have price adjustment if price goes down flash deals.5 credit if orders late sort and problem out often you told to keep product if your not happy.and they refund on top. Or keep product and they send replacement for free. What other firm does that.stuff is cheap just bought gabby.house plushies.cats for 2.50.each.same as real ones selling for 15 pound.so I think it's a great website and free for on 5 pound orders they also give 6 p just for.tapping on promotions.so knock before you try it. It's great my sandals are like Dr martins.with tag.on back under 5 pounds. Identical so I love it.don't shop.anywhere else now.well done temu.,5,02/12/2023

I love this company but the one complaint that I have is every time I order something it literally takes a month for me to get it. This is too long and then sometimes my stuff is damaged. But my biggest complaint is the long wait that you have to go through. You guys have got to do better on this.,4,03/12/2023
Overall would recommend.Cheapest stuff on the market most of the time and same quality as the expensive stuff on other websites.Even returned an expresso machine with no problems.Only issues. Make is easier to get offers.Make sure reviews are up to date and true.,4,03/12/2023
My order went missing and it's not possible to get through to someone to request a refund! Evri lost my parcel but that's Temu's responsibility to give my money back. Useless nonsense!!!!!,1,03/12/2023

I explained I don't expect to order something that requires an outdated sim & that you should not be selling it.Decided to write & give rating that company deserves.Order ID: PO-096-11094290596472465.

i have had orders not delivered and no refund items missing parts and returned but yet again no refund i asks for a contact email or contact details to escalate the issues to be told there wasn?€?t any,1,03/12/2023
"I received a refund on the items that I ordered because there was a mistake on the delivery. Eventually I received the delivery. But then after three months, I realised they credited the amount to my temu account when I wanted to make another purchase i realised there was some money. Anyway, I didn't read properly, contacted the service centre and said I think there's a money credited into my account by mistake. So the customer service gave me a link to return the refund. So I did as asked. I only then got to know after I read their policy  because it was faulty at their end, if I  received the items eventually,  I can keep the item ( plus the money) because it's their policy,!!! How annoying that the customer service didn't even bother to tell me their policy and it was supposed to be my choice to return the money, because in their policy I shouldn't have! So ??40 they took back! I wanted to return the item as I was so unhappy but they said since it's passed 90days I can't return it! It was my only third time using this ,I'm used to shein, which has been always honest. If I had any problem with my item, or they made a mistake,  they wouldn't ask me to return it. I gave temu a go, because I saw my neighbour bought item from here. I'm still waiting for my another purchase to arrive, after that,  I will not ever used this app again! They have offended me so much!",1,03/12/2023

"So far I have had 5 orders, each with multiple items (5 to 7 items). Every item without exception is exactly what I was shown on the images or video, also the quality is higher than expected. Yes the company is linked to China! So what? If another country sold the same things at the same prices, I would buy from them. If I ever get a duff product, I will update my review.",5,03/12/2023
Just had an email from temu as today is the last day for delivery before they have to refund me ??5 and conveniently Evri tried to deliver but I wasn't in. Really I've been here all day and have CCTV that shows evri has not attempted the delivery. Temu is clearly paying Evri to lie to stop them having to pay out. What an awful company will never be using again!!!!!,1,04/12/2023
"Returned a double order. which they told me to do, and they refused to refund one of them stating they never got it.  It was packed together as they said to do.  They gave me every excuse not to refund the item.  Now the item.  I purchased an outdoor rug.  I was shocked when I got it as it was a mere piece of plastic with a rip. I sent a pic before I returned it but alas they claim it was not received yet the other order which was with it was received??? I had to return most of the tee shirts I ordered as as they were cheaply made garbage.  There was one set I kept as they were ok.    I was bombarded with emails and text messages to the point I had to block them, and uninstall the app. I did get my money back through my bank so all is good now. Not much to add, I spoke to many reps at Temu and got nowhere.  They kept saying they didn't get it over and over so I gave up and explained to my bank what happened.  The only thing is I don't have exact dates. I will.never shop with them again.",2,04/12/2023

I have no complaints about Temu.  Ordered many things and delivery has been fine.  Ordered an item which wasn?€?t suitable in the end so contacted them and they credited me immediately and said I didn?€?t need to return the item.  I don?€?t use the app just the website and unsubscribed from emails so not bombarded with deals.  Overall really happy and have just ordered again.,5,04/12/2023
"I just bought a mat from Temu and when it arrived at the Portuguese postal service I was advised that I would have to pay from 7.59???. Needless to say, I was not pleased! However, the mat has just arrived and I didn?€?t have to pay anything! Whether this was because I complained to Temu, who were very nice about it, or not, I don?€?t know. The mat is rather lightweight for a doormat but otherwise as stated. I would buy from them again but I?€?m worried about identity theft and hacking which seems to be prevalent. I do wonder how Temu manage such low prices if shipping is free!",4,04/12/2023
I purchased three jewelry items. Great variety of products. The quality is directly related to the price. It arrived during the promised time period. Overall I am happy with my purchase.,5,04/12/2023

Temu is a complete scam.  I ordered goods and they delivered the wrong item deliberately.   Asking me to accept a partial refund and give the wrong goods to friends and family.  Now I keep getting emails saying a hacker has got the refund.  Temu is a complete scam.  Still waiting for the refund.  No one from the company has contacted since their standard response.  Wow Email attached DO NOT USE.  SCAM.  SCAM,1,04/12/2023
"I am thrilled with Temu, I had a return to be issued to my credit card, that card was cancelled, can I have credit on account instead since didn't receive refund!  Also, since I began ordering, I have had fraud on me credit card!! I don't have any other credit cards, and use my card to order only from Temu, are you sharing my credit card?",5,04/12/2023
"I have ordered from them several times and even got some friends and family to order from TEMU and no one has complained I only hope that TEMU sets up a wishlist like WISH does as its really nice to keep lists for my family and friends for birthdays and xmas times  When it comes to clothes , shoes and things to wear be careful because the sizes  have a tendency to be smaller  plus when they say that 3 pc bedding is for sale its actually 2 pillowcases and one fitted sheet but NO flat sheetthis is just a few things but over all I really like TEMU and you can save so much money cause the shipping is freeBasically read well everything concerning a product that your interested in and read all the reviews about it",4,04/12/2023
"I have used them so many times and had zero issues with delivery. Ok it takes 10 days, but if you're not desperate?Admittedly a couple of items have been poor quality - for the money not worth kicking up a fuss - but over all the items have been great, and have actually exceeded my expectations (CCTV camera was that good, I bought another 3 for family - actually better than the commercial one I previously bought and at a fraction of the cost) Was very sceptical at first, but so glad I took a punt on them.",5,04/12/2023
Temu have been in touch today to say that my parcel is lost. However they have given me a full refund which was applied automatically as well as a voucher. I have reordered the items but I must say I am impressed with their customer service,5,04/12/2023

"I Paid over $61 for 11 items for my apt. Received 4, in a 5x5x5cm bag weighing <1 lbs. I provided pics of the bag and a copy of the email from the delivery company confirming sz & weight of what they delivered. Temu 5xs denied my refund request saying all items were packaged in 1 bag confirmed by the warehouse, when in truth it would be impossible for all 11 to fit the bag I received. Most likely my order was packaged in 2 bags and someone put another customers label on My bag, then when time to ship they annotated I only had 1 bag. Common sense does not seem to be a job requirement working for them. I hv referred many ppl to them prior bcuz I had no issues even though my daughter has received someone else?€?s order instead of her own before. Until this order I?€?ve had no issues but basically they stole $34 from me & I?€?m goin to make sure everyone knows it! I?€?m a mom, grandmom & a vet, not a liar or a thief yet that?€?s how they treated me. My integrity is impeccable. However for $34 I will make sure everyone is aware ahead of time when ordering from this company.UPDATE: This reply does NOT reflect the reply I received in my email. They once again stated after reviewing the warehouse video, all items were indeed placed in 1 bag, a lie! I checked my UPS App this morning to get delivery details on another package coming tomorrow and discovered a 4 lb package coming from TEMU, labeled on the 19th, my order was placed on the 18th. I wish I could upload images here. I did a live chat with UPS who stated they never received the package from the Shipper, hv them check the warehouse. I now hv proof my order WAS INDEED IN 2 boxes and I only received 1. Will delete this app once I?€?m refunded. Don?€?t risk it, not worth the headache! Now they?€?re asking for the order number to accompany the tracking number from UPS I provided to them clearly showing they prepared the label for me on the 19th. Because they refuse to admit it?€?s from the order I placed on the 18th but only received 4 items nor do they want to admit they lied about placing my 11 piece order in 1 bag. This site should provide the means to include pictures as proof, I hv loads of it!",1,04/12/2023
"Did what they claimed, and supplied the goods ordered without fuss, but items were not of very good quality, but you get what you pay for, so despite the kind offer to return goods, I don't think this is necessary as Temu have upheld their end of the agreement of purchasing goods.  My order was split into 2 dispatches which ment 1 box was delayed by a couple of day. Even with the 50% discount, the prices were about the same as can be found on amazon (of which those items will be with you next day or day after), but the delay in shipping from China means, in my opinion, their not competitive, which is not their fault.  The old saying is, ""does what it says on the tin"", I can't say any fairer than that, but I don't think I'll be returning, as I have cheaper and quicker supply chains available to me that offer better quality products. This is personal preference and not at all any kind of remark on this company, as I cant complain about the service or communication which was both good. Sorry this review is so middle of the road, but my experience was neither positive or negative.The customer service team is very active and I am sure would handle any issues with great satisfaction.",4,04/12/2023
"Temu do not attempt to mislead people but allow them to do so themselves. I was suckered in by an offer of something I could use at a ridiculously low price. However, I found out that there was a minimum order of  ??10 so I filled up my trolley accordingly. I received the goods (as described, no complaints there). Then the fun started. An email or push notification every 20 minutes. These people really are the marketing equivalent of the Scientologists. I have now worked out how to make them go away but it took too long. Never again!",3,04/12/2023
"Gave Temu a trial run with some small purchases totalling ???20. ??? Delivery took about one week. ??? Items shipped in a bag, with no packing protection. ??? Bag was torn open and items were visible. ??? 3 items in the bag were damaged. ??? Very poor quality and not as described. I didn't have high hopes for Temu, I wasn't at all surprised that the items were poor quality and damaged. They didn't have any kind of foam packing. the bag was torn open in two places, so clearly someone had a peek inside to see if there was anything worth taking. I gave them a shot  but I won't be using Temu again. I would definitely not recommended it.I would also like to point out that temu went to great lengths to remove this review (stating that i didn't purchase anything and that it was a fake review) so I had to send confirmation of my purchases and photos of the damaged goods to trustpilot to get them to leave my review up and mark it as verified. Temu are a shady shady company",1,04/12/2023
"If my experiemce is anything to go by I feel that Temu is possibly unfairly blamed when the responsibility lies somewhere else in the delivery chain... in my case my parcel was received by Evri (formerly known as Hermes with a reputation I'm sure we're all familiar with!) on the 13 Sep - 3 days after ordering and it then sat somewhere in its depot for  the following 12 days when it was finally delivered... in the meantime Temu had apologised & kept me updated, refunded my money in full & given me a ??5 late delivery voucher to boot... absolutely stellar customer service, in my view, and as I stated to them. it's a pity they have partnered with a delivery company with possibly the worst reputation in the country - so bad in fact, it had to change its name!",5,05/12/2023
"Ok so... my packages finally arrived and were what I had paid for. Some items quality was questionable but was also expected as it was cheap but some were not half bad too so pretty good to shop. Bad thing is they arrived late however, Temu did put a $5 credit on my Temu account for the late delivery. The delivery service they use though is still not recommended. Fast Horse Express was not a good service. My first package was literally tossed over the fence and into my yard (which was captured on security cam). However my 2nd package which arrived late was placed on the front door step and they took a snap shot of it and posted it on the Fast Horse Express tracker which was nice. So I do hope that all delivery drivers from Fast Horse Express will be doing that from now on if they're going to fix up their services. Because it really does need a good fix up. Would I recommend to shop on Temu? Yes for now as long as you don't run into major problems. I've still heard many more other horror stories of items being lost or refunds not paid etc but you know what. They are cheap and the items are pretty good.",3,05/12/2023
"I have been surprised with the way orders are packaged for shipping.  All items are bunched together and then wrapped in Temu plastic envelope and taped with NO protection for the contents (especially when glass items are contained).  The products I ordered were of moderate quality and definitely misrepresented by photos and questionable descriptions, if any.  Furthermore, products generally do not have any included instructions.",3,05/12/2023
"I ordered several items from Temu. Some were excellent for the price, some were not. They were damaged or not a advertised.  I posted photos and made honest comments on the reviews. Within a very short space of time Temu responded and refunded the money for the unsatisfactory/ damaged products.",4,05/12/2023
TEMU is the future of online shopping. Incredible range and prices of all items Their products are very well made and incorporate amazing technology Delivery is very fast (Aust Post) Well done,5,05/12/2023
Just bought shoes from Temu.  Will probably wear them as slippers.  Very poor quality.  Toe of left shoe not even stitched fully.  Will not buy again.,2,05/12/2023
"Shipping takes absolutely ages, which would be fine had they been honest about it from the start. They gave me an expected delivery date of 25th, by the time i checked on 25th it said between 25/9 to 5/10Wont be using temu again its crap",1,05/12/2023
Very happy customer! I ordered many products and they are all delivered on time. Only had 1 wrong product which they gave a full refund. Totally recommend Temu,5,05/12/2023
They keep trying to take my review down. Awful company,1,05/12/2023
"Order never arrived, was never delivered. Allegedly held up in customs. That Is a big fat lie, because that would have been already 5 days ago. Custom does not have the parcel, nor has it ever pulled it for inspection. Timo has no on line contact info for non delivered parcels, but only refunds $5 on late delivery. Well, we had no delivery. Not received the merchandise bought, paid and advised to be delivered. No, none, delivery took place. Received several emails with advisor of gift parcel has been send. None ever arrived.same as paid for oder never arrived, but claimed to have been shipped with tracking number provided. Checking with tracking number brings up message ?€? retained for checking by customs?€?. $28 order with 8 items of daily use household / kitchen gadgets.This company and its affiliate / shipper are at best  unreliable or incompetent and should not be considered a professional business. After placing the review, Temo refunded the full purchase price of the non delivered order after great efforts to find contact to communicate with their on line chat agent.",1,05/12/2023
"I have reviewed this company before, PLEASE AVOID IT IS UNTRUSTWORTHY. I placed an order, thankfully with PayPal, the price they quoted me was not the price I was charged. PayPal got me a refund for the disputed amount and the balance was for the price quoted. They are refusing to honour the order and have my money, PayPal have been engaged again. I placed two orders and the first one came, the quality is cheap CRAP, had I known I would not have placed the second order but they crossed over. AVOID AT ALL COST, the customer service is geared up to avoid helping you, it is there to defend them, they will try everything to avoid settling your dispute.",1,05/12/2023
"I recently was browsing through some sites checking out sneaker boots and casual boots. Now everytime I see something that may interest me and it's Temu a spin the wheel claim your prize b.s. pops up. I just want to look around compare style and price. We all know when something pops up on internet there's an""x"" to exit or cancel. So I said again why do I have to play spin the wheel just to look at something?",3,05/12/2023
Really good job first time I ever use them,5,05/12/2023
"First time ordering, wasn?€?t sure if I should use them as I?€?ve only recently come across them. But I would definitely recommend. Arrived within a week and had lots of discounts and money off my order. This is a genuine buyer. From my experience I would recommend despite the bad reviews!",5,05/12/2023
"I have ordered multiple times from Temu. Clothes,shoes,kitchen items and more. I have been pleased with what I have received.  I do wish there were more cotton items that were not expensive.",5,05/12/2023
"BRILLIANT! I brought loads of my wedding things off here, all my flowers and had so many compliments on the day. I?€?ve brought loads of presents and gifts, I?€?ve won on the free game.

TEMU made my wedding amazing  and saves me loads, I?€?ve got loads of people yo join since and they have had massive savings on their first shop Thanks TEMUKeep up the great work Venusvaughan",5,05/12/2023

Absolutely awful I had 1 Oder delivered the following 2 orders nothing and they keep saying we will give you credit to use. What use is credit when they can't forfill orders. They try to tell you that the airlines are on strike UTTER RUBBISH!!!! This is a scam company do not order,1,05/12/2023
"Absolutely love this site. Have never had any issues and item always arrive on time. Clothes are great quality and fit perfect, if anything, kids clothes come a little bigger. Would def recommend this site, as it is definately NOT a scam. I know plenty of people that are extremely happy with their purchases. Prices are great too. Have also ordered random things and all work perfectly and are good. A*****",5,05/12/2023
"I was skeptical as I'd not heard of this company and they were advertising through social media sites but i have to say, they were first rate! Order delivered on time with regular updates as to the progress of dispatch and transit. Items are as described. Great communication throughout and great value for money.",5,05/12/2023
"Closed my account in the middle of an order, I really don't want cheap sub standard goods from China and/or other countries. There should be a way to check what the sellers country of origin is, I wouldn't of signed up in the first place.",1,05/12/2023
"I have bought a few clothes from Temu that I thought were really good. I enjoyed them, they were properly put together, and the cotton fabric was nice. However, their sizes are confusing. I generally wear a size medium to large (12-14), but they said a size 14 was extra extra large, so I ordered a dress in an XXL. It came and was more like a size 20! Very disappointing!! I tried to talk to someone about it and they asked if I wanted a resend. I said yes, with a size medium. Apparently that was the wrong thing to say because then they said a re-sand would be exactly the same as what I already had. So I asked them please not to do a resend, but they said they had already put it in, so I was going to get a resend, like it or not, with the same size. No matter what I said or how I tried to explain the problem that was all they could offer me. They said I could try to send it back and then order it again in a different size. There didn?€?t seem to be any way for me to explain the problem, and to make them not send another XX large. Unfortunately I have received the second XX large at this point and I am attempting to return to sender. I have wasted money on something that I do not want and I?€?m not sure I will ever order anything from Temu again since their customer service is impossible to deal with.",1,05/12/2023
The stuff I bought was fine. Some of it was cheap and crudely made but that's what I expected.Three days after using the app I had my Facebook and Instagram account hacked. Iv never been hacked before so it's too much of a coincidence considering other similar reviews iv seen. Luckily I used PayPal and my banking was safe.,1,05/12/2023
Waiting on mu order but everything has been great so far,5,05/12/2023
"these guys are the best so far i ever came across, lets be real you can?€?t expect a top notch quality for a few cent you pay for an item and free dellivery on top !! but lets be honest quality is far away not bad, keep up business, keep up using GLS and i will be def ordering again",5,06/12/2023
"I visited the Temu site to look at a cross body bag. Found one I liked but out of stock. That was at the beginning of August, since then I have been bombarded day and night with messages demanding that I purchase something from their site. I have requested that they cease sending these threatening messages but to not avail. Disgraceful behaviour.  Obviously a con company. What waste of time this dreadful company are still sending pressure emails telling me to buy some of their tat.",1,06/12/2023
"I received a parcel of items which were, for the best part substandard. I have never seen such a poor quality sweater and the colour which should have been a soft gold was brighter than a duster. The""white"" top was not white .The garden tool had no handle and the doorbell is not suitable for most UK broadband- I should have checked this though. Only a pair of mens shoes were even remotely OK.",1,06/12/2023
"To be honest, I find that this application simply sells rubbish, the same as other sites like Wish or Joom. I ordered some socks and a sweatshirt, no cotton but 100% polyester...who is crazy enough to wear a garment entirely derived from petroleum?!The prices are not that low if you think that the products you will receive are of very low quality...in fact I have seen products that you can find for little money in household stores being sold at very high prices on Temu. just because they repeat the stupid phrase that ""you spend like a billionaire"" people should have more brains and understand that it's all lies. furthermore, these products have a large impact on the environment and increase pollution.",1,06/12/2023
Avoid avoid avoid Just had a delivery left on my step by a vet ride Asian man who thought it was ok to talk on his phone dump my parcel on the front door didnt say a word to me but thought it was OK to take a photo of me in the upstairs window without my consent...Temu I would like a response this is illegal your courier had no right to do whst he dishes my daughter wakes up I will get the order number and the photo I have sent you the order number I don't know how to send the photo Temu I am taking legal advice this is against the law its supposed to be a picture of my door number not of me I am chronically ill I don't look well seriously how dare u .I think you need to contact me if u want to keep this out of court.. Update i contacted Temu asking them why their courier took.my photo they will take no responsibility at all so basically they have my name my address my bank details..And a photo of me.My reply to Temu you are just trying to cover yourselves i spoke to you yesterday you would not accept any responsibility I stick to my review,1,06/12/2023
Don't bother ... customer service is diabolical..The problem is getting refund..I returned my items using their courier and their labels..they are claiming goods not received eventho  tracking says delivered. ... they can't find them... so they are refusing to refund me .. I have sent so many emails and they don't seem to understand the concept that if they or their courier have lost item its not my fault..tracking is proof that I returned items as per their procedures..why should I be held liable and loose money.....Update for....Temu Customer Service ..you've replied to this complaint via another forum asking for details which I have sent yet again (about 10+ times so far) only response I get is you will look into it then nothing done until I post another negative review...but here is order again - PO-210-04255373333073834Would you like copy of email confirming that you will refund ?UPDATE..Temu why contact Trust Pilot for order number when I've already added to initial review?,1,06/12/2023
"Heard a lot of bad press so was reluctant to buy as their products were so cheap though it might be a scam, but spent the minimum to give it a go was pleasantly surprised to get my order in time and we'll packaged and decent quality. Have had 3 more orders since and glad to say all were great bargains. I am addicted well done Temu",5,06/12/2023
"Visited the website with no expectations, the great prices and range of items really surprised me. Free delivery for orders over 10 and so many good deals. Quality is obviously not going to be like the OG brand if you're looking to buy a watch, or a phone, but that's not why you visit Temu anyway. Their bread and butter is all the small gimmicks which you may need around the house, gadgets and appliances, even gifts and decorations. Only downside is the 80%, 90% discount promotions ads you get in the app which clearly equal to the same price as before. Still cheap but worth keeping in mind. Delivery always arrived and you can see the tracked order down to every move, when it's in flight or passing customs. Chat team always there.",4,06/12/2023
"My second review for Temu. 1st  order no problems. This time ordered some bits and pieces mainly DIY bits. Made and placed order then realised i needed some other bits so placed another the following day. Items arrived about 4 days later delivered by Evri. Great no problems and items just what i wanted. All i would say is check the size of the item, in the picture it looks the perfect size but a lot of times the item is a lot smaller than the picture looks. I will use again great prices.",5,06/12/2023
Love Temu I ordered a lot from them never disappointed looking for a present for grandchildren decided to go with a well named brand omg never again the box was damaged it looks like I got it from a car boot sale Temu are brilliant,5,06/12/2023
Many items arrived damaged.  Ordered 10  pcs got 5 pcs broken items...How ridiculous Temu ask me to return a broken pieces of ceramic pot! Improve how to pack and repack items! R.I.P,1,06/12/2023

Didn?€?t got my refund back !! Didn?€?t received my items this whole company is a scam!!???????? I?€?m pissed,1,06/12/2023
"False reviews on their website ? Well it's China, what do you people excpect, the truth ? Come on...Anyway, I bought there twice. And for 50 bucks it's insane the amount of things you have. Sure, they don't look like products that will last 20 years and that you'll bequeath to your grandchildren. But it doesn't matter, everything I bought is so damn useful.I fear they'll slowly raise their prices to fit the GDP of rich countries buying from them. But as it is, I'd say run and buy stuff there. I received for about 120 bucks of objects so far. Bought twice, delivery went fine and nothing was missing.",4,06/12/2023
"Temu has become my favorite app to shop from, not over priced, free shipping and handling and you can get free stuff playing game and inviting friends.",5,06/12/2023
I would never buy the surprise box's because most of the items was for Men and I didn't find anything I would want to use.,4,07/12/2023
"Thought I'd give it a try so downloaded the app. Bought some items with free delivery and have to wait over a week. haven't received yet, but this isn't my complaint.. My problem is that I'm constantly being bombarded with messages off offers and gifts, it's like I've got a fruit machine on my phone.. I don't much like fruit machines.update...thanks for the generic reply I'm still waiting for my items.Update..Items have finally arrived and because they where late temu have me ??5 credit, which I wont be using.The product ""mens underwear"" are up there with the worst purchases in my life, the quality is super low, the materials used are such low quality I'm not even going to try them on. worst purchase ever.I'm deleting the app",1,07/12/2023
"I've order a few times and have been happy with my stuff , but unfortunately  I've order from a fb app called temu UK witch advertised  the same goods ( I now believe  this is a fake  site )  they say you get a box of goods  for ??3 I've had a txt convent  saying the box has been damaged  and the address  has come off I click the link and yes its not available  ,  I really  feel that compies should try and protect they products and try reporting fake sites stealing there name , bands ect",5,07/12/2023
I have ordered many of times and never had a problem yea sometimes things are cheap and tacky but that is reflected in the price.I got some brilliant inflatables for my holiday and the amount of people that commented on them.I would definitely recommend them.,5,07/12/2023
"I was a little worried about using this website but decided to give it a go?€?and I LOVE it! They sell everything under the sun, delivery is fairly quick and they are ultra-efficient at dealing with returns. As you would expect from the prices, not everything is of the highest quality?€?hey, you?€?re not gonna get a diamond ring which has cost you less than ??2 or a pair of Nike trainers for a fiver, but if you?€?re fine with cheap & cheerful it is definitely worth having a look, and I certainly haven?€?t received anything which is actually shoddy! Just be aware that the prices change often, so have a quick look over your ?€?cart?€? just as you are submitting your order, to ensure nothing has jumped up in price! All in all a great website which I?€?ve had absolutely no problems with and would definitely recommend. ????",5,07/12/2023

"Very cheap items within an hour you have installed the app. Later that hour, the items are normal in chinese stuff prices, maybe higher than other companies. Okay so far. But, they accept only credit cards and PayPal as payments and not prepaid cards, where you can control your money better. I will never try again to order from there.",1,07/12/2023
Was sceptical at first so put in a small order it arrived . So have used them now about 6 months and never a problem.,5,07/12/2023
"I have ordered from Temu 3 times now. Once a month for the last 3 months. I was a little nervous about it because I've heard a lot of bad things about them. However  I'm glad I ignored these reviews and ordered anyway, and it has turned out to be a fantastic company to deal with. I ordered dollhouse accessories. They have a huge selection, many of which I have felt useful. It's fun to browse through these types of products and have found a lot of things that I could use. Ordering is simple. When I found things I liked I saved them to my cart. Ordering when I was ready was very simple. They estimated when they would get here and they were right every time. They offered a $5 credit if they were late, which is a very nice thing, but I never got to receive it because they were always on time. The prices were really great! The shipping was free, which is an excellent thing to get! I had a problem only once: they forgot one of the items. Dealing with customer service was great and efficient.  They gave me the option of having the refund put back on my card or getting a store credit. I chose the latter, and the credit was put on my account within a couple minutes. When I ordered again, the credit was automatically applied to my order, without my having to do anything. The products were very high quality and extremely cute! The things that people seem to be having the most problems with are clothes; I did not order any so I am not able to say anything about them. But what I did order was wonderful! The size was realistic and of the correct proportion. They were very well made, of very good quality. They were just as expected; the photos and descriptions were very accurate.  The shipping was very fast. I am so glad I found this company! I have continued to order from them and I would encourage others to buy from them!",5,07/12/2023
"Just recieved my 3rd order, my daughter has recieved her 2nd. So far everything is pretty well spot on. I recieved a blouse, that I just didn't really like much, and recieved an immediate refund. Twice my package has been a day late, not their fault, but the carriers, each time I have recieved a ??5 credit. Much of the clothing is polyester, in various guises, but I am very pleased. The christmas tree ornaments I have recieved are amazing. Can't fault them. Customer service is 2nd to none.",5,07/12/2023
Absolute rubbish! Terrible quality clothing. I returned all 3 items in one parcel and was refunded for 2... apparently one was missing which is impossible as they were all in the same bag! Never ever again,1,07/12/2023
"I have done approximately 6 orders with Temu since Aug 2023 and have not had a single problem with them.  Minor ones, were readily resolved. Their deliveries are quick, timely and efficient. I have returned items from each and every order and kept some others. Their returns process is very easy, and efficient. Also, their refunds are also quick and efficient. I?€?ve only had 2 product glitches. One was a ceramic coffee cup lid which arrived broken. This was only because it wasn?€?t appropriately packaged. I got a refund on that. And, there was a 3 tier plastic and metal narrow trolley with castor wheels that really was very poorly manufactured and fell apart at the slightest touch. Temu relayed apologies and immediately refunded the item without any need to return it. So, I donated that to a charity. A heads up for western women in regards to any clothing on Temu. Their sizing are quite small. For examplt, bought a really lovely, surprisingly good quality, casual linen pants for AU$11. They were a size 18. Now, I would be anywhere between a plus size 16-18 or regular size 20-22 in pants (Australian Sizings) and was curious to see if their size 18 would fit. Unfortunately, they didn?€?t and really needed to be another size or 2 up. I got a refund on these. Their bra sizes are in no way suitable for large busted or plus size women. I tried one style in a size 3XL and it was more like a size 12-14. Again, readily got a refund on this. So, in my experience with Temu it?€?s only been wonderfully positive and very efficient. I have used Ali Express in the past but, they are truly a nightmare to deal with and to get anything refunded. As the customer, they force you to deal directly with the seller to get a refund and the sellers are all hardcore Chinese retailers who will give nothing. Also, all the goods come directly from each individual seller in China and it takes months to get anything. Simply not worth it. I would never ever use them again. What Ali express does so badly, Temu does superbly right. Good job Temu???????????????? Keep it up.????",5,07/12/2023
"I started shopping with Temu before reading the reviews. Then I placed some huge orders, again before reading the reviews. Once I researched further and came across Trust Pilot I became very apprehensive about the negative reviews. I would not have placed my orders out of caution although I?€?ve not had any issues before. Nevertheless, I?€?m so happy to say all my orders came thought and Temu has offered excellent customer service with returns. Their offers and prices are amazing too! Not all what you read is a true reflection.  Our household has now used Temu multiple times and thank God we?€?ve had no issues at all to date. Therefore I would recommend Temu without reservation.",5,07/12/2023
"A scam company run by the Chinese government.Temu is a scam and here?€?s how it works, first scammers use the hacked profiles they have stolen from Fakebook to spread fake ads for Temu in groups or to random peoples pages. Then when people sign up they are promised money in exchange for spreading more of Temu spam. The app has hidden spyware that steals your passwords etc as well as that it also relays information directly to the Chinese government.If it?€?s from China it?€?s a scam, if it?€?s on Fakebook it?€?s a scam!Edit: so the scammers at Temu want me to provide them with details of my experience well F U you Temu I don?€?t have to answer to some Chinese scam site so no I?€?m not telling you anything and if Trust pilot want to try and force me to do this then I will see you in court because I won?€?t be told what I can and can?€?t do by some crappy website.Clearly trust pilot are taking bribes from Temu to remove negative reviews about them but sorry I won?€?t be taking my review down and as I said if you remove it I will take you to court and force you to restore my review as well as pay me compensation.You won?€?t be bullying me trust pilot.Maybe you should concentrate more on not allowing fake reviews that are just copy n pasted like the top 3 reviews on Temu, literally the exact same review from 3 different people.

"I'm positively surprised with the quality of products from Temu. I started buying for small orders nad eventually few bigger ones and till now all items have been good! The only off point would be the delivery times, could take much longer and the service provider in Belgium is Colis prive, which necessarily doesn't have any backup options in case you are not available.",4,07/12/2023
"With products and delivery I can?€?t fault it, I?€?ve had a few junk gadgets but only just started to plunge into more expensive items and clothing and so far so good. You do need to order 1x size over due to size comparison with China. Now for the disappointment: I put off passing my mobile number on to Temu, I don?€?t trust Chinese and Indians with my number, but after 1yr I gave my number last week to track shipping, and yes, today I received a Fake Evri sms saying attempted delivery and to click on link, but I expected it and chatted to live chat on Temu and they know, believe me they know this text scam has everything to do with them, it?€?s how they work?€??€?DO NOT TRUST TEMU WITH CELL NUMBERS AND DO NOT CLICK ON LINKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY DODGY TEXTS",4,07/12/2023
"I've purchased several items from Temu at different times, and have always received what I bought.  The quality has been fair to good.  I have not downloaded the app, it's not necessary to buy there.  Temu accepts PayPal, so I've felt safe sending payment that way.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they send way too many emails regarding deals or shipping status.  Also I cannot find a way to contact them directly.",4,07/12/2023
"At the end of the day, everything boils down to ?€?price?€?. Obviously, with online shopping sites, there is a bit of risk because you cannot review the product first-hand. It?€?s a hit & miss. One thing is for certain, TEMU offers a huge selection of products for you to check out. If you change your mind, they?€?ll refund you in full hassle-free and you have 90 days to make up your mind. Their site is also conveniently set up to help you print/save your shipping label ?€?free of charge?€?. You don?€?t have to call Customer Service, you don?€?t have to go to a link, you don?€?t have to go to your email.

There may be a slight language barrier but let?€?s face it, majority of these global online shopping sites have similar challenges. I just roll with it. I explore, I dabble, if I find the online site is not a perfect fit for me, I return everything and move on. Companies worldwide are making decisions every day based on how they want to manage their business and they judge by sales. If they really suck that bad, eventually they will go out of business. Still, as a customer, I appreciate everyone that uses their voice. With all the online competition, it does get their attention. Regardless if feedback is positive or negative, at least they are learning what they?€?re doing right and where they need to improve.",5,07/12/2023
I had a delivery issue occur and went to customer service. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and effectively my issue was addressed. The representative was very helpful and kind. I have loved using Temu because it is high quality items for a low price.,5,07/12/2023
They had me waiting 17 days just to say sorry we cant do anything about your parcel.....,1,07/12/2023
"Avoid this company like the plague. They entice you in with deals galore then they have you!! Yes there are some amazing items at ridiculously low prices but sometimes it is tat! You will get constant emails and texts with deals like ""exclusively for you, 80% off your order"" the price is already taken off so the price you see is what you pay....80% IS NOT TAKEN OFF AT END!! I personally have just been pulled in and I feel like an idiot. I had a notification stating that if I spend ??15 I would get a variety of money off vouchers for FUTURE spends totalling ??264. I bought something I did not actually need to take advantage and I did indeed get the vouchers. I HAD 24 HOURS TO USE THEM! To take full advantage of them within the 24 hours I would have to spend ??1120.00! On split orders. If I had that money I WOULD NOT BE USING TEMU. I do have 3 deliveries enroute and as soon as recieved I will be unsubscribing. Be aware!Following on from above, the pictures you see are doctored! This is most fraudulent and misleading. For example, I ordered sone double sided tape with an image showing the tape about 6-7 inches in diameter on someones hand. I recieved a roll about 1 1/2 inches....I have reported many items that are inaccuratively described or images that are misleading and nothing done. Why have the option to report?Following on from the reply from Temu, you will notice they did not address the ??264 of vouchers issue. It is such a pity that I can not put photos (screenshots) up on this site.. basically there is no talking their way out of it!!",1,08/12/2023
I'm writing this review as after reading other reviews on your website I felt it only fair to add my genuine experience with Temu.Yesterday I joined Temu and placed a couple of orders for ??33 and later in the day... I decided to cancel my orders and they organised my refund with a notice informing me it could take 5-14 days or in some cases 30 days for funds to enter my bank account..... I was preparing for a long wait for my money.....today whilst making a payment from my account.....my refund had been received.... and not only that but my payment to Temu was still in pending.My honest experience with Temu.,5,08/12/2023
I can't recommend Temu enough...Simple as that...,5,08/12/2023
"The order was stuck at the airport with no movement and was advised to wait 15 days, don't think so.  Kept asking the same questions, full of meaningless platitudes that are not genuine.  I am stuck with no order, no refund and no idea what is happening with this order, I would avoid this company like the plague.  I will be in contact with Trading Standards if refund not received within 7 working days",1,08/12/2023
I was very impressed by the tracking service. I ordered the product 7 days ago. It was collected from the Airport last night by GLS and was delivered this morning.,5,08/12/2023
"Great value, never had any issues with contact and refunding easy and free",4,08/12/2023
Love this site have had loads of stuff on here everything was perfect also if your parcel arrives late you get five pounds credit great service fast delivery will keep on shopping with temu.,5,08/12/2023
"I?€?ve bought over 2 hundred pounds worth of stuff probably more to be honest and I?€?ve only had a couple of things that wasn?€?t the correct size but can still wear, thankfully I?€?m not dumb enough to buy electronics etc cause you know if you have common sense an air fryer for 5 quid ain?€?t gonna be great ????",5,08/12/2023
Unethical business practice this so called company may have cheaper products that most retailers and the quality is OK. But there ethics are totally outrageous. Ordered from them again and was told my parcel would be split into two packages which did not mind. Received one package ok but I've never received the second package on contacting temur was told I would have to wait ten days before they would even consider sending out replacements or issuing a refund. Sorry this is not the way to keep your customers coming back and continuing to use you. Very bad business practice. Not happy at all as I'm now out of pocket by quite a bit of money and no products and a customer service team that don't even seem to give a damn.,1,08/12/2023
"I am absolutely gob smacked with the negative reviews,  as I am sympathetic with the service you have experienced , I myself have had not problems at all , they get thombs up from me everyday of the week",5,08/12/2023

Received package a day later and as promised I received ??5 credit I ordered a smartwatch and men?€?s perfume a copy of top brand all were good quality and considering the price which cost me about ??15 I cannot complain.,4,09/12/2023
"Can't fault this company. Customer  service & refunds are instant. Free shipping & free returns. I've had over 12 orders from them. All better than expected.I'm also an Evri courier who delivers these, and we deliver 1000's. Huge range of products. Some wonderful bargains, some a bit tacky. But overall Highly, Highly Recommended.",5,09/12/2023
Happy with price and quality. Fast delivery.,5,09/12/2023
"I order from Temu at least several times a month and have always had great experiences with the products ordered, the quality is the same as you would get from other large sellers but at a fraction of the price  Items are delivered within the estimated delivery window sometimes even earlier!!! Some reviews say the pics can be misleading but if you take the time to read the actual descriptions and be attentive to the option you select it should eliminate buyer error when ordering. I highly recommend Temu????",5,09/12/2023
The order I put in was for wall hidden shoe cabinets. What I received was a 3in1 phone charger. Try sending several emails and didn't receive a reply. This is not great customer service. Will not use this site again and not suggesting it for anyone.,1,09/12/2023
I don't know what I expected but my god the quality is awful. Delivery was pretty fast so no complaints there. 2 orders arrived in good time. Poorly packaged. Strange smell (like glue) when opening packages. Items are really cheap looking which explains the price. If you want cheap then use temu. Also they are extremely annoying with daily messages. Constant texts and emails.,2,09/12/2023
"when i saw the prices on this site i was as many others a bit sceptical, but i have ordered from them three or four times now and even ordered for my neighbour, we have both been delighted with the service and the items ordered, from beautiful bedding to false nails we have never had any problems,free shipping, great tracking,fast delivery, we will continue to use this site with no qualms what so ever,,,,",5,09/12/2023
We had a car accident and chose our body shop because of its proximity to our home and endorsed by our insurance company. Despite difficulties in getting parts etc the car was delivered much faster than expected. We had a couple of issues which were rectified quickly and well. One issue lingered not due the shop but due me and insurance. When I contacted the shop they took immediate action. Today my car is being repaired. The staff are friendly and competent. It?€?s a pleasure to go there. I highly recommend it and I seldom do that.,5,09/12/2023
"Really poor quality,half of it doesn't work,is crushed or broken also ordered 6 stair lights only got 2,wasnt actually that cheap considering a quarter of the order was broken and didn't work.Had to throw that stuff away no point in paying a fortue to send it back,will never use again,dont waste your hard earned cash",1,09/12/2023

"I was a bit dubious having read some negative reviews. However I placed an order for a few little stocking fillers plus a t-shirt for myself, postage free. I'm delighted with the items I've received, especially considering the low cost. A couple of things had been damaged in the post but it was easy to contact Temu. I added a photo showing the damaged items and I got an immediate refund for the damaged items !I am very impressed and I will definitely buy from them again :)",5,10/12/2023

Low quality products No where what is shown on web site,1,10/12/2023
Temu gives eBay and Amazon and other online services a real run for there money.Yes it's china don't expect 100% perfect but 90% of the goods are better made than what's been coming out of Europe,4,10/12/2023
"Do not waste your time, started the fish game to get some small free items. Initially it was fine getting fish food, but as you get close they make it virtually impossible to collect fish. A big con just to get more people on the app. Temu, If you reply this review, tell me why you trick people to do this? I actually thought the items I ordered were good but now I will be going back to Amazon, they don't trick you.",1,10/12/2023
I LOVE this Web site!!!!  The clothes are gorgeous and good quality. My go-to site for EVERYTHING. Prices are slashed from retail.,5,11/12/2023
I would advise great caution using this site. Read the reviews. Most of the good ones are almost exactly the same wording. Sometimes words may be in a different order. All advertise same items within their review and offer their own discount code. This cannot be right. I have yet to read a good review that sounds genuine. Additional - following generic reply saying nothing of use. Very keen to use Temu so looked up reviews. Nothing further I can say to describe. Nearly all good reviews contain the same words in a different order. Clearly scripted. All Temu replies seem generic. Still wondering whether or not to take the chance. Didn't.,1,11/12/2023
"Imballaggio inesistente, quindi oggetti in plastica deformati dal trasporto. Oggetti che costano pochissimo e pochissimo mi aspettavo: ma un nulla sotto zero no.

"Not a great customer experience, specifically when it comes to returns and return shipments.Specifically, here's the scenario that Temu could not seem to understand or manage.I placed one order of multiple items. Temu shipped this order across multiple shipments. They did not send the order in one shipment/one box.When I went to return most of these items, Temu's return system would only generate one free label (for one box/parcel, etc). While I understand the policy is only to provide one free label, and after that subsequent labels carry a fee, in this case, they sent the original order across multiple packages, so it was IMPOSSIBLE for me to send everything back together in one parcel, using the one free label. Therefore, before initiating the return, I explained the situation to customer service and asked if they would refund me for the additional labels since they are associated with returns for the one order, being done all at once. They told me to initiate the returns and then they would refund me the money for the additional labels. I opened a ticket with them requesting the refund to my credit card, and they proceeded to pull a bait and switch, saying they only offer one free label. I re-explained the context numerous times but they kept insisting they only provide one free label. Eventually, they said they would refund me for the additional labels but just as credit to my temu account, after which followed numerous messages back and forth of my insisting they needed to refund to my credit card, as the issue was a result of their return process and system not taking into account this nuance and that they were the ones who broke up the shipment of the order. Had they sent the items in one box, I would have returned them in the same box, requiring only one label, but they did not do this, so I it was not possible for me to send back everything in one parcel.They still have not refunded me. I will not be buying from them again until they sort out their customer service (need to be able to understand nuance and have agency to manage customer queries logically, not according to a limited script) and update their returns process and system to account for the way they ship items in the first place. The customer should not be penalised if they send an order across multiple packages.Update 22.9.23 - Temu have responded to this review with nothing but a general suggestion to message their customer service team. Temu, I've already had a ticket open with the customer service team and no one will address the nuance of the situation and refund me the additional return labels to my credit card.",1,11/12/2023
Altho some stuff is def cheap and reasonable quality I have had constant pop ups promising two free gifts if I buy five items. Add one to cart and get a nesssge ?€?this will surely be FREE?€? but when I get to checkout I haven?€?t been given any items free even though I have bought the required  number of items. VERY FRUSTRATING !,4,11/12/2023
"I started using Temu a few months ago and if I could give it ten stars I would, unfortunately I can only give 5. I've bought everything from keyrings to trainers, bedthrows to socks. Honestly,  the best quality I've had from an online shopping experience.  Love the jumpers, true to size and warm and cosy.  Delivery hasn't been a problem so far. I'd recommend temu to everyone.",5,11/12/2023
"They have stolen my designs and used my artwork without my permission! I tried reporting my product stolen via their IP portal, but the portal keeps presenting errors.

Now we have to rely on their portal which does not work. Keep getting ""System is busy"" error. Please support artists directly, do not purchase from stores like this!",1,11/12/2023

Absolutely awful to their customers, keep relying to questions with the same generic answers.",1,11/12/2023

An item I didn't order arrived today.  A pair of sunglasses. I'm housebound.  The 5 in  1 Walker / wheelchair with 80% off that I did  I order did not arrive.  It was a scam.  After 3 years of being housebound I ordered this item to enable me to start exercising and help me to start getting out and about again. Enjoying the sunshine.  It is almost winter here and the only place I have been is hospital.  I don't like being scammed but that is what has happened   I don't know how to reply to Temu.It's possible that TEMU are not responsible for the scam that someone is piggybacking on to their website.if so they need to know they are being hacked.  I saw the what seemed to be an authentic website video so bought the item. A  wheelchair/walker upgraded to a 5 in 1 electric .  However th sunglasses I did receive are definitely not polarized.  The case they came in is of better quality to be honest.  The email I got which I can send a copy of to you was over stamped. I will do that separately.,1,12/12/2023

"Temu has the potential to be an amazing company, however it does feel like a very public scam. The reason I state this is a few things. The first I placed many orders but as soon as there was an issue, a missing item that they obviously didn?€?t package, they become quite rude and aggressive. They state they have checked the warehouse and confirm the item was packed. I therefore asked for this evidence because I have proven to them it wasn?€?t in the package, to which they say they cant release that information to me. Hang on, if you can prove it was packaged, how can you then not send the customer the proof? When you ask to raise a complaint or speak to management, the advisors state that they are the highest point of contact. That again is absolutely bizarre. Don?€?t all companies have management structures? They have ?€?scammed?€? me out of a bit of money and won?€?t acknowledge they are actually in the wrong. Humans make errors, I don?€?t care about that and understand, but for a company to full on lie and not back it up, that is not in my eyes how you do business.Also, look on trust pilot, they answer back to positive reviews but robotic responses for the negative. Maybe they would have a higher rating if they understood things do go wrong and just own up to it. Their packaging also is absolutely ridiculous. They package things so tight that items get bend, broken etc and when you tell them as feedback, they are not interested at all. They say they will pass it on, but you know they haven?€?t, because it happens again and again. I?€?ll continue to use shein at least they package goods well and their customer service is 5*.TEMU I suggest you look at yourselves and adjust your companies model, maybe you then will be one of the best companies for a bargain. Actually have a complaints department, and realise each country have their own rules on consumer rights, it doesn?€?t matter if it?€?s a company outside that country. I don?€?t hold my breath for a response but I?€?m hoping more and more people put a honest review on all sites and maybe they will learn this isn?€?t the way to do business.Update: TEMU response is inaccurate and an outright lie. My parcel has gone missing. The carrier has confirmed the unsafe delivery and given me an incident number for TEMU as proof. I asked TEMU for a refund even if account credit and supplied all evidence to them. They rejected the refund 3 times, with the same robotic response. They didn?€?t take the evidence into account whatsoever. Their Temu's Purchase Protection program is an absolute lie. They don?€?t take anything into account and the 3 responses I got from them were the same response copy and paste, identical. So unfortunately no, they don?€?t protect you at all and are just robotic in their responses.",1,12/12/2023

"During a ""sale event"" I ordered a 4 wheeled electric golf scooter (for adults). They sent me a cheap pair of sunglasses instead, and then said I could keep them and they would refund half of what I paid for the scooter! The other option they gave was for ME to pay for return shipping from the UK to China before receiving a refund! I have instructed my card company to recover my money.Avoid these crooks at all cost. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.UPDATE: AFTER TELLING TEMU THAT I HAD INSTRUCTED MY CARD COMPANY TO RECALL MY PAYMENT, THEY'VE SUDDENLY STOPPED INSULATING ME WITH THEIR ""GENEROUS"" OFFER FOR ME TO KEEP THE INCORRECTLY SENT ITEM FOR HALF THE PRICE I PAID FOR THE ELECTRIC SCOOTER! HOW ABOUT YOU JUST SEND ME WHAT I ORDERED INSTEAD OF FAKING CONCERN ABOUT ALL THE HASSLE YOU HAVE CAUSED ME. IT TELLS ME THAT THIS WAS A SCAM FROM THE START",1,12/12/2023
"Refusing to give me a refund even AFTER they confirmed receiving my returns. What a bunch of knobheads, they must use the excitement of ripping people off to compensate for for their pathetic manhood.",1,13/12/2023
"Iv ordered from temu multiple times, and all but one order got to me in the time it was expected. One order did get lost, but temu gave me a credit for the order within 5 minutes of contacting them. I reordered what was in stock not all of it was, but I got different items instead. They even gave me an extra 5 dollars for the order getting lost. I know some have had problems with them, But my personal experience on  quite a few orders I've made now, is everything went pretty good. The products were all better than I honestly had expected for the price I paid. Shipping was fast, considering its coming all the way from china. A week was about average. Thats just my personal experience with them. I haven't had anything that I needed to return yet, so I cant really comment on their returns. But they were great on my one package that got lost.",5,13/12/2023
absolutely scam... avoid the product is bad promotions is fake games are ridicules and fake it is an app that make you offers then slowly u will notice that they are playing you IE fish game to earn free product and the spin that they start with perfect by at the end when people download the app and buy from the site you do not get the credit for it all fake offers,1,13/12/2023

Pleasantly surprised. Goods arrived earlier than expected. Items although not top quality were better than expected. Always check the full description though before ordering as pictures often show multiple products but price is for one unit. Otherwise - no issues to date,4,13/12/2023
"First of all, ask yourself how many of these reviews are legitimate ? A good indication is how many 5 star reviews replicate the same wording and explain in detail how to get and use the app. Why would you tell people how to use an App in a review ? Secondly, before you even think about downloading the App, have a quick read of Time magazine's article on Temu and the Chicago news' Temu article which confirms that Temu is a vehicle for identity theft. ( Sorry, Trust pilot doesn't allow links)If that's not enough to put you off, then you deserve to be scammed!Finally, consider this. For all their faults all the big online retailers have checks and balances in place to prevent the scammers from successfully taking your money. With Temu, you are, in fact,  dealing directly with the seller, without any intervention. The goods advertised on Temu appear to be linked directly back to the Chinese Companies who manufactured them. As with all manufactured Chinese crap, its not worth buying compared to the quality goods manufactured to EU and American standards. These companies are largely unregulated and if you write to the Chinese Embassy about any problems you've encountered ( Yes, you're on your own on this one ) you don't even get the courtesy of a reply ! They couldn't give a dam.So, why make an aggressive, despotic autocracy like China any more wealthy than it is  . . . . when all you're going to get is crap ?Its up you ? Don't say you haven't been warned!",1,13/12/2023

"All the 5 Star reviews are fake. The deals are not deals at all. The price is different from the price in your cart at checkout. You never get the actual deal when you hit one click purchases. The shipping dates if you watch them carefully will change so they don't have to issue you a credit that they swear by. The items we purchased were of the cheapest quality and very poorly packed in a bag, most items in the bags were loose and damaged. When I tried to contact customer service it's all animated. No one to talk to. Never a resolve. If your not happy with your purchase suck it up. You will never get a refund. My wife's still waiting on a refund from March, it's now September. They will try everything from saying they didn't receive it until you prove it, to you sending the wrong item and even saying They were mis used and blame the customer. You will never get a refund, if your lucky you will get a partial credit on select items. This company is a total scam and needs to be held responsible for ripping people off.",1,14/12/2023
I found shipping on Temu is a Hit and a miss but the good thing about it  the Customer service is very good and very fair. If an item is faulty or your not happy they are willing to rectify things.

I contacted customer services and was amazed to find i was chatting to an actual person, who offered to make contact with the seller for me.The problem with Temu for me, is that it is too addictive, there are so many bargains its hard to resist lol.",5,14/12/2023

"Price, products and delivery are solid.  Also, having read the reviews here it is interesting that the company generally does not respond to negative reviews. That leaves the impression that they do not want to address customer issues and concerns.  Now my concern: Games are not transparent and I would not recommend playing them to win prizes UNLESS you intend to engage in solicitations or referrals, as you apparently cannot ""win"" without doing so.  I have continue to play FARMLAND.  I have reached $99, one dollar away from ""winning.""  What has occurred is the game putting me into to perpetual loop of earning water and watering without allow for the harvesting of the wheat.  I have been in this state for more than two weeks.  The game allowed me to reach this position rather easily and now has changed the ""reward"" system for watering and harvesting.  It constantly prompts for referrals or product purchases.  Thus be forwarded that either or both are necessary for you to possibly advance to a ""win.""",3,15/12/2023
As a loyal and repeat customer of Temu I have recently seen a decline in customer service. Could this be as Temu are becoming more successful? I recently made an order but it never arrived and so I chatted with a customer service advisor who was quite abrupt and who showed no empathy whatsoever! I requested a full refund and was told it would be with me in 5 days. I am so dissatisfied with Temu on this occasion and this will have S big impact on whether or not I shop with them in the future,1,15/12/2023
I have previously placed two orders and received all the items. On my third order I received the complete wrong order. Temu refunded me within 5 minutes of notifying them.,4,15/12/2023
"I recently purchased a product from TEMU, and I must say I was quite disappointed with my overall experience. While the price of the item was reasonable, it's essential to consider the value you receive for what you pay.The main issue I encountered was with the product's quality. It fell short of my expectations, and it's safe to say that the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies here. While the low price initially seemed like a great deal, when combined with the subpar quality of the product, it doesn't end up feeling like a good bargain at all.Regrettably, this experience has left me hesitant to make any future purchases from TEMU. I value products that offer a good balance between affordability and quality, and, unfortunately, this particular item did not meet those criteria.I understand that everyone's preferences and experiences may vary, but I felt it necessary to share my honest feedback. I hope this review helps both TEMU and potential customers make informed decisions in the future.",1,15/12/2023
Temu is great. People say its bad quality or it feels cheap well probably because you bought it for a cheap price.. But everything I got was good quality and works nice. The delivery take 2 weeks or less but if its later than that then you will get $5 credit which is really good. I also told my friends and family about the app and they love it. Its affordable and has everything you need so I will give Temu a 5/5,5,15/12/2023
I ordered around 145?€?00 worth of items when I got the shirts 7 of them did not fit right I started a refund in July and got sick and couldn?€?t finish I tried in September and was out of the refund time but the person I was chatting with gave me credit for the shirts and not to send back also I have ordered several times and no problems,5,15/12/2023
I am very satisfied with this company even though I know they sell a lot of cheap stuff that in the end when I go to all the website it's the same thing but quite honestly the customer service is very good has been a couple of times and I have an issue with a product and they never give me a hard time to reimburse or give me the choice of credit. Now they got a little games here and there promise you also the prices that want to today to me is a waste of time because I know in the end they're not going to give you anything for free they keep making you playing this game so you could buy more stuff in the way that's kind of take people for ignorant in my case I think that's kind of disrespectful but above all to buy stuff they have a lot of stuff to buy and a lot of stuff that is very useful.,5,15/12/2023
"Received my 1st order today, like others i was very skeptical but so far so good 1 item is smaller than expected but that doesnt matter, i do play the games but if i dont get the freebie i dont mind, took just over a week to arrive and it was free shipping so cant complain. Got some other's on order so hopefully they all arrive ok aswell.

"I started shopping with Temu in August of this year and have ordered a lot of things particularly for my new puppy.  I have had to send some items back but generally the quality is the same as anything from a Chinese store in town.  The shipping times are going longer and longer however which is why I stopped using Wish.  So I think I may stop using it, but the refund policy is automatic for the first product and then they supply a free label for the second. So it's pleasant to use.  I don't do any affiliations or games I just order for myself.",5,15/12/2023
"I had a problem with a delivery, made on Temu's behalf by Evri. Evri claimed to have delivered a product to my home, but had not delivered it to where I specifically told the driver to deliver it to, and it had disappeared in the time it took me to get home. I thought I would have huge problems getting this sorted, but Temu were fantastic. Rohim, the customer agent was amazing: efficient, super polite, and immediately gave a full refund, even though he only had my word for it that the delivery had not been made. It is the best service I have ever received from an online shopping company.",5,15/12/2023

"Temu is an online marketplace, with tons of different sellers.  You have to check to see that you have the best price for the item you want.  Different sellers may have the same item at a different price.  There is a sort feature, where you can sort by price.  The shipping takes about a week-and-a-half, usually, but is very reliable.  There's a credit automatically given if your item is late.  Returns are very easy.No store is perfect, but Temu is very good.  I highly recommend them.",5,15/12/2023

Returned my first item and received a refund. Now they have taken the money back from my account. I contacted them and their reply was the item had not been received.

"Well I guess maybe I have been lucky or maybe just more careful? Was told about TEMU by my sister who has ordered a few lots from them. She is happy so decided to give them a try. I placed an order for a variety of small bits and bobs for just over ??50. Got regular emails to let me know the parcel was coming and it turned up very quickly. All was present and correct except for one item. A step drill turned into 6 plastic screw caps like you'd find on tubes of glue. The plastc box they were in was labeled as a step drill but was taped up and obviously 'tampered with'.I went to the review section and entered 1 star. Immediately I was asked what the problem was. I told them and sent three photos. I was offered a credit on my next order- fine with me.Anyone who has bought from China should know that the quality of goods is very very variable. You enter a lottery and must expect that much of what's on offer will be pretty poor. If you keep this in mind you will not be disappointed. I would never buy any tool I needed to be fit for hard use but for DIY work it will probably be ok. (A set of 50 drill bits for under ??3 will be pretty rubbish and we should all be sensible enough to know it). The same applies to anything else. If it looks too good to be true......So- my experience has been pretty good so far and I am putting in another order. Despite the blatantly obvious fake reviews here this company is just like Banggood, Aliexpress etc except the orders are delivered quicker. Be careful what you buy and all should be well.",5,16/12/2023
I must admit I'm a bit surprised. I buy all my purse hardware from China and typically buy through another big company. I figured I'd give Temu a shot though.The hardware was exactly what I wanted and it's perfect! The scissors were very sharp. The prices were excellent and shipping was quick. My biggest WOW moment was the way everything was packaged. It's was awesome!I always read bad stuff on TrustPilot so I thought I'd leave them a good review for this order. I will be buying from the again very soon.,5,16/12/2023
Most of their items are cheaper than UK prices but they are cheap for an obvious reason - the majority of what they offer is tat. Or poor quality.,2,16/12/2023

"Shocking customer service, and even further appalling service when escalated to their investigation team.  I had been with Temu (had as I've now deleted my account) thought I would give them a try.  Had no issues until I recieved another really good offer of the ??100 vouchers which is broken down but time limited.  My order went through, my payment was taken immediately from my bank through Clearpay and all my confirmation emails were received, except from Temu!!!! No confirmation from them about my order.  I went back to my Temu account to see my items were still in my basket.  Temu said the items had not been paid for even though I sent them every evidence of proof of payment.  All I kept being sent was pre-scripted messages to try pacify me.  Luckily Clearpay were very understanding and they dealt with the situation promptly and it was noted that Temu had not fulfilled the order and my money will be refunded but may take up to 10 working days.  As for Temu, they take no responsibility and are not willing to fix issues which where fault clearly falls at their feet.  I would highly recommend you avoid this company if you value your money.  I gave the benefit of doubt, but then it's true what they say, it's easy to say that until it happens to you.... trust me, I did say it, and it very quickly soon after did happen to me.  The voucher hype isn't all its made out to be.",1,17/12/2023
"I love shopping on Temu and always find fun and quirky items I can't find in the uk, however after many orders with them and spending quite a sum of money, I'm not impressed with the promotions and games like fish land! It's starts off well , then literally feels like you will never reach the end to get your free gift!!!

"So i've been using temu for a little while now,and I can say it's pretty good really. It's really cheap,kind of like shein but a little better i guess? The gifts are legit, too. I got 15 dollars from playing on paypal but trust me it may take a while and you need a bunch of people unless you have a lot of friends. But overall,it's a good app. But you still have to be careful with some of the things in this Temu app because some people also get scammed or robbed. I'm not saying it's a bad app and you shouldn't get it because it's pretty good for a online shopping app tbh. I like the app but i think it should improve the little ""free gifts credit"" thingys because it is a little bit rigged. Yes,it may be a peramid scheme but i've never seen any better and almost every online shop does that right? But yeah, it's good!! But please also be aware that the games are rigged like I said. Some of the games (or all tbh) have this trick that if you shared and got all the cutting prices then when you share and invite other people not only they lower the prices for you to have less time,but they give you only 1-3 days to finish. Now i'm not saying it's not that much or anything but still,it may take a while to do this because not that much people have a lot of friends like other people do. So they should really fix that and they are lucky I gave them 5 stars. (which i guess?? they deserve idrk). Have a great day my dear friends!!",5,17/12/2023
Received our first order from Temu today.  Until today I didn?€?t think you could make something as cheap as they provide.  Quality is terrible.  Not to mention the mysterious charges on my card that started to appear a week later from them.  Had to file a dispute and get a new card.  AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!,1,17/12/2023
"3 of my 7 orders were 1 day late?€? really did receive $15 credit ($5 each) to spend on anything we wanted!  They shipped out fast, but OnTrac was the cause of the delay in those 3 packages.  Was so worried about quality but everything has been well worth the price.  The Diamond Painting kits are much nicer than expected for the low price?€? we?€?ve gotten at least 20 if not more.  All the stickers that my son orders have arrived undamaged even when we were worried about what the outside of the package looked like.  Great company!!  Customer Service answers right away when I?€?ve had questions about products and my orders!  Will continue to order from them for sure!",5,17/12/2023
Ordered several prints which arrived really quickly.  Impressed with the quality and price.Have already ordered more.,5,17/12/2023
"I would definitely avoid this company at all costs!  It was a nightmare experience for me.  I placed one order which they split into 3 separate shipments.  Keeping track of their order was almost impossible.  Seems like I was getting 3 to 4 emails everyday!  You can forget trying to talk to a person - it won't happen.  Every phone call is fully automated.  They are very high pressure by constantly try to suck you in through ""gimmijck"" ads and offers.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!  Don't buy in to their gimmicks",1,17/12/2023
"I have 4 items to return, but my printer will not print a return form from you. It might just be me but, I find the procedure to print is overly complicated, consequently I am left with 4 unwanted items",1,17/12/2023

Do not order from Temu if you need the correct order in good time.I ordered from Temu for the first time and the they sent me the wrong size leaving me without the product I need for this weekend.,1,18/12/2023
"If you want your phone/tablet/computer hacked, this is the site to go to. After you open your account you will suddenly get contact requests for Skype, Facebook etc, all because Temu & it's associates hacked your contacts etc. They are cheap, they are quick and they are Chinese.

I have had a few orders from temu now and every order has arrived within the dates stated and most items are fantastic quality. the clothes  are not all of great quality I had to return some items which was a quick and simple transaction soon as they received the returns my refund was given with no trouble,4,18/12/2023
"Was a bit sceptical about ordering from the site, however I decided to give it a go, the prices were so good and so tempting, I just couldn't resist placing the order.Ordered a lego set (clearly a copy at that price) & a newton's cradle (??18 in total) Order arrived a couple of days later. The packaging wasn't suitable for the items ordered as all the boxes inside were crushed. As it was for myself it didn't bother me, but would have been disappointing had they been gifts. Unfortunately the newton's cradle was totally broken during transit, but gave pictures to Temu and they refunded straight away. As for the lego, it looks okay on first inspection, the only negative is, the instructions are images only, so might be a bit tricky to assemble, at 10,000 pieces should be challenging. The lego pieces are also tiny (which was made. clear on ordering - just didn't expect them to be quite so small). An update... I've returned the lego set, as the damage to the box in transit just got to me too much, also the pieces are much much smaller than expected. The instructions are of no use either. Temu sorted the return superfast, which I was really impressed by, hence I've upgraded my review from a 3* up to a 4*, excellent customer service.",4,18/12/2023
"Be very aware. I have bought several items from them over four orders with feedback scores of fours and fives. However, one item that was defective I scored them 'one' on and within several minutes my link to them has been blocked totally. I am still awaiting delivery of some shoes, which should be imminent, and I can't even get them on the screen. Woh betide you if you score them low.",1,18/12/2023
"Have been avoiding Temu like the plague. However, someone seems to have signed up for an account with my email address. One star review as I can't seem to get in touch with to Temu to tell them that this is fraudulent behaviour, without creating an account myself...which I obviously don't want to do! Face palm.*Reply received from Temu today, asking me to get in touch via the website or app. They have clearly not read my review properly, or maybe they just don't know how their own website works - I can't get in touch this way as I don't want an account and you can't get through on the web chat without setting up a Temu account...beggars belief.",1,18/12/2023

Everything I have ordered has been as described. I know generally it is cheap and nasty but so is kmart and reject shop etc.  I don't play any games that I see mentioned but I am happy,5,18/12/2023
"Loving Temu.  Quick delivery, much better than some other online marketplaces. All goods as expected and with clothing I would say the sizing is pretty consistent and the quality better than I might have expected.  Got a refund into my account in under 30 minutes of requesting (my error, muddled up shoe sizes) and with no requirement to return the item - feel free to gift it, they said.  Also 2 x $5 credits unprompted as they felt the delivery had been slower than they expected.  A few freebies playing Fishland.  I may need to join or start a support group for other Temu addicts - I'm hooked ????",5,18/12/2023
Placed two orders with this cowboy firm received Royal mail tracking details on both parcels then on Sunday past i get a message your parcel has been delivered Strange as royal mail do not deliver on a Sunday so two days latter get the same message parcels been delivered again nothing was delivered TOTAL SCAM SITE BEWARE !,1,18/12/2023

"I have brought many items from temu happily spending ??200+ but two delivery?€?s via Evri were left on doorstep never to be seen again,despite a note saying please leave next door,On contacting temu and evri both deny responsibility temu sending email via trustpilot saying contact them but when I?€?ve tried I get blocked I?€?m totally fed up with them even PayPal are refusing to help,thought they were great at first,but now ????????just refund ??27.10 you?€?re not being good to customers",1,18/12/2023
"I like their item listing but I don't like the delivery service this company insists to use (PiggyShip).[Edit to add] Temu responded to my review saying they would follow it up, but the only action they actually took is to flag my review as fake. I provided the evidence to Trustpilot, which has now been verified by them.",3,18/12/2023

I love temu very helpful. Great products for small price. Even if a item wasn't in the order they refund you straight away or if something don't fit they either refund you (without having to send it back) and best of all free shipping. And quick delivery.,5,19/12/2023
"I have no idea why they have so many bad reviews! Love temu so much, had some really good quality stuff from there, the few issues I?€?ve had customer service was great and I got refunded! Recommend to anyone :)",5,19/12/2023
"I was very reluctant to respond to the many prompts on my phone about Temu, but eventually curiosity got the better of me. We really did think this was some clever trick so decided to make a small purchase as a test. Well, we are now regular shoppers with Temu so my doubts were completely removed. We were even more impressed by the best customer service I have encountered in my many years, when having to return an item which didn't quite fit we were issued with an immediate refund to PayPal and as a bonus (a one off I'm sure) we were told we did not have to return the item! A return I made to another well known national brand took nearly a month and many phone calls to pay back. Temu is now our first stop to check our requirements, and a company we readily recommend to all",5,19/12/2023
Welcome temu and for next buying cheap things,5,19/12/2023
I?€?ve made several orders from this site and never had any issues with payments & shipping.,5,19/12/2023
"Temu had special offer in the form of a spinning wheel, it stopped at a ridiculous amount. The price was ??11.24 and reduced to ??3.14. When it came to checking out and paying the price had risen to ??11.24!! Once I had checked out (thinking the price would revert to the discount price) I  was informed by PayPal the amount charged was ??11.24. Contacted them and they gave every excuse under the sun to try and get out of their commitment. BE VERY CAREFUL with this company. Bottom line is they are not all they profess to be.",1,19/12/2023
I?€?m writing this review regarding my experience of Temu.com  . I found Temu?€?s website  an easy and pleasurable experience its simple to navigate through their website They even keep customers updated on the tracking throughout the dispatch to customer receiving their goods . That?€?s the pros .The cons are simple each and everything I purchased was of poor quality. They are all Chinese inferior quality products. It indicates that they are from America on the tracking site. In reality it?€?s all rubbish from china . I guess you get what you pay for .you buy cheap you get cheap rubbish,2,19/12/2023

You are miraculous Thank you so much,5,19/12/2023
I like this company. Postage has always been on time. Items are generally as described. items can be a bit cheap looking but look at the prices. I have only had one item that was broken but as it was only 87p I wasn't too bothered. I have placed 3 orders so far and I will be buying more. I have never done games etc just purchases.,4,19/12/2023

"I when you need support either you won?€?t get a response or if you do get a response it will be totally about something else and not about what you just said.

After more than a half hour, I received a response totally off the subject twice, that I initially asked about?€?.leaves me wondering who?€?s minding the store?€?.giving these as gifts is hard when I get told they?€?re not sure how to use or put an item together.",1,19/12/2023
Love it. So much cheaper than AliExpress,5,19/12/2023
"I love Temu. I highly recommend them. Shipment arrives, nice clothes, very happy to take returns. Never had bad results as I have with other Facebook based phoney sites (Matalan/Strigie and Wilko).",5,19/12/2023
"Temu support service is very poor. The bot is not clear and when you do get a person, they take ages to respond.  You end up waiting ages and achieving nothing. Service has gone downhill. Was fine a few weeks ago.I was trying to get help with an issue on 11th September from 19.29 to 23.13. I asked for an email to send complaint to a couple of times. I was not given this information.  Was finally told my issue would be dealt with by an agent and a ticket has been created. All I got was an email stating what one of the support team had said.My issue is that all customers should be treated the same. Why do some have a minimum spend and others don't.  Temu change their prices within an hour so if you don't place your order immediately,  the price increases.  I missed out on 2 good deals yesterday. Temu are welcome to contact me. I have the ticket reference if needed.13/09/23: updateMinimum spend removed for 48 and then suddenly it is there again.  Why temu?",1,19/12/2023

"I saw this on a social channel and was looking for a nice new watch.  I wish I had dug deeper into reviews. I bought it.  A nice ""Lige"" watch.  Leather strap etc, multiple dials.  All the reviews looked good.Get read for a ton of popups and weird things.I ordered it.  It arrived. Put it on. Immediately noticed all THREE dials didn't work.  One was a stop watch, not a 'seconds', and it was so tiny, it was unusable anyway.So I contacted them to return it.  Hoping it goes through fine.I submitted a 1 star review.  When you go to your orders, you can see your review.  Go to the product and you see NO low starred reviews.  They have a little Down Icon to expand the ""Keywords"" of reviews.  Such as REcommended, fast shippign etc...Expand it and THEN you see ""Low Rating"", and even the it is a soft grey text, so it doesn't stand out.That's where you see all the 1 stars where they are shockingly bad.  Mine is still not in that review list.A friend bought some 'leaf lights' to go over their mantle piece.  The pic is at an angle and looks good, with thick leaves and lights.  In real life, it's a leaf everything 30cm or so.  Really really poor.You get what you pay for, and I wish I had read all the rubbish about TEMU.   No way would I buy from that system again.  Shocks about poss Chinese 'spying', and all sorts.Be VERY way of this website or App.  To their credit, I hope they are going to do the refund when it arrives back.  But shocked at how poor that watch was.  How much they hide the bad reviews, and the shocking stuff I have since read about it.",1,20/12/2023
UPDATE: i have upgraded to a 3 star because after much time spent talking with them they did actually resend the item and all the pieces came with it this time so this is much appreciated. Thank youWhile parts of the order were ok the most expensive item was a backpack trolley sent with 1 wheel so completely useless and when refunding the response was not to worry either sell it on (to whom its useless) and heres half the money back. First order to test the waters and not impressedIf i could add a picture to this to prove this is a real review and not fake like may are nowadays i would. But i dont think that is possible?,3,20/12/2023

"Just received 10 Items from TEMU that I purchased through an offer from them! They are supposed to be worth ??280.00 of which I had to pay for two items value ??28!Do Not Buy unless you like really CHEAPLY MADE Chinese knockoff products.Now we all buy products and items bought from China and other countries and to be fair you can get done really good stuff, however the 10 different items I bought the charity store in town rejected all of them, I then went to a second charity store and they were again rejected! They are now all in the bin and my bank account has ??28 less in it!",1,20/12/2023

Order always comes quicker than expected. Absolutely buying little things off there!,5,20/12/2023
"Temu doesnt do proper refund of the items returned. They ask the customers to return the multiple items in a single parcel, which arrived with different orders placed. When we return it, they simply mention that the item is not received and deny the refund. Also its noted that they deny refund of the costliest items that were returned. They dont have the voice helpline. Only through the chat they try to sort it and these kind of issues were not sorted at all.",1,20/12/2023
Excellent company excellent product at excellent prices.,5,20/12/2023
"I ordered 3 things from Temu. One was absolutely fine, as I expected, one was ok - not quite as the pictures had shown, and one was awful - cheap looking and nothing like the picture. I put a review on their site and they asked if I?€?d like a refund. I said I would and they immediately agreed. This was last night. This morning the money is in my account, and they said I could keep the item or give it to charity. Which is pretty remarkable for a company to do! I have to say that the delivery was quicker than I expected. I would order from them again but without such high expectations.",4,21/12/2023
"I ordered an electric scooter from TEMU and my money was deducted straight away. I was provided a tracking reference which I checked every once in a while until the package arrived. What I received was a pair of cheap sunglasses - the sort you wouldn't pay more that ??1 for. I checked the tracking reference on the package and it married up with the one I was provided. On contacting the company I was heaped with apologies however they wanted the sunglasses returned before any refund took place. The address they wanted it sent to was in China however the returns address on the package itself was a warehouse in Birmingham which I have since found out acts as a distributor (MPay Services) however it doesn't have it's own website and the internet has several references to this address for problem deliveries. To return the sunglasses to the Chinese address would have cost over ??10 using Evri which I am not prepared to pay. Treat this newly emerging business with caution as you will not know what sort of response you will get. My experience so far is dire so I have no intention of ever using them again and I would suggest you didn't as well. Update - this morning I have been offered a 50% refund if I keep the sunglasses! I never ordered sunglasses, I didn't want sunglasses, they made a mistake sending sunglasses, yet they think I should be penalised due to their own error!ADDITION - the response from TEMU has not resolved the matter. They refuse to acknowledge any order taken and are implying that a fake advertisement suggesting it was TEMU was the case in which case I would treat any advertisement suggesting it is TEMU as fake and not trust it. Until they can clean their act up to protect the people who consider they are ordering from them they have a long way to go to get it right.",1,21/12/2023
"Have ordered 3 times so far. Each order takes a little longer than if ordering from a UK site, but have been kept updated at each stage and the items have arrived safely each time. One hiccup with the delivery company ridiculously ignoring instructions and leaving my parcel on the doorstep of a housebound neighbour I?€?ve never met before! That?€?s down to Evri rather than Temu.The items have been mixed. Some are brilliant and good value for money. Others questionable. One pair of trousers, despite being too big, the material fell to bits when I sat in the car and changed position in the driver?€?s seat. Material used is not fit for purpose, though that?€?s more to do with the manufacturer than the seller. Some of the tops look like cotton on the adverts but arrive and are similar to 1970?€?s polyester. They?€?re still comfortable unless the weather is really hot, when the anticipated cotton would have been better! Non clothing items have been of good quality. Though the magnetic window cleaning tool?€??€?. Strong magnet just not strong enough to hold on double glazed windows as advertised. All in all, can?€?t quite give 5 stars, but they?€?re not far off!",4,21/12/2023

"Trust your instinct. Temu sells cheap tat and then when you receive the product that's nothing like as advertised (eg a Fast Charger that's really a very slow charger, a drain unclogger that snaps inside and clogs your drain), they only refund a small part of the purchase price.Your time is worth more to you than arguing with these jokers.

This company has been promising me a 90% refund for none delivery of goods since August 2023.ON THE 15TH OCTOBER 2023 I AM STILL WAITING FOR THIS REFUND DESPITE REPEATED REMINDERS. To say I am disappointed with this firm is an understatement. I have written to my MP and Trading StandardsGoods ordered June 2023. No sign of them end of August. When I cancelled my order and requested my money back first they offered 60% refund which I refused. I referred them to the 20 emails I sent to them pointing out the Cosumer Goods acto 2015. 1. they had to give a full refund unless they could prove I had signed a goods received. In a memo to me they admitted that their courier whilst they stated I had signed for the goods sent they could not produce any documentation. I have wriiten to the UK Head Office IN Dublic- NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE  TO MY REQUEST FOR A FULL REFUND in accordance with the 2015 Act 2 weeks. Its now 3 weeks since the refund was offered and still no refund. This company is a complete and dishonest sham- Do not buy from them,1,21/12/2023

The orders arrived usually before the est delivery time and I've been pleasantly surprised about the quality of goods received.",1,22/12/2023

"I ordered $143.33 worth of products from temu. I waited and waited due this package to arrive and it never came. I look at my tracking and it says that it was delivered to a different city abd state. I have contacted temu several different time and tickets have been made. They say that it was delivered there abd uses picked it up at that point abd brought it to my give. However, there is no tracking information for uses. Everyrhing as far as actual tracking information stops in Greensboro NC. I have asked for the additional tracking information and they can't provide it abd refuse to do anything about me not getting the package. Their customer service is terrible.",1,23/12/2023
Quality is quite poor but liked the style of clothes.One star as Temu somehow kept my details. I did avoid downloading the app as I read it could be risky. I couldn?€?t delete them from my PayPal automatic payments in wallet - an unwanted procedure anyway- as it stated ?€?pending transaction?€? so could they have charged me again and again without my knowledge? Temu corrected it after a direct email to them to release my details using  the link in PayPal.,1,23/12/2023

"Stuff that I bought was pretty much junk !! Poor quality and cheap Chinese knock offs of certain products.  I'll give one example, I bought a magnetic pick up tool (the strongest one) meant to pick up 5lb and it could barely pick.up a tea spoon !! NO JOKE !! If you look at some of the positive reviews this company has they look pretty similar so my guess would be even they are fake !! THEY WONT BE GETTING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY THATS FOR SURE!!????????",1,23/12/2023

Avoid like the plague they put 2 orders in 1 package the package went missing courier accepted responsibility for leaving in a unsafe place yet temu have refused reshipment all I want is what I've paid for  because a picture was took of my gate not of me accepting the parcel the courier has admitted he left in usafe place at my gate which temu have took as proof of delivery total joke I'm now out of pocket by nearly ??100 but I've got my solicitors on it who are going to make a claim through the small claims court I also have to add that before they come to the decision they wasn't going to reship they haven't once contacted the courier to ask if the parcel was just left or whether someone accepted it because I've been intouch with the courier who lives local,1,23/12/2023

"I have had no problems with Temu at all, I have placed several orders. My goods have all arrived, well packaged & quickly especially in comparison to Wish. If I?€?ve had an issue with a product I?€?ve contacted customer service, been given a refund & so far have kept the item as I have been advised there is no need to return it. My refund is then processed quickly & without delay or issue. My only concern is whether there?€?s any truth in what?€?s being said about the app tracking all I do on my mobile device ???? I imagine this could be true for many other app related services ?????????€???€??? I really don?€?t know, but my experience is great so far  ????",5,23/12/2023
"I felt Compelled to Wright this review given all the negative reviews and people suggesting Temu is a scam site, this is false information!Temu is 100% legit !!!We have ordered from them 4 times and every time the order was received in around 7 days, with everything as ordered and of more than acceptable quality for the price. In fact, the quality to price ratio is more in line with trade price as a posed to low quality.I can highly recommend Temu!They are legit, and any negative reviews probably come from Shein as they are going to suffer now that Temu are on the scene offering a better service, including things like free and fast delivery and clever games and promotions.So glad I tried Temu, they have more than satisfied my expectations and I will continue to buy from them.",5,23/12/2023
Don?€?t waist your money. I had to returned 90% what I bought there. If you choice Temu account they will scammed out of your money. The refund in original payment takes forever and they use all discounts in the item you returned and refunded a lot less.  I tried returned few small things and Temu refunded to the Temu account and to keep the item. They magically withdrew the money back blocked to use any credit. I am stocked with products I didn?€?t like. It is a nightmare. They completely scammed out. They bad  customer. service. I never had any problems with Amazon.,1,23/12/2023
"Hello I got my parcel today and I love it TEMU is a great place to shop at, however there is a big concern on how FedEx left my parcel today. Yes I have contacted them, and wanted to let you know what they are doing at least to me.it was left in a unsecure location in the front entry of the building by the security phone. The delivery person didn't even bother to try contacting me on my security phone, I was home all day. This is very unlike FedEX to do this.Our landlord does not want packages to be left out in the front entry by the security phone the area it must be kept clear at all times for emergency reasons. I have two more parcels coming and I'm very worried on how they will be delivered, I may have to stop shopping here in the future if this continues.",3,23/12/2023

They lost 2 of the item and refund me only 90$ and said sorry.. I give them proof receipt and asked my whole refund money cause it was not my fault either temu warehouse or Canada post lost it. Why should I loss my money but no action no policy about lost item.

Great prices good products the jewelry is amazing, this is a dangerous place for a crafter to go with the Christmas season coming. I don?€?t understand why people do not like Temu.

"Temu is selling garbage to people and when they write bad reviews, Temu accuses them as biased.I wrote a bad review and Temu wants my review taken down, Wow!Temu is saying that I could return the products back to China, meaning I should spend hours and pay the shipping fee, so that maybe and if They think I am eligible, I get my money back for the garbage they sold me!!What a scam!",1,24/12/2023
"Would give less if I could. After hearing that it was good, I made my first order. When it was out for delivery, I get a message from Temu to say it was attempted but no one was in. (I was at home) then I get 3 more of these, I contact Temu to ask where it was to say that they are attempting to deliver. Funny thing is I received an order from Evri for something else on one of the days. Contacted evri for them to say there was an issue and the package is lost. Temu eventually offered me a refund, o could re-order again but at the full price. Requested a refund and then deleted my profile. I?€?d rather know that things will turn up and not have my time wasted.Editing- because I feel this is important. Every bad review Temu say it?€?s a scam and then you have to prove to trust pilot it?€?s not. The company is a joke.",1,24/12/2023

No delivery of my order. Evri states customer refused delivery which is not true as they never delivered. Got in touch with Temu who instantly refunded in full without following up on why my parcel was not delivered. I would have rather had the magnets instead of the refund. Never had a chance to express what i wanted. Really needed the magnets I had ordered and I think Temy should send the items to me again as a good will gesture. Temu now wants me to place another order of the same item and they will ensure delivery. NOT LIKELY !,1,25/12/2023
"Wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered but my experience is good. It was quick for it to come from China (about a week) but it came within the time frame they gave when I was ordering. All products look good, quality is good, shipping was free. Might order again",5,25/12/2023
Excellent prices. Amazing choice of products. Fast delivery. No issues at all.,5,25/12/2023
"I had dreadful experience. The items they send are of low quality and most directly can go to rubbish bin. You should be ready to throw away these items as quality is hit and miss. With Amazon there is quality control and unparalleled customer service. When I returned the item I have been chasing for refund since 4 months. Basically uncaring people are running the show. One can not trust these people to send quality item or refund if any issues. I won?€?t be using them or trusting them at all.Edit on 8/9/23Temu now has advised that they will refund the amount. I had to write and spend lot of time with customer service chat. It used to be always we will refund you when items are received while Evri return always showed items are with Merchant, contact them. Ultimately seems like trust pilot review has made them to I will await for refund to come to my card back.Most 5 star reviews appear very fake as they ask you to play games and get rewards. Temu seems to be replying to only those reviews. Trust pilot should do more to stop fake reviews or bought dishonest reviews.",1,25/12/2023

Some items look better on the web site but for the price it is expected. I love how Temu keeps you informed when your package will arrive and shows you your order. I go to Temu just to look and end up ordering! I have gotten some helpful items from them so I don't have any complaint.,4,26/12/2023

"I had a great experience with Temu. I bought some swimming dresses and honestly I thought that they would be very poor quality and I would lose my money. I decided to risk it. To my surprise,  the swimming dresses arrived within few days and they are good quality. They fit well ( I used the Temu's chart). I  bought different sizes, just in case, and therefore I decided to return those that did not fit. The return process was very simple and smooth. I honestly thought that I would not receive the money back but this company proved to be professional and well organised. They check the items before issuing the refund and this is also a guarantee for the next buyer. I enjoyed buying from Temu and I will certainly reccomend. The whole refund process from request to payment took less than 10 days. Also, the return of the items was free. I do not know if I have been lucky but honestly I had a great experience and I am surprised by the amount of negative reviews.",5,26/12/2023

Also a pair of no tie slip on beach shoes (look like a surfer now lol) brought a pair in local shoe shop and paid half price ??30 (wow none sale ??60) temu just under ??8 and they fit much better than the expensive designer ones..As you can tell I'm now becoming a fan of  them",5,27/12/2023

Rubbish cheap items. Returned the items but saying their warehouse didn?€?t receive them. Typical online retailer where you can?€?t actually speak with someone. Definitely will not be using them again. Stay clear!!,1,27/12/2023
I ordered several things including plant pot trays. I received a small package today with utter crap that I did not order. I contacted their helpline to be told that they had sold out the items that I had ordered so they decided to send me some utter crap instead. Outrageous.Thank you for your reply but that is incorrect.I wasn't given the option to request a temu credit and I cannot see that on your site. As soon as I saw the package I knew something was wrong. This was confirmed when I opened it. So I immediately contacted your support team and told them what had happened. They checked and inform me the items that I had ordered were sold out which is incorrect.If that was the case why didn't temu contact me before hand to tell me so instead of deliberately sending me items  I had not ordered.Furthermore the items sent do not equate to the value I spent. Furthermore your. Online system doesn't recognize that you have sent me the wrong items so in order to get a refund you Temu wants me to send the original items I ordered. That I don't have.I fear I will never get my money back and have been left with items that I did not order and are utter rubbish. I think your business model is predicted on ripping people off so just like your previous namesakes you'll be gone soon.Please customers avoid as you will get ripped off too and lose your prescious time trying to get a refund and face complications that you didn't expect.,1,27/12/2023
Made in china garbage nothing is matching description.  No quality product at all,1,27/12/2023
This is such a weird website. You order something and 5 days after something was anticipated to arrive it doesn't and you contact them to find out what's happening and they instantly refund you without question. It's not exactly a scam because they refund you but it's clear they're selling products they don't actually have/can't deliver. I would guess they're making money off people that don't follow up.

"Temu is a legitimate online shopping company who have delivered all my orders/items and parcels within a week and of a good standard to the UK. For that reason, they are 'trust' worthy.Indeed some of the pop up's for coupon/money off games/gimmicks within the app are very unnecessary & I personally just avoid them. I also turned off the notifications from the app on my phone and also changed my E Mail notifications to just receiving updates on the package delivery only.Seems those leaving negative reviews here just do so based on an 'app' experience then an actual experience of 'trust'.",5,28/12/2023

"Some products are very good, whilst a large range of items are of very poor quality. Returns are easy and swift for some items and for some, it is not very straightforward.Here's why I rated it 3 starsDelivery time ???????????????Almost all of my purchases arrive within the early part of the window provided.Product description ??????Often, the title is bigger than the description. For example,  I recently bought earbuds which I never knew could be sold in singles. Nowhere in the description, does it say it is a single bud. Customer service ?????????Further to my previous example, the customer agent argued that the description didn't say pair, so I should have assumed that it was a single earbud. Perhaps overworking made him forget that most humans now have two ears. Product quality: ????????????In my experience, around ten per cent of the items I ordered are of poor quality. (around 7 out of 70 items on my recent purchase)Returns and Refunds: ?????????Some returns are hassle-free and quick, with an option of TEMU credit or the original payment method. But asking the customer to keep the damaged item, rather than accepting and disposing of properly isn't a great practice.  Furthermore, Asking customers to return the faulty or broken item in its original packaging is not always practical. I had to cancel one of the returns for this as the item fell apart after the second use and I had already recycled the packaging etc.Pushing sales and advertisements ???Very poor and quite annoying strategy for pushing sales. There was a game of spinning wheels and stuff for ""winning"" a certain amount and once it reached 95 per cent, you had to invite 3 people (who must make a purchase) for you to get that 5 per cent. Another annoying and almost irrelevant ""offer"" is that when you place an order, you receive a coupon to spend on the next order.  For example, you get ??50 off coupon but is split into 3 or 4 purchases, like ??10 off ??20, ??15 off ??40 and another ??15 off ??40. It seems to be a great deal until you realise that this coupon is valid for barely two days.  And the worst part is- even if you place the order within this window, the coupons aren't automatically applied. If TEMU improves on these, I think it wouldn't have the same fate as WISH.",3,28/12/2023

I think I speak for a lot of people when I say "" where have you been hiding all these years "" lol. Anyway, I honestly wanted to wish them and their company good faith that their success remains forever. Oh and I just bought 6 bottles of eau de toilette for men and omg, I'm gonna smell great for months, again for great prices. When I go on to purchase anything , I buy it in bulk, it's the only way.

I have now placed 7 orders with Temu. I have never paid for shipping and all parcels arrived in the uk within 8 days maximum. Their customer service is exemplary. They respond to contact immediately and refunded one item as soon as I posted it and refunded an item I ordered wrong size  and as it was low cost said to keep it. Extremely low priced items and many useful homewares. They helpfully provide very clear sizing on every item. I have a dress in very nice fabric for ??7 and shoes for ??4. I always check to see the customers photos below the item to ensure similarity. Very impressed so far. Just need to recognize these are low priced goods and not to expect designer end items. However in this throw away society this fits a need.,5,29/12/2023

Do yourself a favor and just order it from Amazon; at least you?€?ll get it delivered super soon; and Amazon CS is on another level.All the ?€?free stuff?€? is a trap, when you?€?re close to getting anything it slows down and you?€?re literally going to spend 80+ days trying to get things worth ??10?? Sad really, has potential but the cheap and bad quality along with slow returns/bad CS will be their downfall,I won?€?t be purchasing from them again.",1,29/12/2023
"Awful company, placed a first order. Received it on time, but not one item was what I ordered, obviously received someone else's order!Got in touch with them, and eventually got a refund.Placed a second order, and it was 10 days late, for 2which I received a ??5 credit (whereas a refund is promised on the Web site).Products received were poor quality, some don't even work. Too much hassle to return, which is probably what they hope for.Have uninstalled the app, absolute rubbish company selling rubbish products.",1,29/12/2023
"Absolutely love, Temu fast shipping good quality stuff at very reasonable prices, fast actions if something?€?s amiss they keep you updated on your purchases and delivery, I?€?m hooked and have recommended and will recommend Temu",5,29/12/2023
Saved so much money buying from here. Saved at least ??60 buying identical products for sale on Amazon. You can send stuff back free but never had to. Make to most of your introductory offer. And don?€?t expect miracles on clothing quality!,4,29/12/2023
"1st time of using Temu unfortunately I won't be using them again ordered 2 ladies dresses & a dress for my granddaughter should have been delivered August 31st by Evri went to the shop of my chosen delivery not there tried again today still not there! Contacted Temu who put me intouch with a chat who basically said if it gets returned then I will get a refund...but what if its been stolen? Thank god I only spent ??23.70 ...Edit recieved my parcel 12 days late but highly delighted with the quality of the dresses, they fit perfectly and good quality so thankyou Temu",4,29/12/2023
"I don?€?t have any complaints about Temu themselves or items I have purchased it is the company delivering them. Luckily I was in today when a parcel came today 10 minutes later and I wouldn?€?t have been, but the parcel itself was just flung onto my pathway, not hidden anywhere for anyone to pick up and steel. I am not always in for my deliveries as I work so this is making me think twice about ordering anything.",4,29/12/2023
"What a load of absolute cr** won't order anything else typical chinese rubbish most need return or get a refund get what you pay for!update,I no longer have a temu account and never want one again most stuff needs to go direct to the bin not worth returning at any cost!",1,29/12/2023
"Was very curious having received so many offers from this company with OMG amazing deals! too good to be true deals! so thought I'd take the plunge and place my 1st order! 1st Order received of 12 items! returned 3 items which was around 60% of the total cost as complete and utter rubbish! (being polite) all items could have been bought in any UK pound shop for cheaper. Was going to return all items. but seeing as I've got them now saves me a trip to my local ??1 shop!Total bill;??33,34Total so called savings of ??61.54!!! Really? (marketing gimmick)Returned ??18.44 (3 items)So 9 items = ??15. phone charging cables, phone charger few house cleaning items etc.Won't be buying any other items from Temu based on my first order. Now let's see if they actually refund my money??..will update later.",1,29/12/2023

"Can I give zero stars?  Somehow, DHL's careless driver misplaced my pacakge - 2 different orders but it seems as if both were shipped together.  I contacted Temu and was able to manually request a refund for ???16.  I contacted customer service for a package worth ???40.  They have refused to issue a refund.  3 calls to DHL customer service and they said Temu did not contact them to start an investigation.  However, Temu reps keeps telling me an investigation was done-in 48 hours and they can see that my package was delivered to me.  Then I'm being told a check my mailbox.  I live in a freaking apartment!  There's no mailbox but mail slots.  Like what the f*''""!!  Communication has been going on from August 21!!   I have now asked my friend to reorder my things to his place...I had to place an order to use credit on my account and after this, no more shopping there.  I advise anyone, when shopping with Temu, DO NOT select direct payment.  Use Klarnaor another payment service.Update: Now I get a copy and paste response about refunds in GERMAN.  LOL!  I live in the Netherlands - DUTCH.  The response doesn't even address my concern... exactly what they have been doing with their copy and paste email responses and chat responses.",1,29/12/2023
"This is what I received after contacting After Pay because Temu sent the incorrect order and has said no to any type of refund.So sorry to hear about your experience and thank you for bringing it to our attention. Our store partners have direct control over their return & refund policies. and in this instance once you have placed your order, the merchant does not accept refunds.",1,29/12/2023
"The low score I have given is not so much about the products, but the delivery.  The products were what I expected - low quality, but fine for what I needed.  Unfortunately, Temu use Evri as their UK carrier and all 3 packages that have been generated by my Temu orders have had delivery issues.  One has still not been received and seems to be 'missing in action'.  Because of this, it is unlikely that I will order again anytime soon.",2,29/12/2023

"After being tempted by the low low prices, I created an account and placed an order. Then came the cold calls, 4 times in one day at the most. Irritating but nothing I?€?ve never experienced after putting my contact details into a site. And then came an email from a credit company, informing me what happens when I apply for credit. The next day, I receive a text from a ?€?pay later?€? shopping app with a code to verify an account. Both my phone number and email were comprised, luckily I used a virtual card to pay otherwise I?€?d be losing money too. I deeply regret downloading the app and haven?€?t even received my order of what is no doubt going to be subpar products. I don?€?t recommend.EDIT : received the order and while I?€?m happy with my purchases, I?€?m still upset by the leak of my personal information, that was near immediate after my purchase was completed.",2,29/12/2023

My order got stolen because it wasn?€?t delivered properly and left outside when though I asked the delivery company to leave it at the back. I contacted Evri and they said to contact temu to get a replacement or refund. I then contacted temu with all the proof that my parcel was stolen and they said ?€? based on our investigation we are really sorry but we are unable to provide a reshipment or refund for your order from our end ?€?Like what does that even mean?? This company will not help you if your parcel gets lost or stolen,1,29/12/2023
"I have used TEMU for 5 months now and it is my go to app for just about everything possible now. I have bought clothes, games, medical supplies and just about every thing else you can imagine. It only takes about weeks for me to get my items. If there ever was a problem with my order, TEMU fixed it immediately. I love this company",5,29/12/2023
"Edit: After leaving a 1-star review below, Temu did reach out to me and rectified the problem. They refunded me for the missing item so I've updated my rating to 4-stars.Buyer beware: I placed multiple orders with Temu within a short period of time so they consolidated those different orders into one package. So far so good, but it turns out that one of the orders is missing from the package they delivered and they are refusing to refund because they say the package was delivered. Yes, the consolidated package was delivered but that specific order is missing from it. They don't seem to be able to understand that. Avoid them at all costs.",4,30/12/2023
I ordered three tops and they arrived fairly quickly but they were screwed up in a bundle to make them small. When I opened them the sizes varied (despite the same size ordered) and bizarrely for a t-shirt there was a seam down the back (which was irritating). The material was not very nice and seemed poor quality (you get what you pay for I guess). I was able to return the items but on the whole it was a poor experience. I will not use again as you cannot trust the quality. Edit: Temu tried to get my review removed stating that it wasn't genuine. Make of that what you will.,2,30/12/2023
"The clothes are of good quality and the prices are reasonable. They also sell household goods, toys, ornaments just about everything. The company run 2 games Farmland and Fishland as an incentive to spend more.The idea is when you grow crops or feed fish to 100% you get up to ??100 free in goods and credit. At first the numbers rise quickly until you get to 99%. You then need to either water the crops with 3000 drops of water or feed the fish with 3000 food. Which is near enough impossible as the water and food drops depend on how much you spend. The last 1% goes up .1 to 100 The mini games are a way of trying to get people to spend money by buying goods to earn water. The latest is a spin the wheel to get money paid into your account. When you spin the wheel you are awarded an enticement but to actually get the amount offered you have to invite more friends to join the app.Despite this customer service is really good.",4,30/12/2023
"If i could give zero star i would. I order from temu the 3rd time now.. first order was ok, quality product is not that high but is ok for the price i paid. Second parcel with a big order came in totally wrong order.they actually send me someone else order. 3rd order came in with missing items. Is a nightmare trying to get a refund. Keep saying their warehouse did send the items and thank you for understanding?!! So you have paid for something you did not receive. They will not give you a refund and ask you to be understanding... it is horrible experience..avoid at all cost!!!",1,30/12/2023
I ordered 11 items. I received 1 item. 10 items have not been delivered. NO REASON NO RESPONSE FROM TEMU. I was advised my order would be in 2 separate packages. I charged FRAUD with my bank. I received a credit back on my CC. I will not do business with this company again.,1,30/12/2023
Done about 6 orders but Evri as their U.K. courier lets them down but ??5 for late orders and a full refund if no tracking for 7 days has worked very well for me parcel shop seems best way for delivery if you can,5,30/12/2023
"I?€?m well aware that many of the 5* reviews for Temu are fake (they are pathetically obviously so) but as I only saw them after I placed my order, I was frankly not even expecting my parcel to turn up. Any organisation that fiddles the reviews probably ought to be shunned as a matter of principle and this may be my only order. However it did turn up, and my fears of everything in it being trashy were unfounded. I was pleasantly surprised.",5,30/12/2023
"Had a few things from temu ,excellent prices ,easy to order,easy returns , had to send an item back ( my fault I ordered wrong size ) got full refund.cant be bad.",5,30/12/2023
Thought I?€?d give the website a try after hearing lots of people talk about it. The only positive was really quick delivery. The message really is that you get what you pay for. Of the 10 items I got 8 were absolute tat. Glad I didn?€?t spend much. Will be deleting the app as I can?€?t deal with the constant bombardments of offers either.,2,30/12/2023
I ordered an Item of clothing from TEMU just to see what it was like. I am truly astonished - a beautiful dress and jacket which arrived ahead of the given a date. Well made outfit costing just ??12.99 and I usually wear high end clothing! The tracking from start to finish was amazing so I will be ordering again.,5,30/12/2023
"They sell cheap poor quality chinese goods, and the packaging is laughable compared to Amazon's (usually a thin plastic bag with everything thrown in together).I have looked hard, I can't find even ONE single negative review on their site, which implies that the reviews are entirely fraudulent and I completely ignore them. I would imagine Trading Standards are already investigating this and other aspects of this business.I treat it as a bit of fun buying from them (like a chainsaw attachment I bought for an angle grinder - fun but very unsafe) but I never spend much time or money here. Prepare to be disappointed some of the time with the quality and functionality. Double check sizes of items, some things are TINY (like magnets I bought - 2mm wide)Considering they ship from China the last order I made only took a week, which is positive. But in my experience it's cheap tat, so lower your expectations and be prepared to smile.",2,30/12/2023
Was very wary ordering but have now had 2 deliveries. 5-6 day?€?s delivery time. All good excellent standard,5,30/12/2023

"MarieI would not recommend and advise people to be very careful with their personal details/ Bank details.This was my experience shopping from TEMU!I was alarmed to discover that after all that I was never going to receive my order due to fraudulent activities on my account. Tried to contact EVRI  no possible due to tracking number being incorrect/not recognised. I have had new requests to pay a fee for redelivery, but, to be honest I have given up and lost my money and will never be refunded as my tracking number is not helping at all!",1,30/12/2023

"I brought two clothing items a dress and wide trousers, when I received them they weren?€?t the best of quality and were far to large. I sent them both back and expected a refund to the original payment method but instead they have credited it back as a Temu credit. I don?€?t wish to use them anymore and want my money back. Online Customer  service were no good at all, I kept having to repeat myself. In the end they just apologised and said the credit could not be changed so my money is locked in as a Temu credit.

Out of the 5 items that I ordered, I was not pleased and satisfied with the quality and its working mode of 2 items.I put in a return and promptly, the return was accepted with return label sent to me via my app and email. I posted the items via courier to their warehouse based in the UK.The difference of my money was credited to my account the same day the goods was received. I was indeed impressed by the company policy of returns and refunds. One should understand that the return of goods must be intact and  in their original packaging together with any instructions enclosed. My advice is not to damage any packaging until you are certain that, you are keeping the goods. Bravo",5,31/12/2023
"Absolutely atrocious.Having issues with 2 packages not arriving. Contact them. Get told they can't do anything. Find out from AFCA that temu being the merchant must make claim through courier.Temu refuse.Since asking them to do their job, I've been rung AT LEAST 50 times on a private number by someone claiming to be a manager THREATENING MY LIFE if I didn't remove negative reviews.I know for a 110% guarantee it IS temu doing it, as, I get calls everytime I finish with their online live chat.I'm still going through the process of refund and temu are being very dismissive of every legal thing they have to do.I will be going to the police and lawyers to find out my next move. Especially with the threats.I also know the company will comment on this trying to claim its a fake review. They will also probably try claiming noone has been calling me but recordings don't lie.They have also sold my personal information to other off shore companies to the point I've had to change EVERYTHING (kept mobile number because there's nothing they can do except constantly call me and threaten my life for not removing negative reviews)Ongoing issues since 17th August 2023.ReplyAbsolutely ridiculous. Still they are being very dismissive and working illegally. I have spoken to AFCA further and a lawyer. Neither are happy that Temu can't follow simple instructions given to them. AFCA will also be looking at full permanent removal of Temu within Australia due to the illegality of the temus workings",1,31/12/2023

Entire order never received because evri showed proof it was left outside my house for any one to take then that's enough proof for temu to accept its been delivered and refused to refund me for orders I never received rather than chasing evri to claim back the money as they was at fault really for leaving my parcel outside.to be taken and me at a loss..  but same story from temu its policy's as its been showed evri dumped it outside rather than re deliver when someone was home!!! Shocking customer service... and when asked to speak to a manager they don't have any contact details for me to speak to a manager no email for them and no phone number. Joke!!!

"While I understand the appeal of the affordably priced items, discounts, and free shipping, it is not worth the headache. I ordered several items three weeks ago and have yet to receive my order. The vendor they contracted with to deliver items (one of which I have never heard of before ordering with Temu) Hailify, was both unprofessional and unreliable. There was a claim that they attempted to deliver the items which they did not, then continued to promise it would arrive within a week, then 2 days, a day, still no items. When I last called to inquire about status, they could not tell me why I had not received my items, or when I should expect them, then proceeded to tell me I should just get a refund and hung up.While some may say that this not Temu's fault, if a company continues to contract with vendors that are not reliable (I later investigated and saw the same complaints over and over again) then they do not value their customers. This was my first and last shopping experience with Temu. I much rather spend a couple of extra dollars on items to ensure I actually receive my items with more reliable vendors.",1,01/01/2024

I've received 3 orders and have one more on the way. Postage to UK has been 5-6 days and most of the stuff has been as expected. Sewing & craft products have been great. Some plastic products including one tiered storage trolley have been flimsy but returns are easy and free of charge. Packaging is the only poor part of the experience. They send products jammed together in one plastic bag and although they refund the occasional breakages promptly it is disappointing that some things arrive needlessly damaged.,4,01/01/2024
I have finally received  a response from Temu after Trust pilot intervention. Was disappointed no apology offered.  They did not send the return label as requested but decided  I should keep the   items I anted to return  and they have offered the refund.   This I  now know is beause of my review  and what a shame  they could have avoided such a bad image. I wint be able to trust them again.,1,02/01/2024

"TEMU should have a warning on their web site stating that ONE visit is NEVER enough and addiction to this site is enevitable...at least it is for ME :) I am so happy that I found TEMU, because they are so awesome that I find myself visiting their website 2 or 4 times a day! Ever since becoming an avid customer of TEMU I have stopped visiting Wish.com, because I am getting a better service from TEMU than I ever did from Wish with added beauty of the postage is so much faster! Not only is this company FILLED with awesome BARGINS, but they respect you and are extremely helpful & understanding when things go wrong. I tell everyone around me about TEMU, and I highly recommend them. Am not good with 'apps' so I search their web site for goodies and then I order on my computer. Thank You to TEMU for being such an AWESOME company. You will always have me as a loyal customer.",5,02/01/2024

I guess it is all down to the old maxim of you get what you pay for. Temu's prices are very low but sadly so is the quality. I bought a pair of sunglasses. They lasted exactly one day before the frane broke and the lenses fell out. I won't be returning to this website again,2,02/01/2024

UNACCEPTABLE as Temy gives false information to attract more customers!02.09.2023- I have contacted Temu customer service as soon as there was an issue and provided pictures of screenshot of product that I bought which has dropped in price and was not allowed to claim a price adjustment.

"I appreciate the reviews from my fellow reviewers regarding how good Temu is, however until today was under the same impression.  I have used lots of different online shopping platforms but the quality of the product and to add on to the total non coorditating customer service that gave me such a hard time made me change my thinking. To get a refund of the item which was returned  in the exact same state as it had arrived, i was given the reason to not get my refund was their quality control dis approved the item to be able to refund. I was totally baffled how can their quality control say this when the item was returned in the exact same state as they had sent.  This clearly concludes that Temu has no cross checking on how these decisions are made. On taking this up with the online helpdesk, they firstly refused, but then eventually after a lot of arguments, they finally agreed. However, long story short, Temu cannot be a reliable shopping platform if you are the one who are honest and genuine and expect the same from these retailers.",1,03/01/2024

"I was apprehensive but I decided to give this website a try. You are always weary of websites when they're based abroad and you can't talk to anyone directly if there's an issue. I wanted to save some money because it's quite tight atm and I had to buy stuff for a relatives new flat. I found the exact same items on Amazon, Argos and Ebay for a fraction of the price on Temu. I paid for the ??9 UPS express delivery as my first order was a ??180. Everything arrived in due time. The tracking is brilliant because you can see exactly where your packages are or where they have landed and departed. My packages were better travelled than me! Lol They fly from China, to East Asia and then to India and then to Germany before heading to the UK.The items arrived and I wasn't disappointed. Everything was perfect and as described and all 32 items were packed. I've ordered several times from this website since then. Their Web chat customer services isn't bad either. My past orders have been with express delivery. I'm now ordering a few bits with free delivery so I'm interested to see how that will be. So far I can't complain. It's like missing out the middle man and saving loads of money. That ??180 order..I calculated ??110- ??155 saving, depending on where you would purchase these items in the UK. The same identical items!!! If you're not in a hurry... Buy from Temu. I think the express delivery is brilliant and it makes the bulk order worth while. Let's be honest? Nearly everything is made in China and shipped over to the UK. You're just cutting out everyone who handles, distributes and sells the item in the UK. Basically buying straight from China. It makes sense and a smart saving.",5,03/01/2024
"Absolute joke of a company, ordered a tin sign from them and some Absolute idiot folded the sign in half to fit the packaging rendering the item as useless??? When I complained they gave me a refund but refused to send me a replacement, this was supposed to be a gift, couldn't give them the bent and twisted sign. They think it is just about the money, what about the customer service?",1,03/01/2024
"You know the saying, ""You get what you pay for."" Well those low priced shirts for me are made out of acrylic and polyester. No tags on how to clean them so I brought all six to the cleaners. They couldn't believe what materials they had seen. Is this the 1970s again? They are hot and do not breath like cotton blend. The three pairs of shoes fall apart quickly on the bottom because they are not rubber but rather foam soles. Single stitching so they will come apart after some uses. Just buy local so you can return your item if there's a problem.",3,03/01/2024
Do not use this company! I had the app on my phone for a while but hadn't placed any orders. I recently made a small order of around ??5 and shortly after my card details were stolen and used for several online transactions and I have had ??120 stolen from me. In this one instance you should believe what you see on the internet. They are most definitely selling people's details to the black market!,1,04/01/2024
"I used to use AliExpress, but thought I would give Temu a shot because of their free shipping. Have found everything to be of great value and quality. The shipping is surprisingly fast to New Zealand. I had one problem with a product and it was replaced immediately, no problem. I recommend this site.",5,04/01/2024
"Have bought a couple times from Temu, very cheap and reasonable quality. They have an easy and great refund system of product is not what you wanted. No complaints, was skeptical at first but now a regular customer.",5,04/01/2024
Fantastic quality for the price all exactly as ordered and processed a refund rapidly too. Not much more to say really!,5,04/01/2024
"I've made three purchases so far and am happy with it. Only one toilet brush holder cracked, but I hung the broken side against the wall. I've got another purchase on the way. It is nice that they have a choice of products you can't find anywhere else.",5,04/01/2024
Another online shopping app with really good pictures and insanely poor quality products. Crazy how I spent over ??100 on this. Never again!,1,04/01/2024
I have been buying the cheaper items with the idea of trying the more expence items. However I bought a bird scarer which was supposed to be water resistant but when it stoped working I found it was full fo water. To be fair this might be a one of. this will not stop me using Temu again. Their delivery  and packaging was very good. as the item was quite cheap I have not connected temu.Bill,4,04/01/2024
A marvellously beautiful website straightforward big choices great customer service highly recommend,5,04/01/2024
"I haven?€?t tested all the tools that came with this order but they look great. I was expecting a nightmare reading some of the reviews here but am excited to have everything I need for my craft projects. Delivered with care by Evri and arrived within time stated. I wonder if some people expect top range products for these bargain prices? I am replacing some high end tools and equipment that I gave away some years ago and don?€?t want to spend a fortune like I did previously. And these are at least mid quality or higher. Some, like the mini drill, jewellery findings and clay sculpture tools are exceptional quality. I never trust reviews entirely and Temu appear to have added far too many fake reviews here - looks like people were paid to write them. But people get paid to write negative reviews too by competing companies. So fortunately I?€?m someone who just takes a dive in at the deep end and gives things a go. I ordered a single item first time round and when that arrived in one piece I enjoyed a bigger order.A human response to this review rather than AI robot would have made me happier.",5,04/01/2024
"I was very, very skeptical about this Chinese site, as I've been very disappointed in the past. I've ordered quite a few things, and so far have been pleasantly surprised.  Amazingly good value for money, free shipping and quick delivery.  The fact they use Evri makes me err on the side of caution, ordering a few at a time, and will continue if the good service, and quality of items is maintained.",4,04/01/2024
"Very confusing web page (for Ladies shaver) resulted in duplicate order (or did it?). Ambiguous 'Order ' page. No way of talking with them, so will not find out until goods or credit card statement arrive.  .",1,04/01/2024

"Great experience! I ordered some stuff on Thursday, and I realised that in 3 days I am going on holiday, so, I requested to customer service using the app, if I can get this package faster, they were very supportive, and immediately received notification that the package is in course to be delivered. The package arrived  within 3 days, and the things I bought matched the pictures and the quality expected.Moreover, after I placed the order I checked some reviews, and I was a bit concerned, but to be honest this first experience with Temu exceeded my expectations - delivery, products and quality.",5,04/01/2024
"Had heard some poor reviews so tried a small order at first just as a test. All items came, one was partially missing something (set of 4 sand timers, only 3 arrived) but I raised a return and was refunded immediately without having to send the items back. I?€?ve since made a lot more orders and have had no problems. I would say the quality is always as expected or better, never less than expected (so long as you keep in mind that stuff is being sold cheaply and don?€?t expect top premium quality!).Evri lost one of the parcels (left on our doorstep when we weren?€?t home) and again this was refunded by Temu immediately with no issues. Have also checked my old orders regularly to pick up any of the refunds for items going on sale for cheaper than I?€?d paid.The games/free cash are almost impossible unless you know people who haven?€?t already downloaded the app, but I did manage to get ??30 free credit and a ??90 off ??200 voucher, so both were used on quite a large order!",4,05/01/2024
"Order a product online on 18 Aug'23 with estimated delivery time of 24-29 Aug'23, the order was never delivered and when contacted the customer services team all they could do is to either reship or refund as they could not trace the delivery packet. There is no point in ordering from TEMU if you have to wait for almost 2-3 sometimes 4 weeks before it can be delivered why TEMU cannot give us an exact/approximate delivery time at the time of ordering a product which is realistic. why customer has to keep tracking/chasing where my order is?It is better if i oreder from Amazon or Shein, atleast they always deliver on time and have a better customer services than TEMU.Never going to order again. pointless to waste time on tracking the order after paying for it and then contacting customer services for a refund when order is not delivered. TEMU has to work a lot in terms of Logistics and parcel delivery and make sure sellers are genuine and sending the product in timely manner and not just updating/auto",1,05/01/2024
I am about to receive my second delivery from Temu.What really impresses me is that you are kept informed about delivery every step of its journey.Thank you Temu,5,05/01/2024
"Awesome deals and excellent customer service, decent products and great selection! I am very happy with everything though shipping speed has room for improvement.",5,05/01/2024
Just received my first 2 orders total 20 items so please with them all 2 kids t shirts 2 small went on return immediate answer and credited my account and told me to keep t shirts the only advice I would give is use a third party to pay I use Clearpay so you don?€?t hand bank details over I do this with all web sites,5,05/01/2024
Very dishonest and underhanded practices.Kastking have confirmed they do not have a shop on temu. It's a pirated shop.,1,05/01/2024
"Absolutely love temu , everything I have bought has been of good quality and such affordable prices makes me want to shop more ,have already bought loads of Christmas presents from them ,miles better then wish and the delivery is quick as well ,will be shopping on here for years to come.Also the customer service is excellent and really helpful.",5,05/01/2024
"First and last time buying. Temu set up direct debit via pre-approved payments on PayPal, which I did not authorise nor was i alerted to by paypal. Scam artists.",1,05/01/2024
"Cheap items free shippinghad purchased a few items while most were great, a few were damaged or not fit for use upon contacting them they allowed a full refund on the spot which was paid out a few days later. will def come back again.",5,05/01/2024
I?€?ve never had any problems ordering from Temu sometimes it?€?s a little bit late but they always give me $5 off for it being late and it?€?s put back on my debit card and when I call them and tell them I didn?€?t get my order they always send me a new order and if the order i placed comes i get to keep both orders i have ordered clothes flash lights rugs makeup sheets blankets phone cases it?€?s just a wonderful place to shop I hope they stay in business,5,05/01/2024
"They use Evri to deliver; that alone should be enough warning not to order from them. You also get bombarded with messages trying to tempt you to buy more. Never again, I've closed my account and deleted the app for security.EDIT: Temu are now making every effort to have my post removed, by forcing Trustpilot to verify my orders by quoting order numbers. As I already said in my post, I've closed my Temu account and deleted their app, so cannot quote those details. I wonder whether positive reviewers are ever asked for verification; I very much doubt it!",1,05/01/2024
"Don't trust the delivery times they quote, I have been quoted specific delivery dates and times and have arranged my day around the deliveries only to find out I have completely wasted my time, although I realize it's in the hands of the courier company it's up to TEMU to use couriers that are reliable and in the UK that does not seem to be the case this has happened more than once, and all TEMU do is give generic replies or are reading from a crib sheet, I don't care about the fiver they offer for late delivery I just don't want to waste my time waiting in for deliveries that don't happen, I have cancelled appointments to wait for them, I would advise them to use a more reliable courier company, I am very seriously thinking about closing my TEMU account. And I am not the the only person that has had problems I have spoken to others that have had the same problems some of them have already closed their accounts.",1,05/01/2024

On the whole a positive experience and for the prices paid I really expected it all to be rubbish. It was a trial buy. More than half the items were nice. The toiletries/make up bag I didn?€?t like it will go to charity box. Not nice like it shows. The tooth whitening paste doesn?€?t work at all and is hardly even a purple colour. The mini jewellery box is perfect for travel except mine was dented at the top. I will fix it or put something on the top to hide the dent. Only ??2 so what can you expect! The jewellery is really nice. Only gold plated and glass stones but really pretty and looks much nicer than the ??1.50 I paid. Got two rings. Earrings also nice and make up brushes look good and soft. Lots of variety of size and shape. Finally the fine tip pens are really good value for 12 pens at ??2! Real bargains but need to chose wisely. Enjoy.,3,05/01/2024
"I have become hooked on Temu recently. They have some lovely items. The majority of which are really good quality. So far there have been no quibbles when i have wanted to return anything and on occasion they have refunded me and let me keep the item. Overall low cost, quality items that have all arrived on time with no issues. I would recommend",4,05/01/2024
Amazing!!!! Fantastic!!! Excellent Service !!!,5,05/01/2024
"First impression it is a company like Shein from China. Only used it once so far. Ordered quite a lot and they came into two separate parcels in different dates. I would say most items are okay but it's super cheap, compare with the price in UK. Easy to order online. Similar delivery time to Shein. So far so good.",4,05/01/2024
"I have bought many things from Temu and have been quite satisfied with the items. Most of the items take 2 weeks to reach destination.  The only issue that I have had is with Ontrack shipping service.  Most items are flown to NY then shipped by USPS or by Ontrack, my Most recent purchase went to MA, then to OH, then to NJ, now back to OH where it belongs. Getting hold of them is impossible if your searching for a real person.",5,05/01/2024
"As Aliexpress lover i ws worried to try something new. Temu is much better then aliexpress. Chepaer as without tax, faster ( most orders coming within 7-10 days ).

"Spent hundreds of dollars on TEMU, shoes are never the correct size, & I have problems almost every order. Customer service is helpful at least, & returns are usually quick/easy through UPS. I even told friends/family/Tik Tok followers about how much I love their press on nails, random household accessories, kids/adult clothing & prices. I gave it a 2 star rating due to my recent inconveniences. They have a HORRIBLE delivery vendor UniUni, workers don?€?t attempt to deliver & your packages end up being sent back to TEMU. Today, another vendor they use PiggyShip left my package in the lobby area of my apartment & it was stolen. The delivery workers are literally lazy & lack common sense which makes the customer experience bad. I?€?ll no longer be shopping on this website thanks to these bad delivery experiences.",2,06/01/2024
Temu is a very good shopping site which is from China it brings fast delivery and mainly uses Evri (UK) sometimes you get cheapy bits but that's rare it's like anything really but most the time it's good quality and when needing support Temu resolves it straight away with their live chat team and they're very polite.,5,06/01/2024
Items are cheap but of good quality. Orders take up to a week to arrive but worth the wait and if it is late there is a ??5 credit added to your account. This works. Has done twice for me!,5,06/01/2024
Amazing products and came in a reasonable time lovely,5,06/01/2024
Used a couple of times now and on my second purchase ordered over one hundred pounds worth of goods which included various bits and pieces. as i wanted to see if anything was worth purchasing the odd piece here! I got what I expected and that is extremely low quality goods at really cheap prices so if your happy to receive low quality goods than this sites for you. personally I would much rather pay more and receive something I'm happy with as a posed to pay cheap get low quality goods.The trouble is some goods look the part but even steal products can be made of inferior steal like tools and electronic bits made to Chinese standards not European or British which can be  dangerous. I'm a builder by trade so know what I'm talking about here you really get what you pay for so be wary!.I have just updated my comment and stand by most of it and what I think was slightly unfair was removed. my comment is about the quality of the goods on offer on Temu not Temu's professional conduct as they have done nothing wrong they were true to their word and delivered as promised and even honoured the cash back they state on their site if late. some of the goods are OK but allot were very cheap and not worth purchasing. i hope they get choosy with who sells goods on their site as that is the only way you get to be trusted and China stated it was going to stop producing cheap inferior goods but I have yet to see that happen!.  as I said some goods are worth the try but my advise is be very choosy,1,06/01/2024
"Absolutely a mess , it?€?s a waste of money and time ?€?.I ordered for 100 quid an relied on the reviews had here and on temu but seems like all are fake reviews!The items ordered as quality is bad and doesn?€?t worth even 10 quid , cheap plastic , cheap items and doesn?€?t fit ! And on top of that they actually send me wrong ones I do not recommend and don?€?t look at the reviews because this ares done by the gpt?€?s to look as they came from a British person ( even the names are quite funny ) Don?€?t order !

"I have ordered several times from Temu and other than slow delivery had no problems. My last order has caused me to rethink my feelings. Until now my orders have actually been delivered by USPS. The current order is now showing that it will be delivered by Lasership. In my experience, Lasership is a lying,  nonresponsive company. If Temu is using them it indicates to be that they are not interested in doing anything to speed the delivery process and I now question whether they are actually just another Chinese rip-off company.",1,06/01/2024

"Like many others I was sceptical of the validity of this company, considering it offered a vast array of products at such extremely low prices. I tried a small order of metal cutting dies - and was amazed at both the speed of delivery and the quality of the dies. Since then I have put in a couple more orders for dies - all excellent - and have graduated to a couple of t shirts and costume jewellery which I'm waiting for. I can see how this site can become addictive, but a warning....you have to buy selectively as you do get what you pay for!",4,06/01/2024

"So far I have made about 7 separate purchases and in each of them about 5-6 items. So there are quite a few things that, by now, have arrived and have also been used. My initial reaction was that it was too good to be true. However, there were only 2 items where I was not happy with and that were below par. I did report them to the company and in both cases they allowed me to keep them rather than trying to send them back. They also credited my account with the amount of those items.As for the quality, I cannot fault them. If you read the description, of what you want to buy, properly then there will be no surprises or disappointments. So all in all, great items to be had at even better prices and no problems with the company.I will carry on buying from them and hopefully save even more money. ++++++++",5,07/01/2024

I sent them the letter that has hidden watermarks in it so it cant be faked, So I hired a Attorney and Friday we filed two suits, One was for small claims.

"False and manipulative advertising! Temu appeared as an Ad in my facebook feed and I clicked on an item I liked to check it out and a spin the wheel appeared with many attractive prizes.

While trying to find it another pop up appeared this time IN the app and I supposedly won ???27 also not as initially shown. I contacted support with screenshots and description of events. They tried to use the excuse that this offer is not available in my region to which I replied it shouldn?€?t be advertised in my region then. Then they tried to tell me I didn?€?t download and sign up through proper channels which just shows how manipulative their ad was. They tried to avoid me giving this review by starting to offer small discounts with a cap while saying this was a gesture from them not even once accepting at least that this was a mistake and it will be fixed. Untrustworthy, consumer manipulative and disrespectful. I regret downloading and giving them my e-mail! This is the first time I review a business negatively because I tried to give them feedback privately and all I saw felt was them not caring about the tricky advertising which can influence a potential customer m, they only care about getting him on board any way they can.",1,08/01/2024

I don't play the online games other reviews reference and I haven't been paid for this review!!! I'm in the UK and delivery usually takes exactly a week. I price check what I'm buying and, generally, save between 40 and 70% per item. Things like socks are a lot cheaper on Temu. The clothes, I woudn't buy from here because they are that shiny fabric.

I had to delete this app as I was getting so many ads and I'm talking hundreds everyday mostly from scam websites. Temu say that your information isn't shared but I totally disagree. Since deleting I have hardly any ads which not a coincidence. It's like night and day now.I received an email from Trustpilot this morning saying Temu wanted my details and since then I have those unwanted ads back. I reported one to Google because it was a well known German supermarket but was being advertised by a Hong Kong company that is behind many scam websites. Here I go again!!!!! The reply from Temu says it all. No mention of NOT sharing information with 3rd parties or any denial again says it all. This to me is a BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH reply. I'm speechless.,1,08/01/2024
First time customer and I received everything I ordered within a week . Really pleased with everything including a wide legged jumpsuit that due to their first time user promotion was less than ??2 ! I'm happy with the quality of everything I received . 100% will be shopping there again,5,08/01/2024
"DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM TEMU , THE HEADQUARTERS ARE IN BOSTON LAZY PEOPLE, THIS IS 100% THE TRUTH.THE ANSWER FROM TEMU IS FROM A  BOT. THIS IS NOT REAL ANSWER!!!! And they can't even deliver packages properly, things go wrong 4 times, what a worthless company, and the customer service in USA is very lazy!!  they don't do anything and they don't solve any problems!!!!  People, I keep saying, never buy from TEMU, buy from Aliexpress, I've never had a problem with that.",1,08/01/2024
"So I never got my stuff. At first I was just disappointed and thought no biggie. Then my neighbor had a Temu order delivered while I was there so I shared my experience. She said no worries, just let them know. So I didn't. They refunded my money and I went back to shopping. It was great!!",5,08/01/2024
"Have ordered a lot of items now and even won over ??80 worth of goods free through some of their in app games.A couple of items weren't up to the quality we expected, but they refunded us straight away. Very good service",5,08/01/2024
Just received my first order from Temu. I ordered a mop and bucket set. At the time when I placed my order the mop and bucket set with 2 mop cloths cost ??1.98 and to order 10 more mop cloths the price went up to ??7.18  I ordered 10 mop cloths with the mop and bucket set and I only got sent the 10 mop cloths with no mop and no bucket. Just checked their website and noticed that they have now changed pricing to ??12.98 for mop and bucket. If the mop and bucket set were not included with the 10 mop cloths  set they should have clearly said so. Only showing photos is not good enough. They could have said mop and bucket set not included or mop and bucket set sold separately or 10 mop cloths only. It is such a shame as there were other stuff on their website which I would have eventually purchased had I not had this first bad experience with my first order. I am not saying that they are a scam as I know of people who did get what they ordered. Temu  needs to take more care with displaying their goods on line for sale so that people know exactly what they are purchasing 7 September 2023 updateI have shared my details with Trustpilot to prove that I am a real genuine customer. I have asked them to share it with Temu. I am willing to communicate with Temu.,1,08/01/2024
I gave them 5 referrals they never gave me any thing for it second time I gave them 3 referrals and the keep on rejecting me so it's all fake and lies nothing real about this app disappointments,1,08/01/2024
A great company if you are disabled OAP .customer service treat you so well and have a fantastic policy on returns I bought item by mistake contacted them sorted Out and got immediately my purchase price for wrong item .have now bought the one I should have bought   Prices are fantastic and most goods are what it says on the label  don?€?t understand bad reviews I have done a lot of business with temu all to my satisfaction as I say customer service on disability I do wish other companies had the same standards as most treat you as some one to avoid and I am talking about large utility companies especially. keep up the great work with you treating people so well,5,08/01/2024
Thought it was too good to be true but it?€?s actually fantastic. Ordered a gym bag and some house things to test it out and very happy. Quicker delivery than Shein & Romwe and of similar quality but cheaper.,4,08/01/2024
"I have placed order from Temu site and selected delivery address to their pre-defined locker address.Now, they themselves are not getting the said address.Trying to reach Temu and EVRI customer care but useless no solution but to wait.",1,09/01/2024
Although I didn?€?t receive my order I do believe it was the couriers fault I tried contacting the number and it tells you go onto a website and totally useless courier service I requested a refund from TEMU and they were absolutely brilliant I had my full refund within a day or two they were very good I will definitely be shopping with them again hopefully this time they might use a better courier service,5,09/01/2024

"Temu...I ordered 510 'DOG POOP BAGS-STIRDY/SAFE/DEGRADABLE (??11.89 as orders over ??10 free postage). The worst quality of any plastic bag ever, not stirdy nor safe and I doubt very much if they are degradable!...the smell of POOP evaporates straight through these cheap nasty bags!I order amazing bags from other manufacturers and only wanted to see how Temu measured up...thumbs down zero out of ten and total waste of my money.Here with a reply to the reply from Temu regarding my feedback...I am very concerned about the source and your manufacturing of look alike products of inferior goods which I believe is across the board with  your products.  You are conning the public, hoping they don't return goods.  I am so disappointed that you can sell in the UK total bottom standard and unethical goods, bad for the enviroment and a total waste of space.Lynn",1,09/01/2024
"Absolutely 100% what I ordered, delivered on time, good communication and none of the follow up 'spam' mails others have suffered. I understand that with any company people have bad experiences, and this company is probably no different. But my experience was great, and the price was excellent value.",5,09/01/2024
"The order came earlier than expected, but I have since been inundated with pointless emails and so called promotions.",3,09/01/2024
Terrible product. I ordered a dress in my usual size. It was an awful shape and so tight across the chest that the buttons would not fasten. I will not order from here again.,1,09/01/2024
"UPDATE:After all these months I'm still waiting for the money Temu has stolen from me and their continual disregard for Federal laws and regulations. Temu needs to be SHUT DOWN until they respect our laws!!!!!I've constantly been lied to and provided false tracking information and customer service does absolutely nothing to resolve these issues. STAY AWAY!!!!! You might have to pay more on eBay or Amazon but you get your packages and valid tracking information. Again....STAY AWAY AND DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING TEMU SAYS!!!!UPDATE: Temu has now givin me 2 separate tracking numbers that were NEVER ISSUED by USPS and I have no way of knowing if my orders have even been shipped. AGAIN STAY AWAY FROM TEMU!!!!!!! UPDATE: I was online for over 7 hours trying to figure out if my package was even shipped or not and have Temu proof of a fake tracking number and they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP IN ANYWAY. Temu don't care about their customers and customer service agents do not listen and are NOT ALLOWED to help you plus you can't get a the department your told you need to talk to or even get a supervisor online. Once temu has your money they don't care about you anymore.UPDATE #2:Waiting on a package that has not left their warehouse in 3 days and placed on the 22nd...Temu says it's not their responsibility to get my package to me and they have no idea where it is to give me any additional information and I just have to wait to see if I get it.""No, customer since we don't have accurate answer. upon checking customer you just order last august 26, 2023 and we don't have the exact location where is your order. Please kindly wait for the item to be delivered to you on Sep 2, 2023 2:48 am EDT ~ Sep 7, 2023 2:48 am EDT"" This is the answer I got from customer service agent Felipe. Temu has no idea what happens with your packages after getting your money. STAY AWAY!!!!!!",1,09/01/2024
I cannot reach a real person. My account is frozen due to a supposed dispute that occurred due to fraud of my credit card. Not having anything to do with Temu. CC company has resolved all issues but Temu has not restored my account. I have tried live chat which is always a bot. I've submitted tickets and emails also answered by a bot. I cannot get this issue resolved. So frustrated!,1,09/01/2024

"I've ordered a few times now and was happy but this time my order was left on my doorstep and got evidence that it was stolen on my camera I've contacted temu and get same auto reply every time I've told them I haven't received my parcel as same name person everytime and exactly same reply tellin me it was delevered and to check neighbours and other places even tho I stated in my message u can see it's been stolen given evidence too and they won't do anything, so be careful, temu as tried to tell trust pilot my experience was real and tried to get my comment removed well I sent the receipt so try again",1,10/01/2024
First and last time ordering from Temu. Order was shipped and has been sat at Evri?€?s hub for two weeks. No update to shipping and the only way to chase is via the Temu app and click speed up delivery. This didn?€?t work and I?€?ve now had to request a refund as I know it won?€?t turn up. Disappointed as was looking forward to receiving the items I?€?d ordered!,1,10/01/2024
I?€?m not paid to comment I was abit worried about ordering so I ordered something small and cheap and surprisingly it was really good quality for what I paid for it and it came within the time frame and I have just put another order in,5,10/01/2024
"Very happy with the customer service!The 1st product i ordered was of a poor quality and i applied for refund which i received within 3 days without any issue!  The other 2 products were of a good quality and I was happy with my purchase. Moreover, when there was a mess up with Evri, the Temu customer service stepped in to support and coordinate the delivery. Now I trust this platform and will be ordering again. This is my sincere and trustworthy feedback! Nothing to compare with Aliexpress, scammers who deliver damaged and fake products with no refund!",5,10/01/2024
"I lost trust in Temu after ordering several times with great customer service and trouble free returns. I recently bought a few high licket items, returned them all and now Temu is telling me they didn't receive them. They were in the same box as the rest of the items I returned. I'm very upset that they won't do a refund nor a Temu credit. Please ppl just order cheap things, I don't want anyone else losing money. Also they ask you to return both orders in 1 box to reduce carbon...DON'T  DO IT!!!",1,10/01/2024
Thought this was going to be another wish how wrong I was first order came in days very unexpected ordered another item got from china to uk in2 days but evri took over a week to deliver to me got in touch with temu customer service who were extremely helpful will recommend on my facebook and show the quality of the products,4,10/01/2024
"Ordered several items and they are very cheap, but don?€?t be fooled - you get what you pay for. Customer service is just copy and paste statements - when you are quite obviously annoyed they say ?€?Great?€? hahahaha. The games and constant advertising and marketing  is trying to embed the company into peoples?€? subconscious (think McDonalds, Coca Cola, Amazon) - don?€?t fall for it. Some items are ok, but nothing is designed to last. I would not be surprised if the whole thing is not a data gathering campaign. The first items that they sent me they refunded when they broke, the second time they wanted them back even though I sent clear evidence that it was broken. What is the point? More landfill fodder and wasted energy from me and the fuel from the delivery/ collection driver. ????",1,10/01/2024
"Goods have arrived on time, and, they are as described. I have had three separate orders for  number of articles, so far so good. Great company to do business with.",5,10/01/2024
"I was a little hesitant initially ordering with Temu. However, I have had a fantastic experience; my orders came quickly, were as described, and the EVRI tracking was constantly updated. I highly recommend this company.",5,10/01/2024
"So let?€?s start with horror stories, yes I?€?ve heard lots of them stating the steal your details and spend your hard earned cash. Well I guess that could be true if you pay by card. Pay by Apple Pay, google pay or even klarna, don?€?t input your  personal card information, be safe, I?€?ve had so far good experiences with Temu, delivery usually takes approx a week but it?€?s coming from China, what do you expect? When it gets here everything you ordered is in the package and I?€?ve had no issues Editing my review as Temu has recently removed a review i made which was genuine, i had a severe reaction to alleged 925 sterling silver necklace, i posted a picture of me with my very sore neck stating this jewellery cannot be sterling silver as i wear it all the time and never until now have a i had a problem. The fact the seller asked for the review to be removed and temu sided with them regardless of my evidence is absolutely disgusting, so if you are going to take my review down i will post it on her, most of your stuff is okay but get your customer priorities correct. I was warning others of the dangers of your sellers jewellery. Trustpilot is a safe place for honest reviews, this review is more than honest, i like temu but i dont like your behaviour when something goes wrong.",3,10/01/2024

"The pictures are a hundred percent better than the real products. Most of the woman clothing I received were cheap see-through printed polyester, the household items are much cheaper and more flimsy than they appeared on the website. The ?€?big discount ?€? you are promised have a very narrow window (approximately 60 minutes) and most of the ?€?gifts?€? you are promised to get for free are blocked from clear view so it?€?s very difficult to choose. I believe the rating for all their products are fraudulent. Thought the prices appear cheap, you get rubbish for quality, and they make it very difficult/expensive to return. I went back to ordering from Amazon, they all came from china, but although more expensive, they arrived faster and easier to return.I will not even recommend Temu to the people I dislike!",1,11/01/2024
"On my third shop with Temu, absolutely love it! Deliveries have been earlier than I expected and great tracking information. Can't wait for my next haul to arrive and then place another order. Thank you Temu ??????",5,11/01/2024

"Before I start take note that Temu is a Chinese company, which says it all, The size 40 waist and longest leg jeans I bought from them went in the bin they were far too short, at halfway down my shin, what my family call Jeffro jeans, if you've ever seen The Beverly Hillbillies you'll know what i mean, however, i am 6' tall and they maybe would have fitted a very short fat midget, i could have returned them but decided to cut my losses, anyway lesson learnt,                                                 To be fare                                                 Revised review: if you read my previous review It seems I was mistaken about Temu being the source of malware I received, So sorry Temu it was just the timing that I received them that led me to falsely believe that you were the source, apologies,",1,11/01/2024

"Temu shows warehouse addresses in NY & CA, and states their products come from ?€?all over the world?€?, but I purchased 8 items and all had to come through customs, and every single item (clothing) had a ?€?made in China?€? tag. Clothing is just ok, cheap but priced cheaply. So everything is actually coming from China. Now I know. I asked and they gave a bot/AI answer- they won?€?t actually answer the question.",2,11/01/2024

I ordered twice from Temu and both times parcels arrived on time and I was kept updated re delivery. Items I bought are fantastic. All of them! Cats litter trap mats are the best. Cheap and excellent quality. LED solar garden light still works perfectly for 1 month now and after super heavy rains and wind. I will buy again from TEMU for sure.,5,11/01/2024
"I returned 3 sweaters, one came back denied bec/I selected the wrong return category. Which is not listed for a denial reason in the return policy. When I contacted Temu I got an email that it ""was not received"". 2 different excuses. This is the 4th time I have gotten the answer it was not received. I'm just going to say it either their warehouse workers are shady or Temu is actively ripping people off by denying honest returns when the product was returned in good faith. I really want this investigated so other shoppers do not have to fight like me to get a refund for a product you returned and no longer have. I will not shop here anymore there is always SheinUpdate: Just like the other 3 times I got an email Temu wants to better understand my experience and asked for order #, I put it in the original complaint where it asks for it, just a stalling tactic",1,11/01/2024
the items i?€?ve received so far are really good all plus clothing . the problem is receiving them Evri are a nightmare and can?€?t get to speak to anyone . if you speak to temu they just tell you their will give you a ??5 credit if it?€?s late . one order i have placed has not moved in 3 days so still in China . shame as i do like the goods they sell,3,11/01/2024
"If I could leave negative stars I would. The items received were nothing like the pictures, total junk, and trying to return is a joke. Contacted the company who took days to respond and only offered a 20% off my next order, did nothing to resolve the issue and help me return the unwanted items   (Which was all of them). Doing a reversal of charges with my bank.",1,11/01/2024
"I am an artist & illustrator and have found my designs being sold on Temu without my permission. The same seller is also selling other stolen designs from other artists. I have contacted Temu about the copyright infringement and they say they take these things seriously and will remove, however, they have yet to do so. This site is full of designs sold without artists permission, its not just the one seller. There is a reason why items are so cheap through Temu!***UPDATE*** Temu have now taken down the items that breached my copyright, however according to their policy they will take down any traders that are repeat offenders, this they have not done. This seller has had work by other artists taken down and is still selling stolen goods. They are shipped by Temu, therefore Temu are still dealing in stolen goods.",1,12/01/2024

It's legit and I have yet to have security issues while using my bank card. Every order arrived quick and everything I've bought so far arrived in good condition. I have seen other reviews complain about delivery issues, but I have yet to experience that myself.The only thing that I don't like about Temu is that they sell items that are not reliable at all, which makes sense since they are cheap. I'm not sure if I trust reviews on their website because some of them show red flags to me. Besides that, I recommend looking into Temu. They do have stuff on there that I believe is worth purchasing.",4,12/01/2024
"My first time using Temu. They allow you to win gifts around ??100+ in vouchers which gives you the idea you?€?re already on for a winner. I?€?d spent ??149 and was charged around ??50 with delivery included  for my items. Whilst the vouchers are really just a gimmick to make you think you?€?ve won when really you?€?re just paying the value of the items. I?€?d spent enough so that if it was as bad as people made out I wouldn?€?t miss what id spent if any issues came about but really my first order was great, no issues, it came within the time frame they stated and 10 out of the 12 items were as pictured or described, two items were terrible. But items that have reviews with images and shops that have a good reputation of reviews but otherwise avoid. I can?€?t say much for their return policy as I was happy with my overall purchase.",4,12/01/2024

Second order was storage boxes got some bags said quilt on but imagine meant to cover a suit or something! Same thing refunded but it?€?s not our policy NOT to ask you to return but we?€?ve refunded what! Take heed DO BOT order crap as you won?€?t get what you ordered from China. Refund was not requested but the goods I ordered to be sent but the reply was clear here?€?s a ??5 towards the order. Two orders never again.

"My account didn't have a 15 dollar threshold on it when I started it. They out of the blue added it today while I was getting a few cheap items! I asked to remove it because my friend said they did that. The filed a ticket and the horrible, scumbag agent basically made up some nonsense excuse about needing that threshold and demanded I buy up to 15 dollars worth of stuff. I don't go to temu for that, no other shopping site does this! Not even shein or wish! They have yet to fix this so I am leaving this review. The fact they made it 15 is especially evil, the dang near 20 bucks of stuff! And what happens if someone buys one 15 dollar item? That's fine? That's one item, but I have to buy a bunch of stuff when I only need a few pins. Temu come on!Oh and this was done right when I discovered a gift I had place for my friend was never even shipped out and got lost. So they've lost an order I placed and then had the weak spine to place a 15 dollar threshold on my account. I like temu, but this is such a scummy business practice. No other shopping site has a threshold, especially one that's basically aliexpress with faster shipping. So until this bs threshold is removed, I will be blasting the business!",1,12/01/2024

"Alright, so I've bought from temu about 5-6 times with one more order on the way. So far 75% of the time my items have been late (or VERY late), but I don't care as long as it arrives. I can find no big flaws with temu yet. The only real issues I've had are with my own expectations. A couple times I've expected a piece of clothing to have a different fabric just from how it looks in the pics. But I've quickly learned to check what the listing itself says the fabric is, and if it doesn't say, it's probably gonna be junky. So you either gotta pay attention to the listing details, or take a gamble. I absolutely LOVE that it shows me sizing from my country (meaning they convert the sizing for me, no guessing or hoping). Even amazon doesn't do that! Overall, I'm super happy with my purchases from temu, and sometimes downright impressed. I honestly could never afford anything nice if not for this site",5,12/01/2024

I?€?m not interested in the ??5 refund. Just wanted my items before I go on holiday .",3,12/01/2024
2 orders both not delivered. They said they had a signature and both parcels had been delivered. I asked where the parcels were delivered to and who signed for them ( it wasn?€?t at our address as I have security cameras) they said they couldn?€?t tell me. Looked up the courier they are using and it looks like a scam.  They won?€?t give me a refund even though I?€?ve not had the goods as they are saying they have been delivered. It?€?s a complete scam.

They keep you informed of your order status, they have a no quibble returns structure and when I?€?ve needed to return for a refund, it was issues immediately and was in my bank account within a couple of days. The prices are very good and what I?€?ve found so far that on the website, they give you full details of each product and if necessary, how to assemble it making it very clear of what you are buying. I definitely recommend.",5,13/01/2024
Order arrived finally company ok but Evri let them down. Items were good.I changed from one star to two. I think the problem with this company is Evri as a courier.,4,13/01/2024

"The products are cheap and of course not the best quality but I applaud them on their service, they keep you informed with tracking. This is the best company for service and a lot of companies could follow their example. You can order in the knowledge you will get the goods. I will continue to use them and recommend them. Yes this is a genuine feedback. Fox/Westbury/UK What I don't understand is how they can sell things so cheaply and also postage is included.",4,13/01/2024

"So I was on the fence ordering from Temu, however 3 orders in and I'm pretty still so so about them. Some items have been fab,some not so. Cheap quality of material used, items not like what you see on the website so make sure you see other people reviews, pictures and go a size up. Delivery is quick,returns easy, refunds 7-10 days before the money back in your account. Will I stay with Temu, I doubt it, but okish for silly Xmas birthday gifts..",4,13/01/2024
This is a complete SCAMOrdered a Toolbox received a small cheap necklace After weeks of emails they are now being bounced back as not contactable. The old saying ?€?if it looks to good to be true it normally is ?€?As in this case a complete ripoffMichael Harvey,1,13/01/2024
I used a third party app to make a purchase and they insist that the best coupon was applied but it was not. So I cancelled and reordered with proper coupon and accidentally got credit instead of the third party so now I have $70 credit that I do not want sitting on this account that I?€?m paying for WITH INTEREST. I will not longer use them the quality is 50/50 but it?€?s become clear they are very predatory. I?€?ve tried talking to them multiple times and they give me the runaround. The way they address it makes it obvious they can do something and won?€?t. I don?€?t recommend anyone use this app ever. No promo they offer is worth it. I do not recommend to anyone anymore. At first it seemed worth it for certain types of items but nothing on there is worth this headache and an extra $40 interest when I?€?m already out $70 to them because they refuse to return the difference to the third party they keep trying to tell me they can?€?t give me cash back so instead I literally have a loan out for nothing for it to just sit on my account t with them unused. All around terrible experience this time. Not worth it for some cheap products from China most of the time with. So now I?€?m out over $100 unless I want to spend the credit. Which I don?€?t.,1,14/01/2024

I ordered three items and was given a tracking number, it?€?s been 7 days since my last update to say that the parcel has cleared customs. Neither Temu or Evri actually knows where the parcel is so it may arrive or may never arrive. To be fair to Temu, the customer service were very helpful and refunded the full cost and gave me an extra ??5. But the catch is the refund was app credit not back onto my card so I can only use it to play Temu package roulette for a second time! I will give it a go and see if I win this time!",3,15/01/2024

"Placed an order for some craft supplies, and Evri ""attempted delivery"" on Thursday while I was out. They promised to redeliver the following day - no sign of my parcel. I contacted Evri, who promised that the parcel would reach me by the end of yesterday - it didn't, and they have now emailed me basically saying they've got no idea where the parcel is. I contacted Temu, who have refused to refund me because Evri have promised to redeliver my parcel! So the moral of this review is - don't buy from Temu. They have great craft products, but the unhelpful attitude they give when you run into problems is enough to put me off shopping with them in future.**UPDATED** to add that I still do not have my parcel, and that TEMU are still refusing to refund me. Cheap products are not worth it given the appalling customer service if you have a problem. AVOID!!",1,15/01/2024

Yes you do get a lot of messages but how do you think the company survives I said if you unsubscribe from the messages, then you only get them on the app. This might help some people that don?€?t like loads of messages, but again I can only give this company a price on the quality and the brilliant prices.",5,16/01/2024
"i've used temu 3 times now and have had nothing but excellent service. delivery within the time frame expected. returns refunded - again within the time limit. (option of return to orginal payment or a temu credit) i have heard a couple of stories about ""scam"" ""data sold to china black market"" etc so i do feel wary though Temu ensures that all information is encrypted. i must be fair and say that i have had no problem at all. i did throw out the vegetable chopper thing (mandolin) felt it was not worth the bother, then i ordered what i thought was famed wall art but it was not framed, it was a canvas poster which i didn't want (returned it no problem)  everything else I have been pleased with and have made another order today.",4,16/01/2024
"I have received 2 orders from Temu and am waiting for the arrival of the 3rd.  Overall, Temu?€?s quality is similar to that of Amazon?€?s.  Price is far lower, -50% in most cases.  Delivery time is much longer but Temu tells you when you place your order.  Most of my purchases are ?€?nice to have?€?, so the longer wait isn?€?t a problem. If they miss the promised delivery window by 48 hours, they give you a five dollar credit, which I received with one item of my first order.  Return is easy.  For low value items, they would give you a refund and allow you to keep the item.  I also received such a credit for one of my purchases.  Temu sends you a lot of email notices.  That can be annoying.  So  I send them straight to the spam folder.  While I probably won?€?t buy expensive electronics from Temu, it will be my go to place for inexpensive gadgets.  Some ?€?claim?€? Temu uses forced labor and sell customer data.  Well, I don?€?t know anyone who can certify Amazon, Walmart or other online sellers don?€?t use forced labor or sell customer data??????.  Temu has no membership fee.  Minimum order is $10, whereas Amazon?€?s is $25 and Walmart $39?€?need i say more?",5,16/01/2024
"Generally, you get what you paid for, and delivery is both reliable and fast, so no complaint. However, I've been having problems with declined payments due to security checks and blocks on my visa card since buying from Temu, and the bank has told me its because of a high incidence of card compromise among Temu customers.  They really need to get a grip on that, as I, and probably others affected, won't be buying again until they do.I'm sure it's not their fault, and it's not the first time an organisation has suffered from this sort of activity. I just hope they can get to the bottom of it quickly, as their service really is very good.",3,16/01/2024
"I won free items worth around ??50-60 even though they said they are worth around ??100. So it's legit. There are many usefull things to buy from temu and they  have cheap prices can't fault them esp the delivery is free anything over ??5, only thing to watch out for is when they show offer saying this % off for you ect, 99.9% it's false marketing I brought a tablet for ??90 full price few weeks later seen the  same one  for ??120 saying save 50% reduced from ??240 anyone who didn't see it before will probably think they are getting a bargain. I only buy things which I can't get from UK esp at that price. Somethings are cheaper in uk then they are on there. you can pick certain thing from pound shop and they are selling same items for ??2+ Many other things constantly pop up as reduced but they are not reduced at all most likely same price if not more.  sometimes you get offer buy items worth over this amount  and we will give you ??50-??100  voucher that's also a con, I brought certain items and got a voucher but that voucher was split into ??30-30-20-5-5 you can only use one  voucher per order and if you use the ??30 voucher for example you need to spend minimum 100  to use it, and remaining vouchers have time limit on they expire around 48rs, if you are carefull and smart about it it's certainly a good website/app but I don't like them useing cheap tactics.",4,16/01/2024

I bought an overnight bag with separate compartment underneath. It vaguely resembles the photo of the item I purchased. It has no support anywhere and came completely flat packed. It?€?s made from a very cheap nylon fabric but was usable. On the second use the lining has split down one seam where not enough fabric has been allowed for seams or extremely cheap lining and the stitches have pulled through. Difficult to tell. The bag only had a few overnight bits in and was not out under any stress. DO NOT BUY. Would I buy from Temu again? Absolutely not.,2,16/01/2024

I would highly recommend Temu to anyone.",5,16/01/2024
"After ordering items, they arrived on time but contained a live cockroach. I complained and was told that I could have a full refund and choose if I wanted to return the items for new ones or just keep them. I kept them to save the company money. When the matter was passed to someone else I was told to return the items to get a refund and that I would get a ??5 credit to spend with them. They introduced a cockroach into my home and then say sorry by trying to entice me to buy more that might contain more. You can't speak to anyone to complain. The supervisors send out blanket messages and it is clear that they don't care. They do not read what has happened but rather wait for you to ?€?go away?€? in frustration. If you do message it take 48hrs to tea response so matters never get resolved. There is no one to actually complain to. So, yes they do deliver but what sort of business practices are at play?Update: I had to threaten Environmental Health before any action was taken as Supervisors never bothered to read any communication I submitted before they responded. The team who are available to help customers are not able to do anything once an issue goes to the supervisors and it is impossible to have an ongoing conversation with that team. Ultimately this was resolved two weeks after the complaint. They did what they originally promised but only because it was important to me. There was no apology for sending a cockroach into my home. There is also nothing being done to stop this in the future. This is a company which operates as a central hub for suppliers and does nothing for customers except cheap prices. So yes, the costs are low but so is the support,aftercare or basic understanding of listening to a customer. I strongly suggest giving them a miss. They may be cheap but that's for a reason!",1,16/01/2024
I have bought loads and loads off TEMU. Ok a couple of the things were a bit cheap but Id say 99% was perfectly ok. It can be a bit of a rabbit hole once your on the site that's a couple of hours gone lol. I bought my grand son some under pants. I ordered them in a bigger size but they arrived and were still to small. They cost ??9. So I thought Id return them . I got in touch with TEMU and they just said don't worry we will refund the ??9 and I could either keep the underpants or give them away I gave them to the local charity shop.. The refund appeared in my bank a couple of days later. So far after a good few months of buying things off the site I really cannot fault them. Im also lucky to have a really good EVRI delivery man. Hes been with the EVRI for 5 years and is very reliable. Im waiting on a delivery today from TEMU. EVRI have give me a time 12.30 till 2.30. I really cannot fault either companies. Dont get me started on YODEL !.,5,17/01/2024
Ordered and then returned as not as described. No problem there though still waiting for the refund. I paid with Apple and have had numerous 2FA requests since this Temu order.

"I ordered three times from Temu, the first a watch which was worth what I paid for it, $5.00. Cheap crap. However, I ordered a pair of slip on rubber shoes which were very good. I ordered another pair for my wife. I ordered a set of ear buds, the left one wouldn't keep a charge. I ordered a second pair and the right one didn't work at all. I ordered a pair of sun glasses with built in Bluetooth speakers which are very good. The sun glasses are crystal clear and the speakers in the arm are a ok. I've spent about $30 so far, some of the items were fine while other things were cheap junk. So I guess it's a crap shoot on what you'll get. My take on the site is be prepared to accept some junk but nothing I've ordered was more than $5 or $6 bucks. It's kinda fun to see what you'll get.Bill",4,17/01/2024

I was very pleased with the products (household cleaning utensils) ,  the communication,  delivery times and pricing.  They seem concerned about customer service.

"My order was not delivered and I was told that they are not responsible as their terms and conditions state that once they give my order to the shipping company I am responsible for any loss, damage, or incorrect delivery! I bet most people did not read this part of their terms and conditions and have no idea of this! I will never order from them again and will now have to do a credit card charge back to get my money back.Edit: Temu replied to this review. As you can read, it has nothing to do with my issue and offers no assistance to me. Their purchase guarantee means nothing and they are just replying to my review with insincere niceties to try to deflect from my issues. Here is their actual reply to me when i messaged their customer service: I regret to inform you that we are unable to offer a refund or resend the missing package since the logistic record indicates that the package was delivered to the address consistent with the shipping information.In accordance with Section 11.1 of our Terms of Use, as cited here, "" When a purchase is made pursuant to a shipping contract, the risk of loss and title for Product pass to you upon delivery of the Product to the carrier.

Honestly I went into this purchase a little skeptical with some of the reviews putting down the quality and shipping practices but I was very impressed. It took a little longer than expected because of customs (no fault of their own) and they gave me a $5 credit because of it. The quality of the items were awesome. One of purchases was a wig for Halloween and it was beyond expectation. I'm not na??ve enough to think it will always yield this result but that is the risk of ordering. So far so great!,5,17/01/2024

First I thought I didn?€?t want to buy from China, then I realised that almost everything came from China anyway so I thought I would try it.Most of it is cheap rubbish. Firstly the dress photos I believe are in cotton, but the dress you receive is cheap polyester.I bought a ?€?linen blouse?€? it came 95% polyester and 5% Spandex and so thin. In the UK this advertising something it that it isn?€?t wouldn?€?t be allowed.I purchased some ladies briefs, I ordered size 16 which is called extra large, they looked pretty good, until I washed them and they would struggle to fit a size 12. Everything comes in a plastic outer bag.So things arrived broken. I bought ?€?linen look?€? pre-folded  table napkins but they arrived crushed, and looked more like cheap paper. I purchased a table centrepiece, that was cheap plastic and the corner broken.  I bought my great niece a tamagotchi, as I remember these. The instructions were referencing pressing keys which weren?€?t on it. Honestly it goes on and on. The reviews say hundreds of excellent reviews but you can only read about four, the rest is on the actual shop and of course they control what gets seen. All in all it?€?s a waste of time and money.   Although what we buy often comes from China anyway, I suppose the shop we purchase from controls the quality, material etc.",2,18/01/2024
"Incredibly cheap stuff probably because they simply won?€?t deliver them. I did a order with 10 items. Two different shipments and none has arrived. Customer service is a joke, only copy and paste replies and no actual help. Honestly for a first purchase I?€?m beyond disappointed and won?€?t recommend this to any one.",1,19/01/2024
"I saw this website on IG - and so I looked on TrustPilot and the reviews were 50/50 - but I decided to try it out on a small order.Order process went fine with confirmations all the way through and the item was delivered as advertised, good quality, good price - I was very happy with it.I?€?m now on my 4th order and all the items are great - so my experience is really good with Temu!",5,19/01/2024
"I ordered 2 dresses I had seen for $60 each on other sites. They were $17 for both on temu. What I received was not either dress. They were cheap and completely different!!! Not even close. I also ordered a plaque which arrived as a rolled up scroll and earrings that look like they came put of a cracker Jax box. Now I know. It's crap. One cell phone cord works. Hard to mess that up, I guess. Don't waste your money on larger items or clothes. Stick to cell phone cords. Ugh. All I got from temu after  complaint on Trustpilot was the standardized answer they send out to every unhappy client.",1,19/01/2024
"So many people say temu is a scam but I knew it wasn?€?t from day 1! All the refer a friend reward schemes were to get people to buy from there and see that actually for the price we?€?re paying, the products are amazing quality! Ignore the comments about some girl getting sliders that were hard well that?€?s funny cause I just ordered some and they?€?ve come and they were the softest shoes I?€?ve ever walked in! They feel like pillows! I?€?ve done about 4 orders so far and on my first one I got about ??30 off the price that it should of been, I also still have all those items a massive water bottle that?€?s never leaked, northern lights LED ball thing LED strip lights and a smart watch where I had 5 people ask me if it was apple! All for less than a tenner?€? so even if something isn?€?t up to the same quality as the photo it doesn?€?t feel like you?€?re wasting money due to the prices being so ridiculously cheap. I?€?ve ordered everything that I?€?m taking to turkey next month for my gastric sleeve, pijamas, socks, pants, universal plug, smaller water bottle, popsicle moulds, carry on bag for the plane, first aid kit, and the list really does go on. Also easy to get a refund if things aren?€?t as you expect. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.",5,19/01/2024
Best online shopping website ever. You got things at cheap price for the same quality you pay on Amazon.,5,19/01/2024
"Goods ordered. Online chat and I was unable to get any idea of delivery date.    Delivery was attempted to me, (via Ring doorbell I requested delivery to neighbour as I wasn't in) but it went to a depot and then returned to Temu.  I contacted Temu via online chat and was assured the goods would be with me the next day.  I received an email confirming delivery had been made however, no goods were received by me.  UPS tracking showed they had gone to a different town and been signed by someone called Fang.  UPS advised they went to the address put on the parcel by Temu. Again, online chat.  Assured it would be sorted. Nothing happened.  Another online chat and I requested a refund.  Lots of pressure to get the refund put as a Temu credit.  I am waiting to see the refund coming back to my card.  Email received advising it could take 5 - 14 - 30 days.Online chats are slow and time consuming.  I would not risk trying another order with Temu.",1,19/01/2024
"Ordered twice so far (UK customer) can?€?t believe how much cheaper items are. Some quirky buys too. Have bought mainly toys, kids clothes?€?great so far. All arrived within a week. Watch out for the fish land and farm land games, they are very addictive! 5??????experience for me so far.",5,19/01/2024
I LOVE Temu! Ive had about 7 orders now and everything is excellent and arrives very quick with excellent tracking.Yes some items are not as big as they look on the photo but they cost pennies!,5,19/01/2024
"Here in the UK the onus is on the seller to try and locate a missing parcel, not on the customer.I?€?ve had one hell of a time just trying to get through to a human at Royal Mail to find my missing parcel. Really not impressed so far, I don?€?t have high hopes of getting a refund.Won?€?t use them again.",1,19/01/2024
"Temu is a very well oiled machine. Great prices, quick shipping and delivery. I've had toiletries/sandals/homeware/jewellery all at amazing prices-unbeatable really. If they aren't suitable/don't fit you receive a speedy refund and don't have to send product back- -not sure about more expensive items. It really is amazing-make the most of it as prices might go up next year.",5,19/01/2024
"Although the items look good on the website, the goods are Very low quality.  My items went straight in the bin!   Avoid buying from Temu!",1,19/01/2024
"I mean, the stuff you buy is cheap for a reason. If you want stuff you can use once and throw away then keep this company in business. I will not be buying from them again, they are just another aliexpress.",1,19/01/2024
I placed first order on the 26th July arrived in time no issues. On the 11th August another payment was taken out of account. I have not placed an order! I raised this as fraud with Temu and they are saying its not fraud and that maybe I have another account or that another family member placed an order. This site is not safe to use ! I am now in dispute trying to get my money back!! UPDATE: got my money back through my bank but also had to cancel my card for safety. Temu were completely unhelpful and just continued to send automated replys like the one below. They do not take any accountability. Have cancelled my account.,1,19/01/2024
"Items were received and one product returned, unopened as I could see it was too small for what I needed. The refund was rejected, despite the fact I had never unpackaged it. If it failed its inspection, that means it wasn?€?t sent to me in the right condition in the first place, as it was returned in the same condition and packaging it was received. Refund rejected - do not use this company if you?€?re likely to return items.",1,19/01/2024
"I like this company. I know many people have left negative reviews, but you get what you pay for, if for example you buy a product at ??2 instead of ??10 elsewhere. I?€?ve bought items from this site much cheaper than say Amazon and have had 2 issues, this was with sellers advertising solar lights that were actually not solar and used batteries. I used the chatbot and I received an immediate refund both times and was told to keep the items.The deliveries are fast and traceable, well packaged and if the item is late, you get a refund. What?€?s not to like. I think the problem is that people buy cheap items expecting top quality materials, which is absurd.  Personally I like the site, make sure you check out the product reviews, if any issues then get in touch.  I?€?ve never been left disappointed with either the item or customer service, if the item wasn?€?t suitable.",5,19/01/2024
Great prices and customer service. Had an issue with my order and the money was refunded back to my account the following day. It was so easy. Delivery is also free. Honestly can't fault them and will continue with them as a customer.,5,19/01/2024
"I purchased four items from here as their website states they will give you ??100 to spend online if you order four items. Once you purchase the four items, it supposedly gives you 8 minutes to spend your ??100. I went to the checkout before the 8 minutes was up and the discount wasn?€?t applied. Scam",1,20/01/2024
"I first researched to make sure it wasn't a scam. It isn't! I made a small order first which took about a week to arrive and everything was as described. I've since made 4 other orders and waiting for my last one, which Evri say they have received. Can't fault them or Evri, who have kept me up to date with where my parcel's at on their app and email. Would recommend trying them. Be warned it can be a shopaholics dream, but addictive with the prices being so cheap. You can spend more money than you realise.",5,20/01/2024
Cheap price for cheap stuff,2,20/01/2024
Ordered a mosquito net for over a bed. It arrived and doesn't have an opening like in the photograph attached. I was weary about using Temu and I was right won't be using them again. Cheap rubbish that's not fit for purpose.,1,20/01/2024
"Received my package, very disappointed not the colour I order. I ordered silvery grey and ended up with blue.....",1,20/01/2024
"Fast delivery. Pricing is absolutely amazing. I was skeptical at first but I have yet to be disappointed with anything I have received from this store. I have purchased the smallest item (hair ties) to electronics and am not disappointed.  I have gotten earrings and they are beautiful and no they don?€?t turn my ears green and I have very sensitive ears.  Other examples are: video doorbell, plug in air purifiers(several) and they are my favorite purchase and less than $5.00.  I have a dusty house and within two days the dust was gone I only have to dust every two weeks compared to every two days.  Capri leggings, tshirts, neck fans.  I highly recommend.  They even have games where you can earn free items.",5,20/01/2024
Oh you lucky lucky people... Says soooo much about Trustpilot that they host this company..,5,20/01/2024
Bought a couple of dresses. They look nothing like in the picture. Quality is very poor and dresses are out of shape due to the cheap polyester material. Can?€?t wear them. Be careful of the cheap prices especially for dresses. It?€?s cheap because the quality is poor.,1,20/01/2024
"I know Temu products are going to take at least two weeks or more to arrive. The weather in the USA and China can slow or speed shipping.  True, their products aren't always packaged well. I think customs makes a mess of wrapping things back. Temu uses soft bag packaging so you are at the mercy of the merchant to package their products well. You are usually buying unknown or no name products. If you read the reviews,it can help make you a more informed decision. I've bought over a hundred products and at least 95% of the products are made well.   You have your sleazy seller in most online stores, American or otherwise. I've also seen sleazy reviewers, fake reviews meant to crush the competition.  The reviews look just like or similar to other negative review wordings from other online stores. There are also suspiciously fake positive reviews, too. They generally have nothing of value to offer the consumer. ""I love this item"". ""Came on time!"" ""As described!"". No pictures of the product in use, but they are shown still in shipping bag.  They provide no valuable information to the buyer whatsoever.Then you have your Asian haters or Republican Trumpers screaming foul. They don't play by the book. They don't talk facts with proof. Their items were damaged. Show us the package and the damaged product.They're all complaining. ""Only buy American."" The funny thing is, many things made in America originated in China!  American sewn? The material, thread, and embellishments are from China!I've gotten a lot of wonderful items from Temu. A majority of items I bought are exactly like the overpriced items meant to break us lower income folks in America.  The products have been very good quality for the most part.  There are some wealthy people who own big stores who might do anything to criticize or crush the competition. I bet you they buy their same stock cheaper online from these same sellers!I know WISH was terrible with false ads, bait and switch, fakes etc. I'm sure Temu has it's share of con artists. I've come across a few not so good products. Try to buy from the better rated stores. Some stores will be hit or miss.Temu has had good customer service for the most part. Usually it starts out with a BOT. THEY USUALLY ASK FOR PICTURES, PROOF to demonstrate broken products etc. If they refund your money it's either with instant Temu credit or money credited back to your bank or credit card which might take a week or longer.If you need to return something, you print out the shipping label and either reuse their old packaging, use a recycled box or brown bag of your own, or pay for whatever to ship it back. Shipping is free for the most part. Clothing is hit or miss.  Their sizings are very wacky. You must read the sizing charts to everything they sell. Every seller sizing is different.  A size small might be 23"" waist, 31 bust, 30"" hips. Another seller's size small might be 28"" waist, 35"" bust, 45"" hip. An XXL Might be 35"" waist, 43"" bust with no hip size listed etc. Each seller posts differently. Sadly, you won't always get an accurate description of the material. It's hit or miss. It does help if somebody gives an ACCURATE negative or positive review. ""Quality"" ranges between person to person.  A billionaire might condemn the quality because they can afford Italian leather. A poor person would be thrilled with any kind of leather as long as the product is affordable. Temu users need to be more proactive in reporting sleazy sellers or sleazy bait and switch practices.   Sadly, they are common on most online Asian stores. It would be nice if customers could ask reviewers questions.  Temu doesn't show many product reviews but the review numbers are suspiciously high. Know the difference between store ratings and product ratings. The search feature isn't the best nor is its layout format or search filters.  It seems like you scroll forever before you find what you want. You might search for ring and plastic gaming toss rings might pop up or a dog bed in the shape of a circle, or something off the wall like a shoe will pop up. Maybe it's the language barrier or poor filter programming.If the company went out of business I'd be crushed. I hate a lot of American styles or wares. Asian wares have a wonderful variety of unusual and useful products and clothing styles. They aren't ridiculously overpriced like the way that greedy store owners price in America.Overall, I give Temu a B+. Fix the sleazy seller issues, terrible shipping and packaging, terrible filters, and fake products (fake gold, fake leather or poor descriptions etc), I'd give it a B+.  Let users see all the reviews and allow buyers to ask reviewers questions.   Temu, use people's positive suggestions and I'll give your company an A. Too many dates of experiences to list since last year.   I'm a regular satisfied Temu customer",4,20/01/2024
"This business has stolen my copyrighted design and images and is illegally selling my items on their site.  Their entire business model is based on hurting the legitimate sellers that have created their own work and is simply stealing from themUpdate - I did submit an Intellectual Property Infringement notice and the item is STILL up on your site.  It's a farce that you claim you will defend the property of others, when you obviously only stand for the criminal side",1,20/01/2024

"I highly recommend temu, if you want to buy things that don't last... Hair elastics, stickers, rewards for your kids, scarves, pencils and so on. The cost is great, the shipping is quick. So anything that you would normally buy that you wouldn't normally last long, this website is perfect for. I have purchased from temu six or seven times now, and have been satisfied every time with the ease of shopping experience.My young son made the mistake of buying something slightly expensive, thinking it would be good quality. So if you want something to hand down to your children, temu is not the place. If you want something to bribe your kids to do their homework, or bribe your students in your classroom, then it is a godsend. They do send you a heap of advertising though, which can be super annoying. My phone gets a notification multiple times a day.",5,21/01/2024

I also cancelled and changed my card as I've heard of a lot of people's cards being cloned after using this site...too coincidental IMO,1,21/01/2024
I was a bit wary of buying on this site but the prices were very reasonable so I thought I would try purchasing  three items and was pleased how good my experience with Temu.com  was they gave excellent delivery and I was kept updated on the progress of my order,5,21/01/2024
"low quality goods. Also products might be made my slave labour from Uyghurs. "" Temu does not have any system to ensure compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).

I didn?€?t expect a lot and started off with buying a few inexpensive items but each order has been delivered both on time - and free ! Have ordered slightly more expensive items now and still fine. Really impressed.,5,22/01/2024
"Huge fan! Really should be 4.5 as i really do love Temu. Bought many 100s from them now ( mostly for my art/craft biz) with very few issues, esp considering. Theyre amazingly priced, actually give refunds and credits if price chgs. Yes, I dont expect tip top quality, but like I said, literally out of 100 of items Ive only run into a handful items that were not as described, Clothing has been a pleasant surprise w only one exception. Just check sizing feedback. Usually runs small, and hard to tell actual fabric content, or sheerness on AI mock ups. *Just really check sizing, ref pics on all things and you womt be disappointed. Sometimes the shipping lacks care, had a few things get bent, so largely unusable, but got prompt refund, no need to return. Turn off notifications...they can get aggressive. Have fun!",4,22/01/2024
"May offer return, but you are blocking my return by saying my institution has filed dispute against you. Paypal has rectified this and its showing on my credit card.  They filed against Temu instead of prior authorized amount on card I disputed $13.95.  Temu needs to remove block on my ability to return this, so I can",1,22/01/2024
I'm not a regular online shopper.  However I placed an order with Temu for end of year class gifts.  I was amazed at the range of selection and price.  My order was delivered within the week.I have since placed about 8 additional orders.I was sceptical about the quality with the price being so low.. however I have been extremely surprised by the quality.Costume jewellery and make up for a fraction of the cost in High Street shops.

I have ordered from you quite a bit well i have 36 grandchildren to buy for at christmas...so this website is so good and 99.5% of items ordered have been very very good items at affordable prices great quality and I will always carry on using you ...in this day and age the free postage truly helps and the late credits are a genuine show of your trustworthiness and also a true dedication to your customers ...keep up your hard work and thank you so much,5,22/01/2024
The platform looks promising. Cheap prices FAST delivery. The cheap prices are OK but delivery most of the times never occurs. Either they are out of stock (got compensated once) or they fake that parcel arrived at drop off parcelshop awaiting for collection (but there is nothing there). So most of the items you see on great prices are NOT available. Click and bait!!!,1,22/01/2024
"Just reading the reviews ?€? real customers are providing highly critical feedback and the so-called positive reviews are obviously generated by the company. I expect their reply, if any, will be a stock no copy and paste response that shows they don?€?t address specific concerns",1,22/01/2024

Just so long as you accept that you get the quality you pay for I suppose but a couple of my items were extremely cheap so when something seems to be too good to be true it generally is. I was actually delighted with one of the items I received and what I paid for it.  Just take care what you order.,3,23/01/2024
I?€?m very happy with this company and products it supplied. It all depends on what you want to buy because you have to see the cost and the product you are getting!All the stuff Temu supplies was definitely value for money and durable,5,23/01/2024
Sometimes you get good deals such as a drone for ??3...Art materials such as acrilic markers and air drying clay are a good value and quality...however clothes are ususlly made of cheep fabric and the picture looks different from what you get ...like a cheper fake product of something of a good quality.so buy art materials but avoid clothes and shoes,4,23/01/2024

Awful company to deal with, one of my items was missing, ask for item to be resent but after five yes five attempts, I gave up emailing them, as had wasted over 1hr 30mins sending photos and more and more repeated emails, so had to take a refund, seems like it?€?s all a scam for you to buy more goods from them (fat chance!), First and last time I?€?ll use this company, in my opinion the so called customer advisors don?€?t even understand English.After their reply (which you can see below), it offers refund but no replacement goods, so they have just confirmed what I initially stated, a scam to get you to buy more goods, as postage is only free when spending ??10 or more, so if you purchase multiple items and the item that?€?s missing for ??2, they refund you the ??2 but to get the item that was missing you would have to spend another ??8 to get free shipping and if the goods don?€?t turn up or go missing, it?€?s a vicious circle.",1,23/01/2024

"Well despite some bad reviews I thought I'd give Temu a go, the item I was after (Mini 2 se bag) was half the price locally and with free postage thought it worth a punt.

If things change I will update this review.",5,23/01/2024
"I just recieved a package from temu containing 5 different toys for babies.

I will not be ordering again from Temu. Poor quality material for clothing. One top which should have been gathered was only half sewn. A top that should have had sleeves came without.  Opened the bag with shoes in and the most obnoxious chemical smell came out so won't be putting them anywhere near my skin. Just a waste of money. As the saying goes if it's too good to be true then I probably is. Stick to the high street,1,23/01/2024
I really love some of their products others are not so good. But over a good experience. If a order arrives late I?€?m refunded 5dollars in my account. I enjoy shopping and seeing items I have never seen. Overall a good experience,4,23/01/2024
"I ordered a combination of hair accessories, makeup accessories, wardrobe accessories and one man bag. I was pleased with everything apart from one makeup case that came damaged, temu has refunded me the amount without me having to return it. These items were split into 2 parcels and came on day 6 and day 8 and could see where my parcels were at all times.I would definitely recommend anyone to check out the non sponsored temu YouTube videos on the quality of each product before ordering and not buy anything without being 100% sure of sizing and quality. I will be making another order next month but would be cautious of ordering electric items and non bpa food/drink containers.All in all, i had a good experience shopping with temu although somewhat nerve wracking at the beginning when I thought I had just been scammed.",5,23/01/2024
"I ordered a jacket from this company with free delivery.  Some days later I received an email from Evri, the delivery company saying that I had to pay an extra ""unpaid delivery charge.""This obviously seemed to be a scam so I contacted Temu on their chat system.  That was a disaster.  All I got was instructions to inform the delivery company that delivery is free.I have wasted so much time and all I have had from them is a statement that they have ""created a ticket""I don't know what the issue is that led to this extra charge but they clearly have no intention of putting it right or even looking into it to prevent it happening to other people.I have tried to talk to someone but all I can do is use a chat with someone who totally refuses to acknowledge responsibility. He just sends me links to company policy and tells me that it is not Temu trying to charge me, it is their delivery company.  I am sorry but as far as I am concerned my contract is with Temu and if they choose to subcontract to a delivery company they are responsible for the actions of that company.When a company behaves in such an underhand manner the least they can do is talk to the customer.  I have now been ordered to watch my computer constantly as a supervisor may or may not contact me at an unspecified time in the next 48 hours. I was not happy so he put me on hold to try to get a specific time, then, while on hold, the system decided I had been inactive too long and closed the chat.",1,23/01/2024
"I was pleasantly surprised how amazing Temu is. I placed my order on the 6th August. Was updated by Temu on every stage of my parcels process. It arrived exactly when they said it would and the goods I ordered were brilliant, good quality items. Will definitely be using Temu again",5,23/01/2024
Terrible company.Parcel didn't turn up.Waiting for a refund and credits. They have sent an email saying they have applied the credits but they haven't. Having to email them everyday to ask for the credits. Disappointing shopping experience.,1,23/01/2024
"Nice app for ordering products. But don't expect it will reach you in time. Till order and payment its a nice app. Then no support. Only we can chat with auto reply robots. I order on Aug 3, I got mail I will receive product by 19:00 to 21-00 on Aug 11. Then 19:30 I got a mail delivery attempt failure with my gate pic which was open 24hrs. I don't understand how they fail and what attempt they do without call or mail me that he is there for delivery. Or do I need to be stay outside from this 19:00-21:00 for them.Then without my concern/consent, they return the product. Aug 14 I ask for a refund and now it will take next 5-7 working days. Means we need to expect failure attempts in refunding also. Its my experience. Thanks.",1,23/01/2024
I have ordered numerous items from Temu and in all honesty have been extremely pleased with everything I have received and been delighted at the speed they arrive too.  I have found some of  the kitchen gadgets really useful and at a very affordable price.  I think I will be confirmed customer and am looking forward to their Christmas items they will I am sure come up with many things that I will find useful or decorative.,5,23/01/2024
"Update I initially purchased some items that I later tried to refund - but the refund was denied and I felt quiet shocked with neither items nor refund. The issue was solved now and I received the amount back. The five star recommendations is for the costumer support - not for the refund processors! I find these high ethical standards highly admirable and value the superb costumer support! InitialTemu has started out as a good experience, so I started to purchase more - but many clothes I bought did not fit my quality standard so I send them back (no problem for me!) - now comes the real issue; Instead getting hundreds refunded I only received 20 Euros back! A big shock for me was that they stated that the refund was denied due to the order not being returned, despite the fact that other items from the packages I send were refunded. Do I have neither money nor items in my hands now. I immediatly contacted them, and was told to receive answer within 24/42 hours - I haven?€?t heard from them until now and it has been 4 days - will continue waiting - but am a lot more skeptical now!",5,23/01/2024
"I find Temu to be very disappointing. It really is a huge scam. Most of the things they sell on their site is not as advertised. Everything is advertised as being too good for what you are paying but even the price is still steep for what you are getting. Alot of things show up broken or not even usable and they still want you to return the item to them broken. I sent pictures of a totally smashed unusable plastic container for $7 and they wanted me to return it. I'm basically shipping garbage back to them. It's just bad. Don't buy from them. Don't do it. Just buy what you need from a site where you can make uncomplicated returns and they acknowledge that they have sent you a faulty item. There are a few items that are ""ok"" only because when compared with the junk they actually sell, the ""ok"" item seems worth it.",2,23/01/2024
I have been using this site for over two months. Products are not on top quality but I can say they are fairly good. Return policy is very easy. Delivery usually on time. Price is good on a lot of items.,4,23/01/2024

"I have ordered five times from TEMU and was on the whole very satisfied.  However the last order I received I opened with excitement which very quickly turned to dissappointment.  I ordered five pairs of trousers in varying styles.  The material was very cheap, like lin9ng fabric ad the quality of the workmanship was extremely poor.  Im afraid that I won't be using TEMU again.",1,24/01/2024

"I'm sorry Amazon UK - and Ebay and charity shops - but ... TEMU has overtaken you all in my heart. Or at least my credit card expenditure anyway! I started slow on this just ordering a few things but have now got to a stage where I'm not just buying things I've always felt I wanted/needed (more the former) but have also started replacing old stuff - because most of it is good quality at some incredible prices. Even better in the old days (when I first started a month ago!) when they kept offering money off vouchers. I could do with a few more of those now please ... !! The (free) delivery isn't that fast, but they promise ??5 voucher off if the items don't arrive by a certain date. So far I've never had to claim one. And returns are easy-peasy - one free per order. I'm in love ... and addicted!",5,24/01/2024

I had 1 purchase which was defective, Temu were straight on it, immediately refunded my money which was only a small amount but told this time I had no need to return item & feel free to recycle. I am impressed with this company. I pay for my goods with Apple pay & find this the easiest way.",5,24/01/2024
"When first i saw Temu products are very cheap, made a mistake and ordered over 200???. After one month I got my order by PDP in worst condition( no box, some products were damaged). products were in very bad quality and almost useless. Some of them I could find better quality in 1 euro shops in Germany. What surprised me when i wanted to return some items, i noticed sellers changed the title and price of that item( for example i bought car seat cover set, but I received just driver seat cover when i wanted to return it the seller has changed article title to just one car seat. But i have screenshots of previous one. So be careful buying things from Temu because it a new version of fraud.",1,24/01/2024

I've been the loyal customer with this company I believe since they started. Within the last year I've had two packages go missing do the porch Pirates. I live in one of the worst areas in the city I don't understand why they're delivery people cannot knock on the door or leave package at a facility. So I can pick up they tell us to be home to except the package while some of us have jobs and can't sit at home all day. I had my last package go missing they refuse to give me a refund or send me a new item so being a loyal customer means absolutely nothing these companies make millions and expect you to stay home to except a package ... These delivery companies should know about these bad parts of town which they do because they deliver to them and yet they still be packages outside the doors shame shame on you temu I also understand there are bad people out there who like to rip off all these companies shame on you too because you make it hard for us honest people to get anything dealt with that's why team you should be handing packages to people that way none of this happens so easy but no everybody's in a rush rush rush......update Well you'll see I just got a reply from temu Wich dose not help me at all why would they reply if they can't help sounds like an automated reply anyhow they don't care about us just the money sham on you for not caring,1,25/01/2024

"Temu I think this company is special. Full of helpful ideas that can make life easier. On a practical note you have to be careful when unwrapping your shopping from Temu, it is easy to cut goods accidently as there is very little room left in the box and no inside protection. Secondly, the items with a sticker on, like plastic jugs and similar never been able to get glue off them.I wish Temu's basket had a ""save for later"" option because they sell such innovative items I have found there is more in my basket than I can afford at one time.Overall very pleased with my purchases from Temu.Thank you.I Love air fryer liners their brilliant, keeps kitchen appliance clean. But they must be used properly and with care. I say this because if you are like me and you take some of food out to eat and then put air fryer back on again thus reducing the weight holding the liner in place it can get lifted by the air fryer action/air and has caught the paper-like liner on fire. Excellent product if used with care. Trying to be helpful.",4,25/01/2024

I contacted TEMU support who were quite unhelpful. It seems everything is geared towards trying to get you to spend more money.I ended up having to open a case on PayPal. You would think a company would be quite concerned if they are selling a defective product that is giving people electric shocks, NOT TEMU...",1,25/01/2024
"Having read some other reviews, I took to playing the Fishland game and the Farmland game. In both, you deplete your resources (fishfood or water) and then wait 60 seconds for a box of replenishment to open. As this happens, you see your target line getting closer to completion for the promise of your chosen 4 free items which seem within reach. However, at the last 5% or so, when you have nearly met your target, the line no longer extends despite your continual replenishing. Both games are entirely pointless and extremely dull, and it is not possible to get the free items no matter bored you allow yourself to become. This company works on selling on personal information and there is heavy emphasis on referring friends in these games (so their data can also be bought and sold). I recommend you respect your own privacy and avoid these games.",1,25/01/2024

"Ik heb de bestelde producten tijdig ontvangen. Maar buiten de portefeuille was het bestelde waardeloos. Geen probleem om terug te betalen. Maar het terugbetalen zelf, dat blijft maar op zich wachten. Op mail antwoordt men niet, er wordt verwezen met een link. Waar men ook niet veel wijzer wordt. Wanneer ontvang ik mijn twee terugbetalingen? De antwoorden die men hier geeft zijn naast de kwestie, tenzij deze om de lof te versterken. TEMU is zeker te mijden, goedkoop dat wel, maar kwaliteit, dat is wat anders. Terugbetaling, fluit ernaar. Kortom: aftroggelarij. (zie #PO-020-17503441879630614)______________________________I have received the ordered products on time. However, apart from the wallet, the ordered items were of poor quality. There's no issue with processing a refund. However, the actual refund process is taking much longer than expected. I've tried contacting through email, but responses have been redirecting me with a link that isn't very helpful. When can I expect to receive my two refunds? The responses provided here seem to miss the point, unless they are meant to praise the company. TEMU is certainly not recommended; while it might be affordable, quality is a different matter. Refund? It's like chasing a mirage. In short: it's a scam._____________________Those are once again just empty words without any meaningful content or concrete action.

Whilst I received my first order in time and everything was fine.My second order I changed the delivery option with EVRI to Locker.The email address they use is for Temu and I couldn?€?t change it. This means I can?€?t receive the QR code or PIN that EVRI will send. The customer ?€?support?€? is based in a foreign country and don?€?t understand this and keep giving me a scripted response. This is the problem with doing business with companies that use cheap labour for customer services. I don?€?t know if I?€?ll receive myPackage or how I?€?ll get a refund but I made two other purchases around the same time and waiting to see if they arrive.

Prices r great. Some items r small but they weren't expensive so I can't complain. I love the laundry stuff! So handy and compact. No more big jugs of soap around the house as they have pods that smell amazing and laundry sheets that r so convenient. I love the free games.. I have won a few times! Just got my most recent prize delivered to my door today! I will probably b a customer for life if this keeps up! The tracking info is right on once it hits Canada.. Hence why they need your email and phone number confirmed for deliveries. Sometimes customs holds it for a day or two but they do release it.,5,27/01/2024

"Ordered various items, very disappointed in material and description. After checking my reviews, I noticed loads and loads of 5* reviews from the same person for the same item. This to me looks like they are putting false reviews on the website. I ordered Jeggings, only to receive a thin pair of leggings, they weren't Jeggings at all and not size 18, they just fit my daughter who is size 12-14. A coat turned out to be very thin material, nothing like on model, very disappointed. But to be honest,when buying cheap clothes, cannot expect it to be of good quality. Will not order from them again. I will stick to Shein, their material is way better quality. TEMU thank you for your reply. As the items were very substandard, you only get what you pay for, hence why I have no sought out a refund. The variation in sizing is beyond belief, but the false reviews shows  what type of company you are. After receiving the jeggings I looked at reviews, should have done this before, only to find 5* reviews from the same people time and time again. Nobody reviews the same item multiple times. Very suspicious ????. You can keep your refund, you need to change item description to be true, better quality for your products, correct sizing so all items are true to size, and ensure reviews are not false and repetitive, that look very suspicious.",1,27/01/2024
TEMU may not be BBB but from my personal experience I love TEMU! I have made several orders and received everything I ordered and things were as expected.

"I was going along ok with Temu with reasonable delivery times; kept up to date as to where my packages were and then one day recently, it all went down the rabbit hole. I had multiple packages appearing to be sitting in either Irving or Coppell, Tx for 9-10 days with no movement. I was getting no updates or assistance from Temu other than ""wait."" After finally getting someone other than a ""bot"" for help - we found one package just completely lost MIA. Temu has refunded me totally for that one. Thank you ""Bacho"" for all your help. Was grateful to finally get assistance and refunded for the 1st missing package. Still waiting on 2 or 3 others ordered. While disappointed I didn't receive my order, I appreciate the refund on that package. It was clear that I never received it. I hope assistance in the future will be easier than getting just a bot.Update on packages: Can be hit or miss but..They found a missing package of mine (in New Jersey of all places) - I'm in far S.

Depending what you want I mostly get necessary things for my business and other makeup products and just anything useful like hair ties etc. They do fast delivery usually says a month but sometimes I comes in a week. However be weary of fake products. If you have seen an image before of a product you know usually an expensive product, it is fake. Don?€?t not buy that stuff. Make sure to buy through Apple Pay or PayPal for safety and privacy concerns. I highly recommend SHEIN for makeup especially sheglam they do fantastic products.

"Everything I ordered came just the way it was described and looked good, quality products vary happy",5,28/01/2024
"My first experience with temu was amazing because at first I thought there could be no way that a website could give deals as well as temu so I tried it out for myself and got some amazing discounts on products I didn't even know I wanted. Their products are cheap, good quality and arrive in a short time with no shipping fee at all. All around an outstanding website.",5,29/01/2024
"I live in Australia and I haven't had a problem with Temu.  Three orders to date, two of which didn't arrive in the estimated time frame given and I was credited with $5 both times as stated and promised; however both arrived within three weeks.  The next order arrived in 8 days....wow.  I've only had one item missed from my order which again, was credited to my account within 24 hours.  You cannot ask for better service than that.Like ordering from any online company, you must be aware of sizes and always check the measurement guides.  So far, everything has fits.  I'm a fan of Temu and Shien, but no longer use Wish.",5,29/01/2024
"I?€?m writing a review for those who don?€?t trust sites like this because I?€?m also the same and was wary and  reviews on here seem to be fake so I tested it by ordering a small amount and through PayPal just in case and honestly the items arrived pretty quickly, give it a week or two but it?€?s international so that?€?s expected. I ordered 20 small things, a lot were fine like earrings, phone cases, some items were poor quality like the makeup and I got refunded for those without return so no issues. The items weren?€?t even the worst quality considering how cheap they are but I?€?m yet to get something more expensive. Reviews on products are legit too which is helpful. Overall I?€?d recommend it only because I can?€?t find reason to necessarily say something bad unless you count ethical reasons,..",5,29/01/2024
I have purchased a few items and delivered them one day earlier than indicated.,5,29/01/2024
Good service professional you do get gift legit company cheaper than ebay and quality is much better than ebay crap. Ebay customer service is appalling and quality is poor. Temu is the way to go.,5,29/01/2024

"I ordered some stuff and in a few days I got a notice that it was delivered to my front door, but nothing was there. I tried to contact Temu, but answer is: it was ordered, but doesn?€?t say to what home and unit it was delivered, only Street name and zip code.Temu doesn?€?t care!",1,29/01/2024
"I wrote a review recently only giving Temu 1star due to misleading information, It has now been explained to me how their cash ""bundles"" work, I still believe this to be a little misleading especially for new customers. However my order came on time was of a good standard  unfortunately I had to return 1 item which has been refunded without issue, I have also placed 2 more orders. Thank you Temu.",4,29/01/2024
"This app is great!! Search for almost anything in many categories (for me - home, clothes, pets, jewelry)!! I ?????? the Temu app! Easy to navigate. Trust and read the reviews before purchasing. You'll find honest reviews with videos and photos. I have contributed about 100 product reviews so far. I will tell you that especially on the clothing - I've noticed in the reviews that what's pictured on the ad model is not what they got. Zoom in and look at the fabric closely on review photos. This saved me so much time on my final decision. The silver s925 with zircon jewelry is BEAUTIFUL!!!! ???? I love the promotions and coupons. Customer service is automated at first until you need a live rep. CS is awesome. But usually I can resolve or get what I need from the autobot like extending a coupon I wasn't able to use in time. The return policy is PHENOMENAL. Super easy and straight forward. Shipping is free and imo all of my packages big and small came within a week which is not bad!! They even combine your packages. One of the coolest things about Temu is they have price adjustments if the price of the item goes down you get the difference!!! I've heard some people compare this to wish.com and AliExpress but I think due to Temu's marketing is why I tried their app and now I'm hooked. I've never tried wish.com but I have shopped on Ali Express. Temu rules the return policy!",5,29/01/2024
It is an amazing website with amazing high quality products. The only problem is that the deliervy is very slow.,4,29/01/2024
"The problem I have is there reviews. I don't believe  some of them ate teal with the names used and the language. I bought bag hardware. They look like being 50mm wide on the photo but we're about 10mm wide in actual fact .Another item was a pressed metal clasp good for nothing as it bent between my thumb and forefinger .I have to check the review , size and spec before buying anything .",1,29/01/2024
"Difficult to assemble as the screws did not all fit.  Very poor quality and a scoreline across the table top when received.  Even though it was cheap, it was not worth the money.  It is not that secure.",1,29/01/2024
"I am writing the review simply because i genially liked the service. I ordered two items and returned both of them, as I bought an alternative in parallel, which I ended like more. Nevertheless, the process of delivery and return was so easy and perfectly communicated on every step. I will definitely check temu in the future, as i think the overall experience is above average good.",5,29/01/2024
Placed a few orders. Products were as described and delivered in the promised time.,5,29/01/2024

"I have purchased from temu several times,I purchased 2 remote control holders,which I received 30th July.I was dissapointed with them,contacted temu was told no need to return them .I had an immediate refund.everything elseI have purchased from temu I have been happy with.I then had an order that was delayed by Evri and was due by 8th august.I received my order on 8th,but then had an email from temu giving me a??5 refund because order was late.great customer service",5,30/01/2024
"First of all, Temu has terrible customer service as it takes several hours even up to a day to contact any one in customer support.  Second, I ordered 20 items and out of that 20, 16 of those items had to be returned as they were cheaply made and subpar.  Third, it takes forever to receive the items I ordered.  I would rather pay more and receive better quality items that ship within 24 hours through Amazon.  Lastly, the return policy is much better with Amazon.  You have to wait for the items to be shipped back to China and after Temu ?€?checks the order?€? they decide if they will refund your money.  Temu sends me subpar items and then questions why I returned their cheaply made products.  No thanks, I will never shop online from Temu again.",1,30/01/2024
"Quality is OK for the price. Sometimes it's a bit hit and miss. I have re-ordered, but I take great care, and check thoroughly before checking out. Orders will take at least a week to arrive, usually longer. When an order went astray, their online chat customer services was helpful.Packaging is invariably (so far), an unpadded plastic bag, so boxed items sometimes get a little crushed.The minimum purchase and special offers are in annoying conflict, as you might put something you like in your basket, but by the time you've reached the minimum purchase, the offer has reverted to full price.No, or extremely limited 'ingredients'. Clothes might say 'cotton' in the headline, but if there (even) is any additional description, it might say polyester (etc.) but I've yet to see actual %. As such I've never purchased clothing. This is worse with medicines, including the very many crank/nonsense 'cures' and diet products for sale, none of which seem to have the active ingredients listed. Is that even legal?A return I did went smoothly, though the 'only one free return per order' rule is kind of annoying, and again probably in breach of the statutory rules. If 2 things arrive broken, I'd have to pay to return the second!",3,30/01/2024
Best Cheap Shop Ever! Today I ordered something fromTemu and it was just ??1 for sticker paperAnd for the portable printer was ??16 I can not believe it!,5,30/01/2024
"After 11 orders, wonderful!The returns process ( I have had a few items below spec) I find below par but not a problem.",5,30/01/2024
You get what you pay for with Temu some good deals but lacking in any kind of quality. I bought a few clothing items which were ok.My biggest issue with Temu is their courier service in the UK is (EVRI) out of 3 orders only one was delivered correctlyOne was given to the wrong address another was left on visible doorstep and stolen. I did finally get a refund after some resistance. I?€?ve now deleted my Temu account as I can?€?t trust my orders to be delivered correctly.,1,30/01/2024
"Disappointed!!Buying from Temu is wasting your time and money!!!The material is of very poor quality.  They post pictures in beautiful clothes but when they arrive they look like rags, a synthetic material, horrendous.  I recommend not buying anything from Tem??!!!",1,30/01/2024
Temu is the worst shopping experience I have ever tried. I've done wish banggood etc. So temu said if I spend a bit more I'd get more. So I was asked to pick 20 items for a huge discount! When the stuff eventually arrived half rthe things were missing. I checked order number and there were only 12 items. Those 12 items were 32?? . And real value in the shops is around the same. So no bargains more likea jum le sale I'm afraid!! BEWARE,1,30/01/2024
"I kept getting advertising from Temu.After months, I finally ordered.  I received today a T shirt Size XXLi ordered bigger because I wasn?€?t sure it was a good quality.Well,  it?€?s awful it just doesn?€?t flow nicely and it was badly sewed together.I?€?m going to donate.  I?€?m even embarassed to do that.  Maybe use it for cleaning furniture. A disatisfied customer!",1,30/01/2024
"Bought two pairs of earrings that are gorgeous, very happy.  Also 3 dog slip leads which excellent quality and a fraction of the price.  Services for all products was excellent.",5,30/01/2024
"Had no issues shopping with temu most items were great, I brought some boots that are great quality and really nice, clear shipping updates. I honestly haven?€?t had any issues and iv ordered a fair few times.",5,31/01/2024
Well I attempted to order from this site on 2 occasions and never got my order. This first time I used my sister's address and she never got my package. The second time I used my skybox and never got the order both times saying delivered. The first time I was refunded but the second time they are refusing to refund my money. I won't suggest to anyone based on my experiences,1,31/01/2024
"I got tempted with the prices and downloaded the app. As soon as I registered, I got notification that there has been a data breach and that my password was compromised immediately. 10 seconds later I receive a WhatsApp call from a dodgy looking Chinese number with ""All the love????"" wording next to it. Blocked it immediately. Could this be a coinsidence? Seems highly unlikely to me, as this is a first time I received a spam voice call on WhatsApp. I deleted the app straight after that.  I still receive Temu emails about items I might be interested in. I tried clicking ""unsubscribe"" button, but it just closes the email and I am still being contacted by them. Am I sorry I've ever fallen for this? Yes, very much so.",1,31/01/2024
"I have had all positive experiences with this site.  I have ordered from them alot.  The few times I have not been happy with the product they are quick to give me a credit.  I have done some of the promotions which recently lead to $100 credit in my account.  Some of the printed clothing doesn't look like the pictures but some have been exactly the same so some hit and miss there. I always size up so I have had no problems with the fit.  I have bought way too many shoes from them and have been happy with them all.  Such great prices.  I am more than happy using this site.  I have bought dollhouse accessories, household item, home decor, tools and many more.  Thumbs up from me.",5,31/01/2024
I have used them 3 times now deliver was 8 days to ireland so far so good,5,31/01/2024

"Great products, cheap cost, amazing value!",5,31/01/2024
"I very nearly didn't give Temu a try having read lots of negative comments about them. After avoiding it for about a month I decided to give them a try, I am so glad that I did, I love it. Yes, somethings have not quite been what I was expecting, mainly the artificial flowers weren't quite as big as expected but to me that is a little thing, when other things have surpassed my expectations, such as the stretch cushion covers, which are good quality and look great. I am very happy with what I have purchased so far and will continue to do in future.",5,31/01/2024
"I've been waiting since July 19th, 3 weeks now. The courier hasn't received the package. No way of contacting them. No information. Don't buy. 0 stars if possible. Edit: the same day I wrote this, I received an email saying my order has been sent. Took them 21 days to send it to the courier.",1,31/01/2024
You shouldn't even get 1 star.Don't bother wasting your money. The only thing they value is your money and will do their best to hold on to your money. They use Evri who are notorious for dumping parcels and will refuse to refund or reship if you haven't received your items. Sending back and forth to the couriers and Temu's customer service. Filthy scammers.UPDATE: I have already been back and forth for the past week with your colleague Lemon. You have no intention of resolving the matter and I don't have the energy to keep chasing you to do the right thing. I have already contacted my bank and will take my custom elsewhere. Not worth it.,1,01/02/2024
"I have found some really lovely items from Temu at an amazing price,however I have also had clothing items that look so good on my screen but are nothing like in reality! Over all great prices,delivery much quicker than expected( average approximately 8 days) But the thing that makes this site worth buying from is the online help centre, really efficient,friendly, patient & most importantly solve the issue. They really are there to help the customer! So I conclude, they're worth buying from,you have free delivery & hazzel free,prompt refunds.",5,01/02/2024
"Read this below:Temu made up a challenge for customers to get free gifts. The rule was to send the invitation link to friends individually, so that they download the app and do the spin for the gifts. And temu only gives 24 h for this challenge.  What was unfair is that everytime someone joins it cuts some remaining cost of the gifts..  and that was for me $4AUD , first person invited cut $1, then second only $0.50 then , only $0.20.. and it gets less and less so that you have to invite as many as possible.  I had  5 people who accepted the invitation in 24h and was left with only $0.30... however 2 more friends have accepted invitations after I ran out of time... that 7 people in total. And you know what, I did not even receive one free gift! For all my efforts! You know what.. you only think that temu is cheap, but it has expensive stuff like a kettle for $60 and other things.. that is still a lot of money..On top of that, I wanted to write a complaint and the website and the app has no contact list to email them . I replied to couple of emails with their notifications,  and it bounced , they do not accept any emails! That's why it works like a scam and their promotions are fake!They gave me 90% off one gift and They did not apply it to my choice of product!! Instead it was an imaginery 50% off a kettle which came down to $55 AUD ... SCAM!",1,01/02/2024

We be chilling,5,01/02/2024
"My biggest worry is the packaging. Today, my package came wrapped in (2) orange heavy plastic covers. Us, as consumers got after Amazon for packaging, Temu is looking to be gaining momentum. We need to be very careful with our resources. We will see this orange shining in our oceans, highways, & landfills. So far, I've gotten one to two okay products. You get what you pay for. I am searching for a few unique cleaning items and found them.",3,01/02/2024
"I love Temu! I've ordered so much stuff on there, including a cute sit me up seat for my baby. The prices are great and the quality of the items I've received so far has been excellent.I like the deals they have and you can also win money direct into your PayPal account by playing the games, or receive money off coupons. Highly recommend.",5,01/02/2024
"My brother had been purchasing from Temu and recommended it to me, as I have been buying from Aliexpress. At the time I ordered an item, it told me that if I do not receive the package by a certain date, they would give me a $5 credit. Well, they did much better than that - I received the item 2 days before the deadline. Then, there was a problem with the item I received, which was not their fault. I promptly went into my Temu app and returned it. Not only did they refund the item but directed me to donate it, etc. which means I did not have to spend money for return postage. I am very impressed and will continue to purchase from them.",5,01/02/2024
Prices are great ???? Delivery time is great ????The games and promotions are pointless and annoying ????I would consider using the site a lot more if they gave actual rewards and didn?€?t bombard me with constant notifications ????,4,01/02/2024
All products are fine but why is my acct constantly hit with alot of 1.00 charges listed as Atm fees ? Only happens after temu purchases,4,02/02/2024
"Temu is on YouTube. Temu had commercials running during the Superbowl. I read a number of reviews from SiteJabber, YouTube and Instagram. Here are some things I noticed. One people are saying small withdrawals are being taken from their accounts by debit  cards that are listed on their account page. Two be mindful of your credit card information and do not link other accounts that have access to friend list.Go into settings and turn off all extras. No linking to Facebook, Google, Twitter or Instagram. The more you link the more your data is comprised. Keep it as a separate app. Not downloaded on your computer. You can also use the browser without downloading the app. The invite for other people to join is like playing in a casino. Very few people get anything free. Don't buy more than $150.00 per purchase. Remember the items are scattered coming from different places and the items can't ship until the entire package is ready. Check your cart and the total. Make sure whatever is in your cart checked your ready to purchase. Keep in mind Temu has warehouses throughout the country. They are operating in 30 countries and they are still are expanding. So you email or chat about your order to locate it. They will refund your money in total and if it's late give you $5.00. USPS and UPS both deliver Temu. IF you can use express mail do so to get your products faster if it can be shipped expressed. For those that say the stuff is poor quality the same Vendors are on Amazon. The same items are on Amazon just at a higher price. The price for shipping is sometimes more than $7.00 with Amazon. Item we wanted to buy was $96.00 in shipping with Amazon. Forget $25.00 in the cart THEY still charged for shipping. IF you want value there are thousands of vendors on Temu. Look at the stars and read the ratings of the Vendors. For the most part Temu is still starting out they  just need some more improvements. Safeguarding people information.",4,02/02/2024
Temu employees response when requesting a refund act like scammers. Do not recommend to deal this Company. After a week of receiving returned items no correct refund was made and scammer employees are well trained in this field,1,02/02/2024
"Ordered various items over a couple of days.  My orders came in 3 lots, all quicker than I expected.     Very happy with all purchases.  The clothes were better than I thought they would be as I have been disappointed from other online companies previously.  I did order a size bigger on all clothes and all are fine.  I will be ordering again.",5,02/02/2024
"LOVE me some temu! Read the reviews, look at the number of sales, read the descriptions of the product. I always look for pics from customers. If it's something important, like a gift for another, I won't purchase unless I can see it on a previous customer in the reviews. We had one item that broke during shipping, it was a bracelet, my dau. fixed it in 3 seconds with super glue, good as new. Tip: consider what you are ordering and how it will all go together in the bag. They ship mostly in bags, so I'm careful not to order anything that may break another shipping mate but so far, Temu is very adept at packaging items. Temu is that store that affords me the opp to buy those items I see when out and about but can't justify paying $8-$15 for bc it's a want, not a need. I haven't worked my way up to more expensive stuff yet.....yet.",5,02/02/2024

PI thought I was using the offer given to me as a new shopper but there was no way of entering the offer and my money was taken. I cancelled the order as it wasn?€?t what I was expecting. My money was NOT replaced to me but kept by Temu. This is unacceptable to me. It appears to be impossible to contact Temu about this.Im really cross and feel scammedI used a different email to try and order from Temu with the offer of ??100 for my first order.When I cancelled the offer because there was no indication of the ??100 being given to me I had an email saying that the money I had spent had been refunded to my account in Temu. I replied that I didn?€?t want them holding my money but required it in my bank not there?€?s.I had 2 emails telling me that my replies should not be seen. I tried to follow the advice of how to reply but there was now access for what I was trying to say and I got no results from chat area either. Yesterday I tried to send an email to the address in Ireland but yet again it was impossible to complete because although I had an email sent to me to verify it wouldn?€?t accept my verification. So as I said there seems to be no way of actually getting in touch. I?€?m asking for MY money to be given back to me in my bank since I cancelled my order and am unlikely to make any other orders after this experience even though I have emails from Temu every day with more offers which I now doubt! Dorrie,1,02/02/2024
"I was honestly very sceptical about ordering from Temu as I had had a bad experience with a different overseas company. I placed my order for various ladies clothes and I was kept informed all the way from ordering to delivery. The clothes were very nice, good quality and fitted well. The only thing I wasn?€?t happi about were a pair of the earrings I ordered, they looked nothing like the one in the photo but I contacted Temu and was given an instant refund for them. So a very pleased customer. Will definitely order from them again. Delivery took approximately 10 days.",5,02/02/2024

I was notified frequently to track my order and it arrived exactly to the date. Thank you. Happy with products received although one T Shirt (Gentleman's Large) was slightly bigger than I thought the material was great. No returns needed for my first order. I have also ordered a 2nd time and currently waiting delivery which should be here by the end of this week. THANKS TEAM TEMU - I will be back. Have a great week Viewers.",4,03/02/2024
Be wary of them if no goods sent when stated also they do not answer requests for refunds no I real customer service so basically do what they like which is keep your money abysmal so called service,1,03/02/2024
Items I expected to be of poor quality were actually much better than expected. Be careful of sale items price *changing* while still in your shopping basket as you could inadvertently pay more than you thought. Shipping was much faster than a well known site similar items.

I was 11 pence away from my reward I then added 2 new followers though this is it I will win but Temu reset my game and I have to start again it is a scam pick cheap items and they might let you win,1,03/02/2024
"Amazing place to shop. I have an addiction and can?€?t stop buying from Temu. I absolutely love it. Had so many lovely dresses, Tops, all sorts of things. The jewellery is stunning.

"I was very sceptical when I came across this site, I thought there was no way it was genuine but I thought I?€?d give it a go. I ordered a few small items, came to around ???50 total. One of the things I ordered was similar to a game boy with old game boy games on it, it was less than ???10. I had no expectation for this. My whole order came in one package within a week. Some of the things I ordered weren?€?t quite was I was expecting, they were cheaper looking than I anticipated but some were great, the real winner was the game boy, I honestly can?€?t believe it, it?€?s brilliant, there?€?s like 200 games on it or something, I haven?€?t attempted to try them all but super Mario brothers, dr Mario, tetris and donkey Kong are all there and work. It?€?s lighter than an actual game boy and comes with a charger. I was so impressed with this that I will order from them again.",4,03/02/2024

Very cheap quality goods . Prices and not at all cheap comparing to UK street markets prices also ??1 shops and low cost stores. Return? is a nightmare. You have to take a picture of each item you want to return. So deceiving photos of items and fake RRP prices. Go to your local street market or your nearest 99P stores near you.,1,03/02/2024
At first prices seemed so reasonable I suspected a scam however after several deliveries my fears are unfounded. Goods are of incredible value and reasonable quality. Orders are picked and despatched immediately and if these are exported from China amazely fast delivery,4,03/02/2024
Love Temu the delivery service Evri lost my parcel got in touch with Temu and they replaced my money into my account even though it wasn?€?t temu fault. I don?€?t trust Evri delivery service I would gladly pay for for recorded delivery as the temu items are cheap and so far of good quality so I will still be using temu just shame about this sides delivery service ???? but keep up the great work temu keep giving us those bargains for many years to come yours reverend Graham,5,04/02/2024

1 of the best App/Website for online shopping,5,04/02/2024
"I?€?m glad I ordered from here so I know not to be tempted. Two lunch bags, a spray bottle and a sun dress. The lunch bags are minuscule. Seriously so tiny they are advertised to adults but might hold a 3 year old?€?s preschool snack. The spray bottle is fine and cheaper than Amazon. The dress is laughable. It seems to be made of the same fabric that cleans my glasses. Skimpy and cheaply made, going in the trash as the the material is too weird to make rags. Deleted the app. But hey, the spray bottle works.",2,04/02/2024
"Ordered from Temu a couple of times. The items are good. You get what you pay for. Some things aren?€?t amazing quality but it?€?s a really cheap item. However service is definitely slipping. Last couple of times it is taking a while to ship. Today I got a notification saying my item was out for delivery at 10pm and at a city 200 miles away from me. Spoke to customer services who didn?€?t have a clue what was going on. First they told me I couldn?€?t modify the delivery address, I never wanted to that?€?s the whole point. Second they said they could escalate it to the modifications team. Again I don?€?t need modifications but things to happen as I ordered. I knew I wouldn?€?t get the right response from this agent so hoped I could get one from the escalations team. Asked when I could expect a response. Six times I asked until I finally got told within 24 hours. At one point he said I wouldn?€?t get a response at all. Fingers crossed my item does miraculously appear if not I will be filing with PayPal.",1,04/02/2024
Cheap items poor quality. Don't trust the reviews beside the items. Tools are poor light metal. Most items don't look as close to advertised on their website.,1,04/02/2024
I am so glad I stumbled across this website. I really like the items I orders. What I almost like as much as the clothes and shoes is if I need to send something back they tell me to give to item away or donate it. I?€?m a disabled veteran and I donate a lot to o veterans. So this not helps me to reorder some else and donate the extra item to veterans organizations. Thank you,5,04/02/2024
Temu is  a great site the only thing to be aware of is the pay limit other sites you might of visited like aliexpress or amazon don't but just go with it because at the end you will get you package perfectly I order some football cleats and their are perfect even in sizes,5,04/02/2024
"Wish I could leave a minus rating. Avoid at all cost, absolutely no customer service, they breach our uk consumer rights, sell low quality itemsYour response is also a lie, I have several missing items and you have refused to refund them even though I have photo evidence and you have admitted the package was opened, you have told me to go to the courier for refund. So your promise is not a promise, it is a lie",1,04/02/2024

Very fast delivery but what really is letting  temu down is the unhelpfull customer service advisers u get some that go out and beyond to be really help full and than you get loads  that don't read and listen to what ur asking them and when you say u want to be transferd to promotions and games they refuse to do it and they also say u have no expired copouns even though u have its really bad,1,05/02/2024

"Evri admitted negligence after a lot of hard work re my parcel Temu refunded. Ali express refused. Will never order from Ali express again.  Be warned though. They both use Evri!!!! If u are not at home You will never receive your parcel. Even if you are at home, they will not knock on your door. Evri will just throw it somewhere!!!!!",5,05/02/2024

"honestly, the quality of their products are good.I have ordered twice spendig more than 50?? and I am contented with my orders.fast delivery too (they state 10 days) and it arrives before or on date.I am satisfied with the quality of their products. some may come up small but they have all been good.",5,05/02/2024
"Was enticed by the intro offers and they had some items that I genuinely wanted that couldn't be bought anywhere else, interesting clothes etc. Placed 2 orders for 7 items total with all the advertised discounts was a fair price. My order was merged into one delivery and I was given the same tracking number for both parcels. Sadly when my one package arrived it contained 4 items none of which were in either of my two orders, all new but complete junk and worthless. They get one extra star because they met the bare minimum customer service requirement of refunding but any interest in this shop is gone given how catastrophicly they messed up the order. Deleted account and won't try twice.",2,05/02/2024

I love you guys. I've noticed there is also measurements for inches now tnx. Was getting tricked. I would love on the home page you can see how to apply your credit from ordering that is accumulated. Can't figure it out. I could have used it I just ordered two things but all in all very satisfied. I've ordered alot ????,5,06/02/2024
"I am deeply disappointed with my experience on Temu. Despite putting in the effort and fulfilling the necessary requirements for a prize, I encountered blatant attempts to avoid awarding me what I rightfully earned. The lack of transparency surrounding their data practices also raised serious concerns about the safety of personal information.To make matters worse, the customer service team, especially Erin, showed a complete disregard for my concerns, leaving my customer service ticket unanswered and unaddressed. As a loyal user, I expect better treatment and a prompt resolution to my issues.It's disheartening to see a platform that boasts about its customer satisfaction fail so drastically in fulfilling its promises. If Temu continues to ignore these issues, I am ready to escalate matters and bring attention to their deceptive practices. Data privacy and fair treatment should not be compromised.I urge potential users to exercise caution and consider my negative experience before engaging with Temu. I hope they take these concerns seriously and strive to improve their services to regain trust from their users.",1,06/02/2024
"I sense a trend, Temu only respond to five star reviews. Hey you lot, break the trend and tell me why my watch, that you said would be delivered on the 26th July or at the very latest the 28th of July has still not reached me today, the 4th of August? Trustpilot ask for ""Date of Experience"" How the heck can anyone put a date to something that hasn't happened yet? EDIT: Temu asked Trustpilot to ask me to provide more details or this post could be removed, here is the email received from Temu today (5August2023) that confirms they are clueless about what is going on within their organisation, their choice of courier also says a lot about the level of service they are prepared to offer. I do not recommend anyone using them, the one star rating I gave still stands and as the old saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true then, you know the rest.....

Here we are a MONTH LATER and still waiting for my 270 credit!  File a complaint with the attorney General in your state along with the BBB!  Don't shop Temu !!!! Screwed up my orders not once but twice today.  Haven't given my temu credit that's 270 dollars and then refused to credit my account for all the hassle!!!! Save yourself the trouble.  Shop elsewhere!,1,06/02/2024
I ordered 2 different things and I got notified that both of the orders have been delivered but nobody in my family ever received it and I have been chatting with the customer service and they keep on declining on refunding my money ????????????????????????????????,1,07/02/2024
I have bought a few times from Temu and been quite happy with my purchases  couple of purchases have either been cracked or not working but each time Ive either been given a full credit or money refunded and didnt have to return products,5,07/02/2024
Very poor after-sales service?€?.No accountability?€?.No help in getting your undeliveted items saying you can't get refund until item has been delivered which has still not arrived.?€?Delivery company Evri is worse as you can't even get anywhere with them telling you they can't track your details but make you waste money calling an expensive telephone number that has no human!I requested their complaint procedure and was ignored.I was told to contact the courier company myself.I was told the courier company will attempt redelivery even though I informed them countless times that no delivery attempt was made.They provided me with a telephone number which was 0330 808 5456 for me to deal with the courier company which stated they did not recognise my tracking number.I found the process unnecessarily tedious and complicated.I expected them to have contacted the company and dealt with the issue not asked me to deal with it.I requested that the item is Re shipment and was told I had to wait until the courier company had changed their delivery status?€?.,1,07/02/2024

"I ordered twice from Temu, the 1st order came and the quality was absolutely terrible, I sent the order back . A few weeks later I tried it again thinking everything can?€?t be ?€?pants?€? but how wrong was I ! The clothes where terrible quality and the shoes well I have no words. I know it?€?s cheap but it?€?s cheap for a reason . Not for me I?€?m afraid.",1,07/02/2024
I have ordered at least 6 times now and everything has been as described including clothes being true to size.  I had one item delivered which was broken and it was refunded immediately.  I will definitely keep shopping here.,5,07/02/2024
I've never had a problem with temu...have always gotten what I ordered,5,07/02/2024

"I was extremely skeptical with the first order, so I held back.  I needed a new backpack and a couple of other smaller items.  A backpack here in Halifax will run you roughly $100, but I ordered one from TEMU for $4.08, yes that's correct and to my surprise it's of better quality than my previous backpack.  I just placed an order for sneakers and shoes.  Fingers crossed that the craftmanship is as comparable to that of the backpack.",5,07/02/2024
"Some items were okay, 70% of the items are not the best quality but was expected to a degree because of the prices however, the bombardment of text and emails after the sales IS TOO MUCH!!! I 100% regret buying from them. Unsubscribing means nothing as they still continue to harass with offers by emails and text. I don?€?t know what to do!! I hope this review is read by them and they actually respect customers request when they unsubscribe!",1,08/02/2024
"Having previously said how great the products and customer services are for this company, I now share a really disturbing incident that happened today. I was unpacking a package from them and came across a LARGE, RUSTY, SHARP RAZOR BLADE with the company orange plastic wrapped around to make a handle. Imagine what would have happened if it had been a child diving into the parcel....doesn't bear thinking about. I immediately tried to find a phone number (don't bother they don't work/exist) so went onto their 'live' chat and put down what had happened, WITH PHOTOS of the package and offending blade. Over then next couple of hours I was passed to several 'live' agents all of whom started from the beginning with 'how may I help' etc., but the last lady actually read the previous messages and saw the photos and came back with an apology for the warehouse ""sluggishness"" and said they would bring it to their attention. Sorry, not nearly good enough. I want someone with some actual clout to contact me (gave them my e mail and tel. number) so we can try and make sure this never happens again. I told them that if no one contacted me I would then go on Facebook and Trust Pilot to make the buying public aware of the danger, and the fact that apparently Temu don't give a flying fig about their customers' safety.  So I have warned you...keep hands out of Temu's packaging.",1,08/02/2024
"I have made several purchases with Temu and all have been very good,mostly clothing,as with everything online you need to check the sizes and also use the reviews,I would recommend Temu",5,08/02/2024
"Temu is awful and their customer service is the worst. When you order online sometimes things happens, however a company worth is shown by their customer service professionals and how they resolve issues not just the cheap items they sell. I purchased an item on a gift card after purchasing my item I got rid of the gift card big mistake. There was a problem with my order I contacted Temu and they decided to give me a refund. I mentioned to them I no longer had the the gift card and please put my refund on my Temu account. What did they do they put my refund on the gift card I no longer had. It took a week to correct this. I spoke to countless incompetent customer service reps and supervisors/ managers, because they couldn't understand the difference between a gift card and a bank card. Jomar or Jonar whatever this incompetent idiot is in the resolution department could not decipher between a gift card and a bank card and made my experience unbearable. I will never ever again buy from Temu, AliExpress is 100 times better without the hassle. That's where my money will be going in the future.",1,08/02/2024
Bought a cardigan which arrived today in the smallest bag they could ram it into.When I eventually got into the bag(all taped up)I found the cardigan all screwed up and wet!!!The quality is nothing like the picture but due to the cost I won?€?t bother going thru the hassle of returning it but will not be buying again from them.,2,08/02/2024

"I bought 5 items of clothing. None of them were the right size. Their size guides are terrible. The actual clothes were of decent quality. I was able to send them back, tracked. When I checked the tracking several days later, Royal Mail showed that they had been received. I didn?€?t get an immediate refund and contacted them the next day. Eventually, I was able to chat online with long wait times between answers. They couldn?€?t locate the returned items.I have finally received my refund but had to really fight for it and shame them on Trustpilot. I've given them an extra two stars. They need to sort their sizing and refund issues.",3,09/02/2024
I was wary when I first ordered but I guess all online retailers have to start somewhere so gave it a shot.  Have now ordered several times and glad I took the plunge.  Their stuff isn't the greatest quality - at their low prices don't expect high-class goods - but it certainly does the job.  I'm happy to keep ordering from them.,5,09/02/2024
I sent 3 items back in the same parcel and have only had a partial refund for 1 item. Very dissapointed as iv messaged and recieved no answer back. It has been about 6 weeks.,1,09/02/2024

"I think that you, together with the evri delivery service, are trying to do this, you are already using them for a lot of money and, like a family, you did not pay compensation( only put temu account 5)but you do this repeatedly to deceive people and use their money.

"I am perfectly satisfied with your product. I am however totally disappointed with your delivery company. I reside in a very sheltered housing complex comprising of 24 flats over just two floors. My parcel was left outside the main entrance to the building where there was an obvious door bell to ring. Your courier left the parcel outside the main door to the building which I have a photo of without ringing the doorbell, anyone passing could have walked away with it. A relative of a resident was entering the building and noticed it. He noted the flat number and delivered it to me. I am totally disgusted with this attitude, some of us are disabled and the courier doesn?€?t even ring the bell. Not impressed. I do not mean to deride you as a company as so far I have been very happy with the products I have ordered, I am however very disappointed with the courier and delivery service you contract to, their service leaves a lot to be desired, and performance is well below expectations.",1,09/02/2024

When I clicked the system told me, sorry that prices have changed. When clicking, Temu wanted to pick EUR 101.- instead of EUR 71.- from Paypal, but Paypal denied payment, because I limited the account to EUR 75.-. If not, TEMU would have catched EUR 101.- ignoring the promised voucher!!!! Then I was kicked off the system and the system told me to pay the full amount EUR 101.- without voucher. They told me to order further EUR 49.- to apply for another voucher.2023/08/03I claimed yesterday at Temu help service: They reacted within 24 hours and everything is good now.

"Unfortunately, my experience with Temu was awful. I bought tons of items and was anxiously awaiting delivery. The parcel came with no time, but to my dissapointment, they have sent all wrong items. I clearly got someone else's order. Took a picture, filled in the form on their website asking for a refund and guess what? It was denied! No reson given. Spoken with customer service, just to be prompt to send items back. No apologies, no compensation. From the goodnes of their heart I was given free return label. Thankfully I have paid with Klarna and raised this issue with them. I was refunded the very next day. So I guess, this company is ok until there is a problem with your order. It was a nightmare to sort it out with them. Very bad experience, not going to shop their again.",1,10/02/2024

After one week of run around, the shipper indicates they have destroyed the item and to go back to the seller, Temu. Temu keep pointing me back to them. Constant back and forth with no service or resolution whatsoever. My advice do not get tempted by the 5 to 10% lower prices and place your order with other reputed sellers like amazon. You will have peace of mind and wont have to deal with this hopeless company.",1,10/02/2024

"Really enjoy shopping here. Good quality products, good prices. Arrives in good time (a few days to a week)",5,11/02/2024
"I have ordered quite a few things from this website, more specifically items for my new kitchen. Most of the items I have received has been of good quality, and have seen them sold in the UK for double, sometimes triple the price. They also have a price adjustment feature where you can request a refund for the difference in price, should the item/s you ordered go down in price within 30 days of the transaction! I see a lot of the bad reviews are about clothing items. Personally, I cannot comment on that, as I do not order clothing from anywhere other than my usual specific stores.  Delivery is always extremely quick (never waited more than 1 week), and you receive updates with despatch and tracking details. Orders can also be fully tracked via the app. On one occasion a glass item came broken due to poor packaging however this was immediately refunded via the app.One thing I don't like though is the games. I find these to be a con and a waste of time. Unless you have a huge following, for e.g ""influencers"" or if you know 10s of people willing to participate, then you have no chance whatsoever of winning anything, even if you do place multiple orders so I gave up on the games a while ago as they are a waste of time.",5,11/02/2024
The items I got came very fast and were really useful,4,11/02/2024
All their promotions are fake. Looks like they use bot accounts to make an ad. They look legit but they are the biggest scam in 2023.,1,11/02/2024
"I found Temu by accident a couple of months ago. I have bought lots of things from them, clothes bags, shoes, perfumes, all sorts of things. I have never had a problem with anything I have bought. Only once and it was sorted by the next day. If you are careful and  remember  all their things are really cheap buy with an open mind.  I Bought a dress and it was too small so I gave it to my grandaughter. Be wise shop carefully.",5,11/02/2024
"Goods and service was brilliant to start with but then I ordered 2 dash cams and neither of them work, I contacted temu and was passed from one department to another having to explain the problem over and over again, I was getting nowhere fast as and very frustrated so I gave up and will never shop or recommend again. I'm going back to Wish.",1,11/02/2024
"I am very disappointed in my order, was very cheap and I will never order from them again, so buyers beware it most definitely a scam, I really expected more quality in my items",1,12/02/2024
"A few things are good, however most is chinese junk.  (The Crap not the boat)Beware of electronics and anything with sophistication.  Lack of support.Be careful of bait and switch.  You click on the display ad and they move you to a different product (color, model number, almost any change) and the price goes up a dollar or two.Better products and support from Amazon.  You will paya few dollars more, but it made up on not having to keep non working things.UPDATE:   They are refunding for nonworking items.  But beware it is ONE refund per order, so if you order multiple things you must test them all before you commit.  This is NOT the way AMAZON works, you can order in advance and return as needed.  But at least I did goive them one additional star for their response.",3,12/02/2024
I have ordered about 5 orders already and they don?€?t disappoint,5,12/02/2024
"I've bought quite a bit from Temu and been happy with most things. Clothing and shoe sizing is a bit odd and I've had to return some things but overall happy and returning items is easy.  However my last few orders have been cancelled and refunded 'due to unusual activity' - its an automatic thing but none of the online agents can explain whats happening. Screws up my paypal and I've been using the same paypal accounts since I started with them.  I don't like it and if it goes on withut some explanation I am going to stop buying from them. Up to them now to sort it out.  My complaint has been ongoing for days and i've had about probably a dozen orders cancelled and refunDed.  No fault of my own, I paid, they sat on my money then cancelled the order and refunded the monEy but as said makes a mess of my payments.  Plus  I then have to try and redo the order and as I am buying the items for charity fundraising mostly it's a complete pain. AS OF NOW TEMU HAVE CANCELLED AND REFUNDED ANOTHER 4 OF MY ORDERS FOR THE SAME REASON.  THIS IS DESPITE ME PROVIDING THEM WITH INFO TODAY AND USING THE SAME PAYMENT DETAILS I'VE ALWAYS USED.  THEY ARE A NIGHTMARE AND NO ONE HAS COME BACK TO ME.  MY PAYMENT ACCOUNTS ARE A MESS WITH ALL THE PURCHASES AND CREDITS.  AND I LOVED TEMU. NOT ANYMORE.  WHEN I'VE SORTED THIS I'M OFF",1,12/02/2024
"Where can I possibly start. Placed my 1st order after being sent a ??20 discount voucher. Waited and waited checking on Evri only to find out Evri left the parcel in a communal area and it was stolen.Money refunded and another 2 orders placed, waited an waited, evri kept saying we have your parcels and will deliver tomorrow, it said that for weeks, finally told by Temu that Evri lost the orders. Refunded money, 2 new orders placed and get told that 1 of the orders will be split into 2 parcels, making 3 in total. Finally it arrives in 2 parcels. A real shame as I think Temu is not a bad place but they use a terrible courier.",3,12/02/2024
Cheating company. Awful customer service. I ordered they sent it to the wrong address (for some reason they changed the postcode but got the street name right). I was asking them to reship and they said they could only reship to the wrong address again. They then processed a refund without discussing it. That presumably means they don't have to pay the ??5 discount for being late which is a bit of a scam - if you don't deliver at all and get people to reorder they save ??5. I thought they'd be a new place to shop but back to ebay and AliExpress......Added after reply: Unfortunately they don't address the issue and they don't answer the issues. I contacted customer services again as asked. They apologized but apparently don't have access to account addresses. There was no mistake on my side as the shipping address was given by PayPal who don't randomly change addresses. Why couldn't they reship to the correct address with the discount for being late but could reship to the wrong address? There's an obvious reason in their reply - if goods are later than 15 days they are free. They didn't want to honor their guarantee so refunded the money. A reorder means I have to pay. So the goods may be ok but don't be suckered by any delivery promises as they are a scam. Customer services are not as stupid as they seem - just organized so they don't have to pay out on guarantees,1,12/02/2024
"Goods arrived promptly, I ordered a jacket and long sleeve shirt.The quality of the jacket was poor and was incorrectly sized. The shirt was of a slightly better quality and was a perfect fit.As I ordered both items for the same size, I can?€?t understand how one is a perfect fit and the other way too small. Therefore a bit of a mixed bag.",3,12/02/2024
Order 4 shorts and 4 t-shirts for about 37$ including shipping. I was truly amazed by the quality. I wad expecting some bad stuff but it wasnt. T-shirts little bit small (should taken a larger size) but overallt very good products and quality.,5,13/02/2024
Ordered quite a few times..never had an issue. First order didn't arrive on time (due to bank holiday) so they gave me ??5 credit. All items are as expected - just read the descriptions. Shoe sizes are a little smaller so size up a size or half size. Ordered 2 sizes of trainers to be safe and wanted to return the smaller size..gave me refund within minutes and also said I didn't need to return the item..just donate or gift them. Yes they use Evri but I've never had a problem and now getting to know the driver :-)!! Love that you can find absolutely anything!!,5,13/02/2024
"Update- the reply from Temu shows they haven't read my enquiry. The parcel was showing as delivered when it never arrived,  I've sent Temu my tracking order number already so it appears we are no further along with this! I'm losing the will to live now.....My parcel was notified as delivered but never arrived. I was in all day and can see a delivery van from outside my window Contacted Temu who said contact Evri who have said they will investigate but I have had no further updates. This is very poor service indeed with the usual difficulty contacting customer services that I associate with 3rd rate companies. Beware if you order anything and it doesn't arrive,  you will have a difficult time trying to get any answers from Temu",1,13/02/2024
"I was a bit sceptical at first but decided to order from these , i was over the moon when my items arrived , I'm now on my 4th order , tracking all the way until it is delivered  , good quality stuff and an amazing price , whats not to like , i love this site ???€",5,13/02/2024

"Excellent prices, of course you need to look at photos and read the Info carefully, if something obvious is not mentioned, it's not included. If you are careful, there are lots of good products at Excellent prices.Delivery to Ireland is excellent and over 5 orders, nothing has arrived damaged. Out of 10-12 items, 2 did not meet the basic functional requirements(low cost). These were credited immediately, with no return necessary in the space of 2 minutes. No complaints, they do what they say they will do, in my experience so far.",5,13/02/2024
At first I was really reluctant to order due to so many bad reviews but I can honestly say they kept to their promise. I ordered 8 items ranging from toys for the kids and household  repair products . Soon as I ordered I received an email confirming the order and a from then on numerous emails updating me with the delivery including tracking details from evri. My items were ordered and delivered within less than a week which is amazing ! I can now trust temu and will continue to order!,5,14/02/2024
Another brilliant service from Temu.  I have now had 5 deliveries from this Company.  I have been advised of progress every step of the way.  The orders have all been complete and delivered promptly.  Well done Temu!,5,14/02/2024

"I've ordered three times now from Temu and each time the goods have been delivered earlier than they said and the quality of them has been fine. I've mainly ordered stationery and files, gardening bits and pieces and odds and ends for the house so maybe I've been lucky. Of course the quality hasn't been top knotch but you're not paying a lot of money and certainly the stationery etc. has been adequate and the garden equipment was excellent. They're a discount company so as long as you don't expect first class quality (which you're not paying for) they're fine. But I can see some people say the goods received have been rubbish and if so that's not acceptable.",5,14/02/2024
"Sent back a pair of trainers as they was basically rubbish.after 2 weeks no refund.Got hold of live chat for the second time explained that they had not given me refund he said we haven?€?t received them back ,I pointed out to 3 times they have previously told me they had received them. He then asked for a screenshot of the return receipt from Royal Mail,I sent him that clearly showing that they had in fact received them back on the 24 July. Even then he kept saying they had not received them back .This implies that they cannot be trusted. I will not tolerate being accused of lying or being dishonest which is what they did ,they are a disgrace .well is that your poor excuse as an apology  temu you disgust me even more now no apology no remorse well you I will never ever be using you again you certainly do not have any shame but then should I really be surprised by a Chinese company NO",1,14/02/2024
"First of cheap price, second great quality and service. I love their price adjustment policy. I am reducing one star because I missed ??3 off and free gift , now it is no more. It will be my fourth purchase. I believe there should be some special discount for returning customer. In my last order, I wanted to return something for size issues. They return the money and told to keep the item too! I couldn't believe it! Awesome",4,14/02/2024
temu charged me twice for the order i made. I doesnt appear on the app but it appears on my bank account,3,14/02/2024
Pathetic service. I have order one month back and received nothing. I spent one month after I order from them. One month they I was tracking my order and they have  poor courier  service.they sent my courier back to sender without making any attempt and it still shows delivery on its way. Temu refunded my money back after my all struggle. It is like they track you by offers and just block your money and then return back. I just received one item from my whole courier and that was also defected. I feel like I was doing job for this shopping site because they wasted all my time to track orders. Talk to customer service on temu or Evri courier company,1,15/02/2024

"I ordered some items that got into the hands of ""piggyship"" which delivered my package on the first run. This time they are making excuses that they can't get in the building or address is incorrect. They still haven't delivered past the delivery window . There's no way to get them to answer calls or emails for delivery instructions. Temu keeps stalling and buying time to prevent issuing refund or reshipping order with more efficient delivery service. Ive asked for my money back several times and currently on a ticket request for refund nobody responded about anything it's been 2 days . It's obvious they stole my package due to the fact it hasn't been returned to sender. Customer service is horrible they're no different than the robot . I think a class action suit should put these people back in check because this is clearly unprofessional at its finest . More deceptive than accurate I've never had such an issue with any company especially the fact they don't care about customers at all. Once you pay they yell GOT EM",1,15/02/2024

"Update:  It has been confirmed with Temu Chat Support  that there are ""NO UNPAID INVOICES""  associated with my account, yet my account remains frozen due to an ""unpaid disputed invoice status"". How can there be an unpaid disputed invoice when all invoices have been paid? This is an example of the incompetent Support provided by Temu. REGARDING TEMU'S CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, I WAS ON HOLD FOR 4 HOURS BEFORE ""TEMU"" CUT THE CALL.  LATER I CALLED TEMU CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 7:01 AM (HOURS OF OPERATIONS ARE FROM 7AM TO 11PM EST) AND WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT ON HOLD WITH NO RESPONSE. THESE ARE 2 EXAMPLES OF THE FACT THAT TEMU'S CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE SUPPORT IS NOT REAL AND EXIST IN APPEARANCE ONLY.************************************ Customer Service number does not work, a total waste of time. 3 times I attempted, waiting over an hour with no reply. Their online support was useless in addressing my issue....not listening and providing the same canned response.  Recently Temu began providing price adjustments via direct ""charge backs"" to customers credit cards (versus Temu account credits).  This led to Paypal freezing a payment to Temu for 21 days in that Paypal, in their ignorance, interpreted Temu as a charge back risk vendor.  Temu responded by freezing my account until Paypal released payment.  It is approaching a month and Temu refuses to ""unfreeze my account"" and continues to claim that that I am disputing charges, even though Paypal has finally released payment.  At this point....I have had enough of both Paypal and Temu.",1,16/02/2024

I personally would recommend it altho from personal experience, I?€?d not order clothes as the 3 clothes I?€?ve ordered have been polyester and I don?€?t care for it.

"I AM NOW EDITING THIS REVIEW TO CONFIRM THAT TEMU HAS REFUNDED THE AMOUNT REQUESTED. AFTER THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR TEAM, I AM RE-RATING MY EXPERIENCE, HOWEVER STILL LEAVING THE COMMENTS BELOW SO THAT THEY MAY HELP OTHER CUSTOMERS IN THE SAME SITUATION. I received an order on the 19 July and returned it on the 20 July. It was received by them on the 22 July. They will not refund due to the fact that I printed their free Evri label then realised there was no drop off point near where I live. It would not let me go back in to re-print a royal mail label. I therefore cut the address out of the label, and returned it by royal mail (at my own expense), putting sufficient information and an explanation in the parcel. I now have proof it was delivered but they have had to escalate for a **resolution**. So at the moment they have my goods to the value of 32.06 together with my money to the value of 32.06. I thought that this company was too good to be true and it seems I was right. I had no problems shopping with Shein, and Temu has now lost a good customer - which I have been over the past couple of months!! Very disappointed.

Socks have also all been surprisingly well made and only a couple quid for multiple pairs.

So I went down one more size. Still too big. Now, I should have realized earlier, but when I took a tape measure and checked their size, I found they were all identical in size, just with a different size label sewed inside.

"For the first impression, the company failed completely as on the first order my products were lost in transit. I got the refund but I was very disappointed. Yes, the prices are low, but only because they use the cheapest and worst delivery company, Evri. So if you wonder why your orders are messed up is because of that. Sorry to say it but Temu, you just lost a customer. Never ever I will order from you after this first unsuccessful order, unless by some miracle the items show up.

Its a complete con nothing but wish with some data farming mixed in god help you if you try to raise a complaint,1,19/02/2024
"Quick delivery and good communication on parcel whereabouts. Products are cheap and good value for the price- but don't think you are buying top quality. The pet hair remover I bought was unuseable because it was so rough it damaged the sofa fabric when dragged over it, and one of the dresses needed altering due to some weird shaping on the shoulders.",4,19/02/2024
"I was very sceptical at first as I never heard of this company that suddenly comes up whenever I searched a product, however thought I would give it a go as they accept PayPal. I'm glad I did, the items are decent for the price, one item came broken but requesting a refund was super easy barely an inconvenience.Only gripe is they use evri, but I guess they need to keep shippIng costs down.",4,19/02/2024
"I was skeptical at first, but I have ordered several times now. I have received everything I?€?ve paid. Most of the items were of decent quality. I will order again for sure. The only thing to watch for is sizes and measurements. Always read the details before purchasing.",5,19/02/2024
"Absolutely fantastic!I was very sceptical and despite all the adverts thrown at me via Facebook etc. did not ?€?buy into it?€? for months. A relative mentioned that they are using Temu and found it great so I put in my first order.Three orders later (to Devon UK) everything has arrived in perfect time and in great condition.I?€?m incredibly impressed and will be searching their website for anything I need before visiting the big chain stores!!Saves time, money, the frustration of parking and dealing with queues etc!!",5,20/02/2024
"I've had nothing but good products that meet their expectations from temu, my only complaint is when they advertise that your gonna get free items and in reality you don't, yoh have to refer people and also continue to buy other products in order to get what they claim are free gifts, then they have ads where other customers have won all these prizes and money, just to try and convince you to do the same, so the reason for this review is to tell consumers,  don't fall for the free items, they take you through so much to receive it.",4,20/02/2024
"I have placed 3 orders from this company. Each one came within the said time. I have been happy with everything, although I did have a couple of items that had a bit of damage. These issues were dealt with immediately, and I must say, I was very happy with the results.I recently received an order that had two of everything in the package. I was also charged twice on my credit card. It may have been my mistake, I'M not really sure.I filled out the refund for each item and was sent a return label. I the put the items back in the bag and taped it up with the label on it and took it to the UPS store the next day.I received an email within a few hours, and my credit card had the refund on it the next day. No questions, no blame, no problems.I also had to return an item to Walmart two days ago, and still haven't had the return put on my credit card.I don't know why others are having such issues, if they are not going through the proper procedures, if I've just been lucky, or if the site has improved over time. But from my experiences, I would definitely recommend Temu, and have already to a couple of people.",5,20/02/2024
"This company said they sent and delivered my package with LSO. Never heard of them and never received my package. I have a doorbell cam that literally says there is a package outside, a notification to my phone. Two days after the tracking said it was delivered I got a text from temu that it was delivered. Like? Where is my package? No one to reach out to they just submitted a ticket where I could provide info. Two days later it says closed because package was delivered will not refund or replace. Like what the? I am just so confused this has got to be a scam like I'm gonna get my $100 back but I'm sure there are a lot of people out there that don't have hours and hours to dispute and will just let it go. All that adds up for a Chinese company the dollar goes much further. Don't become victim to this scam like I did because you will spend hours and hours on hold only to have to dispute it with your credit card and wait months.",1,20/02/2024
my 3rd oder now on the way .I AM genuine!!! great VFM and delivery as good as the local courier!,5,20/02/2024
I was skeptical and doubtful to buy from Temu because of some negative reviews. Well I gave it a try and I couldn't believe the great quality and good products. I have already put another big order. Now I can't stop myself buying from Temu. Delivery is on time. I like the fact that they inform every step of shipping and customer service is great. I haven't ordered any garments so I can't give any review on that. What I bought so far I am very pleased with it.,5,20/02/2024
Great company with fantastic quality products at very reasonable prices with FREE delivery and FREE returns.Only been a customer for about three weeks and already had over 10 deliveries. Great customer service. Highly recommended.,5,20/02/2024
"I have used Temu twice and completely happy with the products.Unfortunately they use Evri for deliveries, the courier just leaves parcels in full view of the road for anyone to take. They never make any attempt to alert customers, ring the doorbell or leave in a safe place.  Waste of time to complain to Evri they appear to ignore all complaints or it is just total lack of interest.I will not be placing further orders with Temu and have requested my account to be deleted.If they use another courier, I will happily place further orders.  3 stars because of using Evri otherwise 5.",3,20/02/2024
"I have ordered from Temu once. The order arrived quickly, and for the price I paid for my total order, I was very satisfied. If you want high end quality, go to an over-priced boutique or the mall. Any online purchases can have flaws. I will definitely order from Temu again.",4,20/02/2024
"First time ordering from Temu. Certianly won't be the last. Fantastic communication from point of order to keeping you updated with delivery and tracking. They give you ??5 credit if the delivery which is a sign of a good company in my opinion. My order was on time, however which was great. The items I ordered where exactly as the photos. Sometimes on other sites things are photographed to make them look better than in real life but everything was true to the photos. I decided to buy just one item of clothing as in the past on similar sites, the sizing is ridiculously off and the fabric, which looks like t-shirt material in the photos end up being some horrible shiny cheap fabric. So, I was so happy that the top i ordered was not only true to size, but the material as shown in the photos. Really nice quality and will definitely be ordering more. All in all, this will now be my go to site. Love it.",5,20/02/2024
I?€?m really impressed with my order from Temu. It took 6 days to arrive and almost everything was exactly how it was described and what I wanted! One item was a bit useless but the same item is for sale on Amazon so I could easily have paid much more for the same thing! I would recommend Temu. Just read the product reviews and select items accordingly. Great!,5,20/02/2024
"Scam! DO NOT ORDER! No customer service!They were supposed to refund 2 orders over ??200, 3 separate packets under one label and one tracking. They are still dragging me saying they are working on it. I'm stuck between evri and temu and none of them are taking responsibility. I have provided all info on my side and they are being completely useless. Worst company ever! No customer service. DO NOT USE! SCAM!!! I did request a full return and returned the items!! it has been a month and still no refundPO-210-21427609047672824PO-210-21427590820472824DO NOT DELETE MY REVIEW!!!",1,20/02/2024
"Do not buy from here. I did an order of 10 completely different items and wasted every penny. I can't even say there was one item that had SOME quality to it. Jesus please please do not waste money. The quality is equivalent to items you win in machines or at kids fairs. Will never ever waste money there again. Items I bought for your ref: rug (terrible), hair extensions (so so thin and whispy) fidgets (most only good enough for the bin), lemon squeezer (so bad it's easier to hand squeeze defeating the object of a tool to help), fridge containers ( very sad plastic), wall hooks (look as cheap as they cost)Order Your Temu order confirmation (#PO-210-08026455122513855)And Your Temu order confirmation (#PO-210-08026455122513855)",1,21/02/2024
"First of all I?€?d like to say that this is NOT a fake review as some people seem to think on here. All I can say about Temu is I have bought a lot of stuff from them including clothes, car stuff, kitchen gadgets, holiday stuff. The first order I made was a small one mainly to make sure it wasn?€?t a scam, my order arrived within the time frame which impressed me & the things I ordered were good. So I have continued to buy from them, i especially like the clothes. They have all been of good quality, nice fabric & wash well. Received my latest order yesterday & again very happy.   I would recommend to give them a try. ???????€",5,21/02/2024
Spamming me to death with offers.Spammed my mobile number which you can't block or stop it sending you texts. No unsubscribe link.Downloaded the app and with 1 minutes of exiting the app. The app started spamming me notifications about offers.Never again will I order from Temu because I don't want the spam.I hate spam.,1,21/02/2024
Not sure why people are giving bad reviews on this company I?€?ve ordered multiple items and everything has arrived really quickly and the quality is just as good as the shops. The stuff is good.

"I bought Rayhong Headlight restoration kit from Temu. It destroyed my headlights. I contacted Temu. They gave me my money back for the product, I have to buy new Headlights now. Temu sells terrible products. It is going to cost me 218.00...buyer beware!!!",1,21/02/2024
Love their products and prices.only thing I hate is the constant emails/messages of spam.so called offers you can?€?t redeem.If they would stop that it would get 5 stars,3,21/02/2024
"Overall:Scams are present. You DO get the items you purchased at the PRICE quoted. BUT the scams are prevalent (see marketing below). Temu's biggest downfall and evil here is the MARKETING it conducts!Products:Generally campy and cheaply made. Some gems can be found however! You can find many of these products elsewhere, for sometimes less, or arriving sooner. Research your purchases! Getting it for $1 more in two days is better than several weeks for free sometimes. Shipping: Weeks! Slow! As in ""slow boat from China"". If it is late, you DO get a $5 credit on next purchase. This CAN happen often, and you do get a credit. Arrives in a plastic (orange) bag via USPS. Packaging of shipped items and product packaging is NOT good at all. Some of your items can and do get damaged in transit. Orders get sent in multiple packages for various reasons -resulting in late, missing, newer orders arriving faster than older orders, etc.Returns:Generally, you get a credit for the item if damaged or you do not like it. You don't send it back. You get ONE free return per order, and you must pay for others. Marketing (The SCAM part of Temu)The scams are everywhere! Only missing the side-show barker, Half Dog & half Cat, and the alligator boy! See the myriad of scams below.FREE SHIPPING... ignore the fake countdown. It is ALWAYS free and always has been since day one. The counter restarts over and over again. ^LIE^""ALMOST OUT OF STOCK"" & ""IN ""993 /random number/ OTHER CARTS!"" messages... Although sometimes, items do go out of stock while sitting in your cart, most of the time this lingers and festers in your cart (even for months)! seems improbable that that warning is honest and sincere! ^MOSTLY A LIE^ ITEM DESCRIPTIONS*... can be greatly misleading. Sometimes it is the result of poor attempts at translation. Very often you will find it is intentionally seemingly poor translation. Intended ambiguity. Avoid those items completely. Read carefully, and never assume. ^SOMETIMES A LIE^*NOTE on SIZING DESCRIPTIONS:Sizing is an area that is problematic. Asian, African, European and N. and S. Americas all have different sizing. Remember, you are purchasing from a global (Asian mostly) market and research accordingly. If you do not, you will regret it! LICENSED PRODUCTS:A GREAT many of the listed products are not licensed. Look for some variations in logo and spelling (for the obvious) and sometimes flat out (not obvious) fakes. This is a problem online elsewhere as well and is a global market problem. This is not just a Temu or China issue. It is very prevalent, however. ^TOO OFTEN A LIE^GAMES: All games are a scam. Just like those traveling carnivals, these things are rigged! You select free items (and coupons or cash) and are presented with a goal (and a mini game) to reach that goal. Feeding fish for example. You earn grams of food to feed the fish by buying items (minimum order) or inviting friends and family into Temu.  It starts out fine. It is even easy. You will start calculating how quickly you will earn your reward! Spending real money and inviting everyone you know! Exponentially getting less and less in return until finally the timer reaches zero. You are welcome to try. Some DO spend enough and anger friends and family enough to get something over a span of about a month (every single day, grinding away). Diminishing returns and compounded in game cost. Most people will not know enough people, or spend enough time, money, and hound friends enough to get what amounts to $20-30 in ""prizes"". Games get difficult after you have given up all of your friends/family and made multiple purchases. The prospect of winning dries up just before the finish line.  ^NOT A LIE BUT CALCULATED AGAINST YOU-AND SEEMINGLY FAIR AT START^INVITATIONS:Rewards for invitations in games are borderline fraudulent! However, NEW customers DO get great coupons (with minimum purchases)! They do tend to dry up after you have proven (and purchased) to be a good customer. Those great savings and coupons disappear. ^NOT A LIE ` for new customers ^NOTIFICATIONS:You will get these daily and in multiples. .99 cent deals, 60% off... blah, blah, blah. You will very often see these ""deals"" at these same prices all of the time.  Would not be a lie, if the ""MSRP"" was ever in play. It is not in my experience. Ever.  ^LIE^A NOTE on the LIE and marketing:This is my PERSONAL opinion.I firmly believe that some of what I consider (As an American) fraudulent and borderline fraudulent marketing practices is based upon MY personal experience as well as my societal norm in my country. I am aware of other views on what is fair and good marketing that differ from mine.  It is fair and proper to haggle a price at the bazaar in Istanbul. I cannot get away with or do so at a Walmart in Ohio!",2,21/02/2024

I ordered 4 things arrived on time no problem with Two of the things but the clothes are not good . Both the same size one too big one too small . The pictures look nice but the real article completely different . No shape at all in one just a long tube . Material ok . The smaller of the two waist line too high up on my chest and too short.

"Temu does have good prices on many items and their selection is huge. Shipping times are just a little long because items are shipped from warehouses around the world. BUT! They use misleading photos and quantity descriptions in some cases and it is hard to know what you are buying. Could be a language thing but I?€?m starting to feel it is a false advertising thing. Also, I have reviewed several items with one being a negative review. That review was discarded by Temu. Now for a pet peeve. People write 5 star reviews as soon as they receive an item, and before they even try the item. Useful IDGITS!",3,23/02/2024

"2 Orders from Temu.I have ordered twice from Temu and have mixed feelings. The products I ordered all arrived undamaged within the delivery timeline Temu gave me and were of good quality. I really like the product quality and low pricing. The items were all from different categories.However, I'm frustrated with Temu's 'free gift/money' system. The app will always give you a 'jackpot' or 'platinum reward' every time you spin, and inviting friends / playing mini-games / clicks on referral codes only gets you so far in the free gift 'bar'. It will generally not let you progress once you're really close, or actions that would regularly give you multiple dollars towards the reward will suddenly be worth 5 cents towards the reward. The rewards offered are generally anywhere from 100 dollar gifts to 800 dollar gifts, oftentimes offering to send the money straight to your Paypal account. Overall, although I appreciate the items I have bought, anytime I was offered free gifts or money I found it to be a scam or at least very deceptive.",3,23/02/2024

Never play their games to get free items. I was playing the games more than 2 months but when I was around %99 they did not extend my deadline which they were doing all other times.

"Here's an update to my review. I was contacted by trustpilot because temu responded saying they need clarification of my review, could I please do so or my review would be deleted. I just sent the exact same review. I didn't change anything. One because I didn't know how to add anything separately to it for explanation. Their response back, I should go to their website and look for helpful suggestions or contact them directly. I almost hit the ceiling. The whole point of my negative review was the fact that you couldn't do any of that. Unbelievable The AI at its best... we're screwed people. This is just the beginning I don't know why I am running into all these issues with artificial intelligence but it's a nightmare You all don't realize it yet but it's a nightmare that is going to get worse Am I the only one that feels Temu is annoying? I was trying to research a product source and went to their site. Within seconds as I started to look at the site a gaming wheel popped up.  Not intested in playing any games.  But you can't get rid of it.  It follows you.  Then the coupons come.  Then messages.  How can you shop if you wanted too?  I had it. Done.  They are about to get a piece of my mind!  How stupid am I, of course you can't reach them.  I realized the site is a rip off of DHgate just more pricey. Stop thinking we are so distracted by this crap.  I wouldn't buy from them if they had ecaxtly what I wanted for free.",1,24/02/2024

Cheap..yes, but also problematic as some clothing items flimsy / tacky / thin meterial.Refund no problem , but Return's not easy, as not near a courier drop off centre and don't drive.  Would not recommend.  Re edited / updated. Orders may of been may , not June. Have too much on to go back re checking.

I ordered a drone for my granddaughter's birthday. The packaging was merely a plastic bag with zero protection - no outer box or polystyrene protection.  Of course it arrived crushed but too close to the birthday to exchange.  Will never use Temu again.,1,24/02/2024

"I had never heard of Temu until a friend told me about it, and now I am quite 'addicted' to it. Huge range at low prices with free postage - loads of 'gadgets' and 'goodies' that I didn't know existed. My wife and I have placed many orders and on the odd occasion of a wrong item colour or damage etc we were refunded within minutes when we uploaded photos. Quality has been good but does vary with price - you get what you pay for, read the item reviews if there are any or just chance it at those prices. Delivery is quite fast considering it is from China and you can track your order easily. Anyone moaning about all the notifications should try turning them off in the app maybe? I did. Give them a try - and if you are happy let the world know on here - it helps others make an informed choice.",5,25/02/2024
"Temu does NOT deliver on time and cannot keep their promises. Please read articles about this on Google. They have done this to UK and US so it won?€?t make a difference where you order from. 5?? credit for a late delivery or alas no delivery it is nothing as they keep the funds for a period of time for thousands of users, hence they have money to roll with, which should be illegal, as the costumers will gain interest should they keep that money in a bank for this period of time. Not to mention the inconvenience of needing the items and having to wait for your own money to be able to order again from a genuine website. The delivery partner they chose : EVRI, is as reliable as Temu. They have extremely bad reviews on any website and will NOT deliver the parcels although the tracking shows it?€?s been in their depot for quite a while and the status of the order MUST change within 24hrs . Do not waste your money or time on them ! Choose wisely.",1,25/02/2024
"I do not recommend shopping at Temu, the materials are artificial and the size of the things bought there will disappoint you, I waited almost 3 weeks for the shipment, the agent I contacted was not helpful at all I had the feeling that I was talking to a robot",1,25/02/2024
"Some products are to good to be true, but believe me i have been purchasing from temu quite regularly and it is a legit website.  At times its a hit or miss in terms of product quality but then thats acceptable given the low price tags",5,25/02/2024
Amazing quality for the prices. The only downside is you have to be patient for your delivery and packaging isn?€?t great. The savings and quality products are well worth it in my opinion.,5,25/02/2024
"Misleading PromotionsAn ad appeared on my email from this company for a foldable trolley for ??3.99 from ??34.99. I clicked the link to download the app and upon so doing the trolley was priced at ??34.99 so of course I did not purchase it, especially you can buy the same trolley for less than ??34.99 on Amazon. When I raised it with Temu, they stated that as I placed an order before ordering it, it was no longer available at that price - SCAMPointless VouchersWhen I placed my order, I immediately received some vouchers to use against future purchases. As this was my first order, with a company I've never heard of nor are they based in the UK, I didn't even bother to look at the vouchers but elected to wait until my order actually arrived. When I checked the vouchers, they had expired well before my order had arrived. In fact they lasted only 4 days. Who in their right mind would make further purchases until their first order arrived. Furthermore, if Temu was confident in its selling process, it would, like all other sellers, at least have the vouchers lasting 30 days. - DUBIOUSSellersI ordered two items and when they arrived, one matched the actual description whilst the other did not. It was supposed to be a plain black cargo short trouser but it turned out to be a shinny checked black pair - looked awful. When I drew this to the attention of Temu, their response was, oh never mind, we can help you with the return. I sent them photos of the actual material that arrived and pictures of the trousers advertised - they did nothing. Worse still, this item is being sold by various sellers under different names, using the same pictures etc. This leads me to believe its the same individual that has created numerous seller accounts in order to dupe customers.Fake ReviewsThe cargo shorts looked nothing like the pictures displayed by the seller yet when you look at the reviews (I wish I had looked at them before ordering) you see all these 5 star reviews with customers saying how pleased they are with their purchase. Some even holding up the cargo shorts which of course bares no resemblance to the actual item which they ordered. Now, why would you say your are happy with your purchase when the item is totally different to that which you thought you were buying. All the five star review make no mention of the difference in material. Its only when you look at the 1 and 2 star reviews that you note them complaining about the difference in what they believed they were buying and that which arrived. Furthermore, Temu place all the 5 star reviews at the top of the listing and hide the 1 and 2 star reviews in the middle, so that they are hard to locate. SCAMCustomer ServiceWhen you raise an issue, they revert back to you with the same response over and over again, as if your communicating with a robot.In SummationThey have loads of choice but for me this company due to the way it operates and its lack to verify its sellers, is just not worth dealing with.",1,25/02/2024

Great Prices / great choice - Delivery can take a while to arrive but to date after 3 orders - these have all been within the range of dates advised (If it does exceed the range then they will give you some credit on your account). A BBQ cover i received was not water-tight and the refund was very fast - I just took a couple of pictures of the product and described the fault then you can have instant Temu credit (or wait 5 days for a refund back to your card). The App is quite annoying constantly giving promotional messages so I usually uninstall it or force stop it to keep it quiet when not looking to buy anything. Apart for that the experience has been very good and the prices are amazing on some products (3-4 times cheaper than Ebay / Amazon in many cases),4,25/02/2024
"UPDATE: Temu sent me the same canned answer as they send everyone who complains. They do not care about customer satisfaction, they did not refund me in full, they did not reach out to me. This is nothing more than a cut and paste that they do for anyone who complains. A big fat lie, and a big fat scam.*****This is a big, fat scam!  Do not waste your money if you are ordering from the USA. I placed one order, my first and my last.  They sent me a damaged and USED water bottle. They sent me stationery that is wrinkled and bent. They sent me razors that are dull and dangerous. They sent me scrapbooking papers that are cheap and useless. I raised such a stink with them via their chat, and thankfully, was refunded immediately.  I am sick of these Chinese companies ripping off customers.  It's a scam and a joke! You've been warned.",1,26/02/2024

I have ordered loads of things from here and always been happy with my stuff but put 2 orders in a couple of weeks ago and still not recieved my orders which I ain?€?t very happy about thinking of stopping ordering anymore as all the app says from evri is they still waiting for them which one parcel was supposed to be delivered from the 23rd hmm we will see how long it takes for my second order as from yje 25th,5,26/02/2024
"Due to my order not being delivered , no fault of the company , I had to contact customer services at Temu. After a lengthy wait to try resolve I was told they could not send outMy order again as the items were out of stock. I reluctantly agreed to a refund to be told it would take 5-14 days to come through and was tried to be direct to taking Temu credit as it was credited quicker. After agreeing to the 5-14 day wait I looked on the site and every single item I had ordered was actually in stock and offering fast delivery so I am massively disappointed with the service provided as they could have simply reissued my order.",2,26/02/2024

I have been requesting an answer and the refund for the past 12 DAYS, but can only get a bot that repeats it has been referred to a supervisor. The worst customer service experience.

"Artists copyright infringements?Temu has since removed my review twice now just because I don't want to send information to prove that I've made purchases, but you've annoyed me enough now so I'll send you the correct information next time I'll get an email telling me to actually prove myself that I was a customer. So here we go yet again, I purchased a few items, I ordered some stickers and they were really badly printed and so dull looking (I ordered a lot of stickers from different sellers via Temu) and most of them are just duplicates also they take designs from Etsy and Instagram. I also ordered an ornament which looked okay I guess a bit smaller but that's fine, however it was 3D printed as I can tell. Ordered other things too, again they were okay and not as good in the images, but that's a given for being cheap tat.I did receive them all and it wasn't too long waiting for delivery which was good.However the issues I have and I feel strongly against this, is the fact that Temu on their shops use a LOT of people's images/designs as I recognise a LOT of them. Did they ask for permission? I'm going to say no. It's really disappointing and very disheartening to see this happening more and more recently. It's actually disgusting that you can't think of your own stuff to create and sell. Would I use Temu again? They keep deleting my review, well you already know my answer then. Shop like a billionaire they say? I think billionaires buy better stuff to be honest. Temu is a company that is obsessed with advertising and perfect for materialistic people who think they need all this cheap tat. Goodbye ????",1,26/02/2024
Delivery drivers are lazy and left my order on the building porch even tho i asked them second time to call me or bring it up to my flat. So it ended up stolen again. I am so pleased with Glutas he was so patient and helpful doing the refund process. Temu should change their delivery company as evri is useless..,4,26/02/2024
"My family have been using Temu for months now and they are a great company to deal with with a few caveats.Prices are unbelievable, often on Amazon at 2-3x price. Quality ranges from OK to surprisingly good, certainly great value. Range is enormous but same item sometimes listed more than once with different price and named source supplier so check.Delivery has always been as promised and their go to for us is Evri (tracking never confirms day of delivery which is irritating but that's Evri). Packaging has always been a plastic bag with items tightly packed together. Occasional breaks as a result but minimal AND Temu refund immediately without issue. Excellent customer service.You'll get many emails and offers every day but that's the deal. Just ignore or read! So certainly NOT a scam and a great option in my view.",5,26/02/2024

"Ok let's be honest, we all know what we're dealing with here.. cheap, quickly made, fast fashion type goods.If you don't know, basically similar to Shein. This a giant of a company that provides you with anything you can think of for a cheaper price then you're likely to find it elsewhere.While I am sure people would all claim that they would rather not support this kind of thing. We're all in the same boat and need to get products at the most affordable price, because everyone is skint.Overall I've never had a problem with Temu, their customer service is actually pretty good and the live chat seems to always be open.Are there some scam products on there? heck yeah... are there low quality products on there? sure... but you can still grab good quality bargains.Here's my top tips for making it work.Read the description well.Look at the measurements before buying.If it's too good to be true, then it is! eg. If it's a ??100 product for ??10... it's not likely to be genuine.Read the reviews.Use your gut, if your gut is saying ""hmm I think that will be rubbish"" then don't buy it.I've bought so much on here and out of the 50+ orders I've done, I've only had two products that were no good. One was a dress (I don't know what sort of thing they used to make it but it was like it wasn't designed for a human to wear) but that was refunded straight away as a no-return. Just instant refunded and I also had a problem with an electrical good that battery didn't work (returned free postage)It's overall really not that bad, but as I said just be careful what goods you choose to buy.",5,27/02/2024
"Update:  Received response from Temu:?€? Temu credits will appear in your Temu credit balance within 3 minutes and can be used immediately. If you choose to receive your refund back to your original payment method, please allow 5-14 business days for it to appear since timing depends on your financial institution. ?€?They LIE. I submitted my return on Tuesday, have a receipt to prove it and there is ZERO credit in my account 48 hours later. I asked for a credit not to my debit/bank card. But to my Temu account. So once again I will state that it will be a miracle if I ever get the credit. PLUS, they didn?€?t even address my comment!  I don?€?t think they even read these just send out automated replies.  What a load of crap. ?€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€??€?I just sent in my returns. I asked for a credit on my account which they said will happen within 3 minutes. Ha!  Not. What they actually mean is 3 minutes from the time they receive , inspect it and ?€?approve?€? if you deserve the refund. It will be a miracle if I actually get the credit. So sad. I was super excited about Temu but I just don?€?t trust them and will not make any further orders. I figure I have lost about $150 in this scam. The products are total crap.  Don?€?t order unless it?€?s simple stuff that you don?€?t really care about. My little pill holder and toothbrush holder are great!  Total cost about $4.

"Temu failed again. Their courier received my parcel.Then updates stop. Three days have gone by and Temu, normal to type have done nothing. They did raise a ticket, but empty promises of supervisors contacting me and appointing someone to manage the issues.Lots of empty promises and platitudes. Zero progress. I on the other hand have copied the CEO and executive office of the courier and got information.I have been told by them that the parcel was sent back to Temu, until the CEO got involved and now by magic, they are searching the local branch.Watch this space because if the courier company doesn?€?t find it, I will be posting on their failure. However as they seem to be helping, unlike Temu. I will give them more time.Wait for the standard cut and paste response from Temu and enjoy. If you ever do use this company. Be warned! If your delivery goes wrong, you are on your own. They have a special clock that defaults to 48 hours and then resets if you are bold enough to ask what is going on. The 15 day SLA is another one. They obviously use customers as a free bank.Please note this is incident 2, just in case you think this is a repeat of the previous mess upUPDATE - as predicted we got the standard cut and paste with pointless platitudes.

When the rest of the world makes clothing in my case particularly ""shirts""  when looking for a larger shirt the size of the shirt itself changes not just the label. So just to recap if you have a large shirt putting a 5 or 6 xl label in it doesn't alter the size of the shirt, just saying I hope this helps.

Pretty but cheaply made and no support in them whatsoever. As a keen SHEIN shopper, I was very disappointed.",3,29/02/2024
"The solar lights ordered do not charge up at all, even with 6 full hours of sun. Since writing the original review, I have since replaced the rechargeable batteries and the lights are now working. But I?€?m afraid The pet brush does not adequately remove my cat?€?s hair.",1,29/02/2024
"Went on the site, where I spun the wheel and won ??100 for my next shop. Had to buy 4 items from a select list of mainly trash. Spent like ??14. After the order, didn't get my coupon like it said. Spoke to customer service, who ridiculously offered me 20% off. How absurd! From ??100 spending to only 20% off. Don't buy from them. Lots of scam tactics to trick you into making an order. I've now cancelled it for a full refund and will never be using their services again.",1,29/02/2024
"Scam!!!! You're suckered in by bright colours and cheap items, but the quality of the product is poor. Ordered 3 pairs of shoes and they turned up all squashed together and ruined.

"Pathetic shipping and customer service. I ordered something as a gift on 9th July and it's 23rd July today and I am still chasing - both Temu and the delivery partner. It's like a ping pong game going on. They try to lure you with a 5?? credit but that is also added to Temu account which means that you will need to re-order to avail that. I received 2parcels earlier, products were ok but the experience I had on my other parcel for delivery, it's highly disappointing.",1,29/02/2024
"Watch out for the good reviews begging you to get the app, it is spammed with malware and it will mess up your phone as well as giving them literally all your information.

"All these people complaining about how their $5 handbag doesn't compare to a $1,500 handbag need a reality check. Know what you are looking for and don't expect the world. This site is for useful items but not luxury items... comfy house clothes, check, high quality brand items... go elsewhere. I've found amazing sleepwear (and oh so cute!) useful household items and pet items for a fraction of the price of Amazon. Their return policy is great! Sure I have to learn patience and wait a week or two, but if it allows me to go crazy shopping  without burning a hole in my pocket, I say it's worth it!",5,29/02/2024

Was sceptical at first and ordered the minimum. Very pleasantly surprised. Not the quickest but if you're that desperate use Amazon. Have since made many orders and on the whole have been happy with all. Was given a ??5 credit because a delivery was late and didn't even realise it was. Also had to return some shoes and noted that you got a free return and asked for credit to my account which was immediate. Then received a message stating I could keep the item. Very pleased,5,01/03/2024

"Have ordered twice from Temu now and haven't had a problem. I have not ordered clothing so can't comment on that. All I would say is to make sure you read the description of each item carefully (I think many of the reviewers on here wouldn't have had such a negative experience if they had) and check out the reviews. I personally don't use the app, I'd rather go through the website.",4,01/03/2024
I loved every single item especially the water bottles.  Definitely will do it again,5,01/03/2024
I think the customer service is outstanding. I?€?ve returned a few items with no issues: credit is fast: delivery time and tracking is excellent. I occasionally have got the wrong size but returned as I liked the item - and the price is fabulous! The only criticism I have is that some pants are short but the size guide helps.,5,01/03/2024
Can't fault them. The prices are great as is the choice of things to buy. The delivery time is realistic and acceptable and is clearly stated at the time of placing the order. I have made several orders so far and have been happy with the shopping experience. Only one time was there a problem with one item and that was sorted out very quickly and without fuss or any quibbling.  Overall I would be happy to recommend this site based on my own shopping experience.,5,01/03/2024
"I've just been reading the reviews.  I only discovered Temu a couple of months ago.  1.  Always buy through Topcashback because there is a discount there.  2.  Be selective in what you buy.  The prices are unbelievably good and in some cases the goods are amazing value.  In others, not so much, so be careful what you order.  Last delivery for me was 5 different dresses, some makeup and a couple of tops.  ??50 the lot.  The dresses will be brilliant for my upcoming holiday in the sun and on average at ??6 each they are amazing.  I am a size 26 and they are true to size, so I have no complaints - just be carefull.  This is not a scam site - yes the goods come from China, are not very well packed, but they represent good value for money, so be patient and choose wisely!",4,01/03/2024
"Excellent quality, true to size, received my order within a week. Definitely using Temu from now on.",5,01/03/2024
I just wished id thought it through before spending that it all seemed to be too good to be true. I ordered art work that i thought was cheap but nice art for office walls when it turned up its like cheap rolled up wallpaper even if i wanted to frame it would cost me hundreds in frames for the size of the artwork when 5 pictures 3 wall art metal designs & 2 wall clocks turn up in a orange jiffy bag you know you been conned!!! Oh well its my last order with these folks how can i now trust what I'm ordering is what I'll get..... no where did i see the artwork wasnt in frames as shown in the pictures and no where did i see it say NO FRAMES !!,1,01/03/2024

Items were yes cheap but for the price very good an works perfectly. nothing was broken , everything was packed very well. I do always read reviews of other people specially with pictures ,so you know what you are getting exactly. Best part was that you were able to pay with Klarna, and i trust klarna, so i didnt have to give my banking to nobody but klarna. and if there is a problem i can always contact Klarna. I do recomend Temu just make sure you are reading reviews and feedback. :)",4,02/03/2024

"I bought a shirt. I wear 4xl but the 4xl from temu was not a 4xl. So I ask for help. They jumped right into action to help me. They gave me a temu credit.

"Lost my package twice. Would not refund my second one they lost because they kept saying it was in transit but when I checked the courier link, it said it was delivered and they attached pictures of the packages, but it was not my house at all. Both the courier (Piggyship) and temu would not acknowledge that they dropped off my package at the wrong house and would not issue my refund and kept stating that it was still in transit/that it was delivered to the correct address.They are still currently pushing the notion that I put in the wrong address for my order, even though I have confirmed with them multiple times that whenever they have delivered my package to is not the address I provided them. Fully blame the customers instead of taking responsibility. Would not let me speak to a supervisor and will end the chat if I am inactive for a couple minutes but will leave me on hold for 20 minutes at a time. I have photo evidence that they provided that my package is at the incorrect address and provided pictures of my address and yet they continue to insist that it is in transit or been correctly delivered.",1,02/03/2024
Horrible customer serviceOrder has been delayed. Nothing credited. Nobody is willing to take the responsibility . Ive been asked to keep chasing the courier company.

"Dear Temu supportI am writing to bring to your attention an unfortunate and frustrating experience I have had with my recent order through the Temu App. About a month ago, I placed an order for a dress and a pair of AirPods for my wife. However, despite patiently waiting for the delivery, I have not received the items to this day.According to the tracking information provided by the EVRi delivery company, the order has purportedly arrived in my city. However, much to my dismay, the drivers have not made any attempts to deliver the items to my address. I have taken the initiative to visit the delivery company's office and have engaged in multiple conversations with their customer service team, but each time, I have been met with empty promises and no tangible resolution.In response to my plight, I contacted the Temu customer service seeking help. I must express my appreciation for their understanding, as they promptly issued a refund for the order due to the extended delay in delivery. They also informed me that I could keep the items once they are finally delivered, considering the excessive delay. However, this approach presents a significant issue because the delivery company has never managed to fulfill the delivery, leaving me without the much-needed items.I earnestly believe that Temu should reevaluate their association with this delivery company, as their inefficiency has significantly impacted your company's reputation in the UK. As a testament to the dissatisfaction experienced by customers, the Temu App's customer rating has plummeted to an abysmal 1.1 on the Trustpilot review website.I implore you to take immediate action to resolve this matter and restore my faith in the services provided by Temu App. I still require the dress and AirPods, and I am hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be reached promptly.I look forward to your urgent response and a resolution to this matter.",4,03/03/2024
"I was somewhat dubious given the quality of their ads and the cheapness of the items but decided to bite the bullet and buy some craft items.

"Been a customer for over a month now and have had 3 order delivered with 2 on their way. Delivery has been consistantly on time. Things are delivered in tightly packaged parcels but nonetheless they come in great quality. Things definitely mostly represent their price, if you buy a bag for 3 pound, you will get a bag that's worth 3 pound. That is to be expected. However, some shops do sell cheap things on offer and they're better quality than that of the cost. Ive had to ask to return a few things but I have been refunded straight away with no need to return (unless required to by the store). Overall, I am very happy with the store. Also, the scams people speak of make no sense, as I haven't had any issues at all, they even provide live shipping updates.",5,03/03/2024
"Awesome on line store.I absolutely love this site.I constantly order from them.95% of the items are great quality. Their clothing materials are good quality & some of them are nice & soft.Their prices are amazing, especially with the cost of living crisis in the UK right now.This Xmas will be affordable for me & many others ???€Their shipping is very quick considering the distance the items come from.This is definitely my go-to site.I love the discounts, offers & freebies too. I will continue to take advantage of these, as I currently always do.I have already praised them on here, but I think they deserved more recognition, especially for people who don't have a huge bank account.Their refund/returns are so simple to use & your refunds are quick.Awesome online store with 1000s of products.

There is a company masquerading as temu. They are sending people packages that they did not order and charging for them. We have received seven packages so far that we did not order that are showing up on our credit card. So far Temu has not been very helpful.,1,03/03/2024
"I am new to Temu and in the first few weeks, I spent/ordered well in excess of ??200 worth of mainly t-shirts. Because of the amount I am ordering, I am only opening the packets when I need them. In one of the original orders I sent an item back because of poor-quality stitching, this was free postage as they state you get one free return. I assumed that was because of a change of mind, I didn't think this applied to faulty goods.Come forward a couple of weeks and out of the same consignment another shirt has a pull line across the chest. I naturally try to return it, but they want me to pay ??2.50 postage on a faulty item they sent me, so I thought that I would speak to customer service (Micah from now on) and get it sorted out. I must have spent well over an hour on chat going backward and forwards trying to explain to them that if they trade in the UK, which they do, they have a physical building in Birmingham that they have to follow the Sale and Supply of Goods Act. In a nutshell, a product has to be Free from Damage and of Merchantable Quality and Durable Construction. After the first 1/2 hour, I reminded them that I had over ??100 of open orders which I would be willing to cancel, an order that had already shipped worth around ??30.00 would be returned upon receipt, and that my relationship with Temu would come to an end. The long and short was that as far as they are concerned, Temu's Policy trumps UK Trading Law in that, I had to pay return postage for a faulty item they sent me. So, I voted with my feet. I canceled all open orders and will be returning orders in transit to my home.If you are ok taking a chance and checking every order as soon as it gets delivered then fine, but if they don't respect UK Law then what else may they do?Buyer Beware!Update,As Temu has confirmed in their reply below, only the first return is free just as I stated. Regardless of if you find a problem with another garment from the same shipment later on, as far as they are concerned, the customer pays for each garment's return postage for anymore faulty goods. That just isn't legal as far as I am aware.This company needs to be stopped from flouting UK trading law.So, I will say again, Buyer Beware!2nd UpdateI have received an email from Trustpilot informing me that Temu 'Don't think this review is based on a genuine experience', well, I can assure you it is.Trustpilot is threatening to remove this review unless I can prove the above.Temu has already fulfilled part of this in their last reply where I pointed out their confirmation of only accepting one return paid for by them, regardless of if you find another garment that has a fault where they then make the customer pay the return postage. (The first return for each order is free and you can choose to receive your refund back to your original payment method or as Temu credits). I will try and find some kind of proof other than what I have just quoted directly from their reply below, but to be called a liar by Temu is slander surely?Update 13th Oct 2023,I submitted several pieces of evidence to Trustpilot. They looked at all the evidence I submitted and agreed that I was telling the truth and Temu was being less than truthful.In light of this Trustpilot has upheld my complaint and allowed me to keep this review to hopefully guide other potential customers.",1,03/03/2024

So far so good. I've ordered a few times now and items have always been delivered before the expected date. Won a couple of free items too so bonus. I'd highly recommend them to anyone.If you choose to play the games for free items be warned that the games are frustrating and can take a long time to complete but that's to be expected I think as your free gifts are dependent on your referrals.,5,04/03/2024

He purchased the most random things, water pistols, neck chain, sun glasses, gel blaster gun etc... I looked at the final price and was like ""that is not going to arrive"".  But it did and all as described. He has used it 3 times and everything came and on time. They do offer discounts and the more you use the app the higher the prices seem to go but it is good fun, not expensive and always a highlight to see what arrives.  We gather round the table to see all the swag and it has turned into quite a fun experience for us all.  Just note when you pay 99p for a chunky gold chain, don't expect a 18ct gold chain to up, you get a metal chain that he loves and then loses in a week (kids for you)...",5,05/03/2024

"I have received my order finally. Even though one of the shirts were oversized, but they refunded me without me having to return the shirt. They actually refunded me and told me not to return the shirt. They are doing well in terms of customer service, but there is one thing they need to look at seriously. I suggest they should have an optional courier service where a customer can choose his preferred courier. CTT is not helping Temu and other shopping apps. Ctt will not contact a customer for his delivery if the parcel can?€?t be kept inside the mailbox, they will leave a card in your mailbox. And if you are someone who does not check your mailbox regularly, by the time you see and trace it, they will tell you they have returned the items. So please have courier service like dhl, fedex, ups. Anyone who preferred to choose either one of this would choose it as his preferred courier even if it comes up with extra charges.",5,05/03/2024
"Recently, my family downloaded an app via a link promising a ??35 voucher. Despite downloading it, he were informed that he were not eligible for the voucher. When I reached out to customer service to address the problem, they were unable to offer any assistance, providing only a 20% discount, which proved to be of no use.Edit: the customer service contacted me and solved the issue quickly",5,05/03/2024
"Having gone to the help section to resolve the supply of an incorrect product I was referred to a named  ""person"" who would deal with my problem. After a series of exchanges with ""Her"" I realized that I was dealing with an AI that was pre=programmed to provide stock answers. The end result of numerous exchanges was a response to have the issue referred to a senior party who would investigate the matter and get back to me in due course. Having received no further contact I can only assume that Temu has stopped communicating with me and have no intention of correcting the supply of the wrong product. The whole experience has been very frustrating. Whilst the company appears a very slick operation and apparently satisfies most of its customers I would never use Temu again. Hank Laan AM.

"I am always very sceptical when buying from an online company that I have never used before. I checked Trustpilot before I even considered ordering anything from Temu, and found that their score was 3.4 out of 5 stars. I decided to give Temu a chance, and I was very glad that I did!I have now ordered several items from Temu and each and every one has been exactly as described, arrived within their expected delivery time (approx. 7-10 days), securely packaged and wrapped well.I ordered a pair of jog pants for my partner, but when they arrived, they were too small (my mistake). However, my partner (who is quite fussy) was very happy with the material, elasticated drawstring waist and pockets. I decided to return them and was very pleasantly surprised how easy it was. In fact, I didn't even have to send them back, but still got an instant refund! Brilliant! N.B. This is not the case for every return though!If you are thinking of giving Temu a try, please do. I was happy with my purchases, but admit that I haven't purchased from every single category so cannot comment on those items, but if they are anything like the items I did buy, I would be a satisfied customer.I have since placed 2 further orders (minimum spend of ??15, but with free delivery) and very much look forward to continuing to buy from Temu again.It is fair to say that no matter where you buy from online or in store, and no matter what the company, high end or economical (I don't like to use the word ""cheap"", you may experience problems from time to time. So just because the prices on Temu are very affordable for most people, doesn't mean that the service they provide for their customers isn't of the highest standard, which for me, has been the case.Have a little faith and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",5,05/03/2024
"My experience with Temu has been excellent. I do read through descriptions and look at pictures very carefully so I know what to expect, and am realistic about quality for the pricesOnly had one issue with item. It was a 99p soap dish with a faulty suction cup and I was refunded immediately.Quality may vary, like with other online marketplaces, but I consider everything I've bought excellent value.Everything has arrived within a week, with detailed tracking from picking, through to airport customs clearance, then links to UK courier tracking.",5,05/03/2024
"I can honestly say without a shadow of exaggeration, this is the worst shopping experience I?€?ve had in 58 years on planet earth. I have never been so frustrated. In brief I bought a watch which had a defective  strap. I returned it, the shipment has been with Evri for over two weeks. They have promised me a refund, lied to me and never processed one, they said Paypal are to blame and it goes on and on. You literally go around in circles as the agents are powerless to do anything, they refer to asupervisor who sends you the exact same thing that was sent before. I wouldn?€?t buy a paper clip from them again. The bank said they will credit me after 14 days so I will get my money back, but honestly what a sham.look at Temu?€?s response to see what I meannot only have i sent them the order number which they?€?ve asked for and ignored but the item was returned fir a refund over two weeks ago. Are they incompetent or is this a way of never giving you your money back . Never have I been more frustratedUpdate; eventually Paypal helped me and gave me my money back taken about 6 weeks!",1,05/03/2024
"I've ordered twice and have been delighted with the items. The price is fabulous, the quality varies between each item so do read all the descriptions. I have received 4 dresses that are my absolute favourite and a couple of 'plasticky' ones that I'm not so sure about.  Household items do the job they are supposed to.",5,05/03/2024
"Ordered some items, parcel on Evri shows delivered, however when I got home parcel was  ot there - no neighbours had taken it in nor family members - emailed Evri who confirmed parcel was left in unsafe location so must have been stolen, Temu refuse to refund my money on items I do not have!!! I've sent screenshots of emails from Evri which confirm the parcel was left in an unsafe place. Been in touch number of times no further forward! All I want is my money back or a replacement.",1,05/03/2024
"I have been purchasing from Temu for a few months already and have not had a bad experience at all.  Everything I've purchased so far has been of great quality.  Also, my orders very seldom take more than 5 days to reach me and I have never paid for shipping.  Soooo, I am very satisfied and do not really care if it's a Chinese company...isn't everything else we deal with here in the States?  Even where my husband retired from Smithfield Packing (he was a truck driver).",5,06/03/2024

"The company are an utter swindle. They offer copious amounts of rewards, coupons, prizes, voucher codes, freebies, etc. and all they are trying to do is get you to refer as many friends as possible to try and swindle them too. You think you're getting to a reward limit so you can ""withdraw to PayPal"" then the minimum limit increases and you have to keep trying to dupe more people into signing up. It's not a pyramid scheme, it's worseThe app has a constant barrage of ""offers"" pop up and make it almost impossible to even search for items. Then when you finally do, it's mostly cheap, poor quality tat, copycat items from other companies and borderline copyright infringement.Some very underhand and dubious tactics used by this company, so a warning to all: You know that phrase ""if it looks too good to be true, it probably is"" is all I can leave you with.",1,06/03/2024
i ordered 2 shirts from TEMU even though the items arrived 1 day late they were a good fit and good quality.And TEMU credited my account with ??5 because of the delayed arrival.So for sure i will be shopping with TEMU again.,5,06/03/2024
"What can I say some products I ordered were ok but most things i have ordered are great , the price difference compared to a major well know site I normally use ( yes next day delivery) at a membership cost ! Realised the price difference between Temu and other site is substantial to say the least , check for yourselves? Yes a bit longer for delivery which is free ! Like I do I check reviews b4 ordering anything ok see for yourselves!!",5,06/03/2024
This company is awesome and i will order again very soon. The shirts and shoes I m ordered were awesome for the price. The only thing is it takes a little longer for shipping.  Thank you Temu for working with me when I ordered the wrong car charger. I'll be placing another order very soon.,5,06/03/2024
"Parcel was left outside, got stolen and Temu refuse to refund me, FRAUD!!!Your response has just proven my comment. Wow Temu! What a shame of a company. Charge back is going through and I won't be using you again.",1,07/03/2024
Everything I have ordered has been exactly what they said it would be. When they give u a discount of something in your cart they will add it so u just have to delete the full price one. Everyone I know loves it!,5,07/03/2024
"I was initially put off by Temu due to how cheap it was, but after a few family and friends had ordered and raved about it, I decided to try the site out. I ordered a few thing such as a phone case and keycaps, these were significately cheaper than other sites so I kept my expectations low for when they arrived.I was pleasantly surprised by what arrived at my door, the phone cases were good quality and the keycaps were great!I have taken a star off though as I have seen a lot of items using artwork and others intellectual property, I have been recommended enamel pins which I have bought from the original creator myself! I know this isn't a specific Temu complaint as I have also seen products like that on other online marketplaces (AliExpress, Amazon, etc) but it's just something that I have picked up on while browsing.I would recommend Temu if you are looking for a few bits and bobs, but I would shop there with some caution and as the prices are low, keep your expectations low.",4,07/03/2024
I am sad that I paid many orders and now they can't tell me nothing but they're shipped no movement and I did buyvever day. They have lost a customer. They leave you on chat for hr then come back type few words then wait again .poor service after.no more spending with the mall of my orders are not having no tracking.So finally received all or most orders.Happy of that and hope in near future they are shipping with details,1,07/03/2024
"I recently made my first order from Temu. I ordered crafting items zips, templates etc and I also ordered two dresses.Firstly all of the crafting items were great, I am very happy with them.SecondlyThe dresses were awful they were made from the cheapest of the cheap polyester fabric and were not in my opinion wearable items, the fabric was so thin it was see through. Take my advice don?€?t by their clothing.I will continue to buy crafting items because as I said they were as expected.",3,07/03/2024
"I have just received my first parcel from Temu. I was sceptical at first but was pleasantly surprised. I ordered quite a few items (20 in total). Everything was delivered in one piece and items that were breakable like perspex organisational boxes were packaged in cardboard boxes, There are reviews from people that have moaned about the quality but you can't expect to receive lux items at their prices. My purchase only included household bits and pieces so can't comment on other items.",5,07/03/2024

"Poor packaging, cheaply made products. I ordered twice from them and something was broken both times. They did refund without issue. The problem is they only post 4-5 star reviews of the products on their site. I gave honest reviews of all the products. Some I liked and some were terrible. I can say for sure that they do not show my bad reviews. Their shoes are absolute crap! You can find better quality shoes at the dollar store! I did leave great reviews for some of the products, but the ones you see on the site are FAKE.",1,08/03/2024
"The packaging was appalling - lots of plastic held together with loads of sticky tape - took me almost ten minutes to get to the parcel contents, and was not overly impressed by the quality of any of the items I had ordered, In fact one of them, a pack of high speed drills was so rubbish I had to ask for my money back. Fair enough, they provided an immediate refund, but that's not the point - if you cannot rely on the quality then its a waste of time ordering.",1,08/03/2024

But they do deliver and I had a big issue with one item, so decided to return it and got an immediate refund with a ""No need to return this item, you can keep it"" (it will go in the bin but appreciate not having to go through the motions of returning it). General advice, don't buy clothes on Temu!Have bought more and great for cheap stuff (like ebay but better and cheaper), so now a 5 star!",5,08/03/2024
"I was always seeing adverts for this company, prices looked very cheap, so was worried about quality. Decided to give it a try.

It arrived 1 day late, and within 12 hours I had been credited ??5If you're shopping on a budget, then this is for you",5,08/03/2024
A friend told me about Temu 2 months ago. I have become addicted to this site. Maybe that's what they want. But I have to admit I have gotten some excellent clothes and gifts from this site. Some items have been less than desirable and I notified Temu. The company immediately offers you a refund. Either a store credit or credit to your original purchase card. I've used both. They reimbursed my credit card within 24 hours. I purchased a number of small items for favor bags for my daughter's bridal shower. Items exactly the same found on Amazon but cheaper. Many of their items are found on Amazon but cheaper. So when people say they are junk. Think Amazon is the same. Amazon gets a lot of their stuff from China too!!! The one let down is that Temu takes over your phone and their advertisements appear everywhere!Good old Chinese commerce. I hear about the spying controversy. Heck everyone is spying on us!!! I will continue to buy from Temu until something else comes along or I buy them out!.,4,08/03/2024
"I sent back items worth ??33.05, yet only receiving a refund of ??19.94. They have kept ??13.11.  The items were rubbish. The skirt material was good but the hem was ove an inch different all the way round. Parts had a pattern, but the shorter parts didn't.  Whats the point of sending stuff back when you only get half a refund, and they have the goods which they'll sell again.  SCAM!  I got a reply but no mention of the ??13.11 which they kept. They got their goods back yet deduct all that money. WHY?",1,08/03/2024

"The story goes like this.....well I am not a Facebook regular but have had two opposite experiences, one very good and one very bad. Let me clarify Facebook regularly advertise products from companies that get your attention and am highly suspicious of authenticity when thinking of purchasing online. For the bad experience I didn't do my checks, this was on the other company,not Temu, and am still out of pocket of ??60, which I am claiming back via my bank. For Temu I can say the experience was very good. The products are at a competitive price and if you are not bothered by branding then Temu's products are for you. The quality is good and for the price, your expectations will be matched. The returns policy is excellent so you won't get lumbered with extortionate postage costs, that's because its free. I recommend Temu for competitive pricing,quality and great customer service.",5,09/03/2024
"I have received part of my order and the items were of very poor quality. The rest of the order, which was supposed to contain the most expensive item, a drying dish rack, was never received but on the Temu app was flagged as delivered.

I tried to give them a try more than one. Ordered shoes and checked reviews before doing so. First order shoes were too tight. Return shipping is ridiculous so I just ordered again a size bigger.

The collar was very good quality and had her name engraved well on the plaque but it is way too big for her.Update:  I received a refund for the mis-sized collar, without any difficulty at all, so will be able to re-order in a smaller size",5,11/03/2024

Getting back yesterday my neighbour said she didn?€?t receive any package , only for me to check the delivery proof and it was delivered to my doorstep!

"I could break my review up into several categories. Overall, I can say that I've always received what I ordered in a timely manner. Never had to follow up on where my stuff is. Clothing...from what I've ordered, mainly women's blouses, the fabric is ALWAYS a polyester blend, which I dislike. On the other hand, the designs are cute and something I never seen. I always get compliments. Sizing is true to size if you know to order a size up automatically. The thing I don't like about Temu, is that it's gimmicky. Before you know it, you're just confused if you follow any of the promos. Just order what you want, and don't get wrapped up in the gimmicks. The other thing I dislike about them is the forced labor from Chinese citizens. This weighs on me. But I need clothing and don't have a lot of money to spend on it. It's a great website for gift giving too. But...you get what you pay for.",4,11/03/2024
"i came across Temu in an advertisement and i am so glad i did, this shop has changed my whole house there is items i find on amazon for ??30 which i find on Temu for ??3. Organising of kitchen and whole house has changed everything. Thanks Temu",5,11/03/2024
4 orders so far. Very pleased with products and qucikness of deliveries,5,11/03/2024
Not happy at all. I've had to have my bank card stopped as they have twice try to remove money from my account. I will wait to see if I get my order.,1,11/03/2024
"I've ordered loads off this site I've had about 8 packages with 20/30 items, quick delivery really good stuff. I was apprehensive at first but so far so good.",5,11/03/2024
"To my surprise especially in the clothing and shoes were spot on. Fit perfectly and very good quality. I was not surprised on some of the jewelry especially with the chains on some crosses I ordered, we're very flimsy. But the crosses were awesome. Finally some of the coins I ordered and I ordered a lot were mis-leading. Especially with coins I knew ahead of time that they were not coming from repeatable sites. But the uncirculated Morgan's, were sealed and printed 999 pure silver, and they were. So to make a long story short, I love Temu and will continue shopping there.I wish the shipping was faster, still waiting on my last order that was supposed to be here July 15th. It's July 17th.David",4,11/03/2024
Package was delivered stolen off door step Evri agreed and now neither company will refund me and just keep saying speak to the other company disgrace avoid at all costs. As you can see by the reply below very generic copy and paste. The purchase protection is a lie as they still just sending back the parcel was delivered yet courier has agreed it wasn't but they don't want to know still no refund after photo proof was sent 4 times so I stand by this review stating avoid .,1,12/03/2024
Everything has arrived fine and dandy no problem clothes are always a good fit and nice quality,5,12/03/2024
"Shameful malpractice. I was offered a 93% discount for some storage boxes, which would have been a steal. But once in the app, impossible to get we are talking about 3.84$ instead of 55$. So i'm like oh now that seems good. First time buy, don't have alot to lose if it's a scam, you know what I mean.So nope, nothing happening once at check out, zero zip nada. And an article that is ALWAYS at a discount is not at a discount it's not even a promotion at that point.So I open a ticket to talk to a human being, the person behind is kind. Puts me on hold a couple of times and comes back with a 20% discount. Now if you're like me you're like: you're kiding.... right? It's obvious that this is a tactic and false publicity because at the end, even if you get 20% more it's still not 93%. And here, in canada you are obligated BY LAW to honor the price even on promotion. And up till now they refuse to honor it.So yeah bad business fraudulent tactics. STAY AWAY.",1,12/03/2024
"I was very nervous as I ordered a two piece outfit and it's my first time using this company but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived fairly quick and the quality is excellentI was worried, the quality would be rubbish and I'd be waiting week's for it to arrive and I wasn't disappointed, I highly recommend Temu and I have more stuff I'm my cart waiting to be bought ????",5,12/03/2024
"STAY AWAY from this company. They?€?re a fraud. Shorted me items from my order, continuously promised a refund that never came and I had to involve the banks fraud team to claim the money back.I was told they had video evidence of my order being packed and processed but, surprisingly enough they could never prove it, funny that.Somebody called Nancy just sent me the same pre-typed response every-time. Total scam.",1,12/03/2024
Highly recommeneded. Products are top quality and some stuff for as little 58p that actually sell for ??5- ??6 elsewhwere on ebay.

"Edited Original 3 stars * I have ordered 3 times so far and I have received all the orders in about 2 weeks as expected. The price is obviously very affordable. Some items are really worth it (such as kitchen/bathroom/wardrobe accessories etc), some of the clothes poor quality (as expected). My 3 stars review is due to trying to return some items and for some reason (which is not clear or explained as the return is free of charge) only part of the price paid is being refunded. I wish I could upload a screen shot of this. I do not know about the data being used in a malicious way. Added: since my comment Temo team have responded and clarified the issue. Since i have placed 2 more orders, one of which i received today.",4,12/03/2024

"So far so good. I have been very happy with my purchases. The courier let me down with one order but Temu refunded my money immediately. I will be ordering from them regularly.

"Terrible . I don?€?t want to relive details . Many!! Mistakes , responsibility passed to others . Shameful .",1,12/03/2024
"My order never arrived but I had a notification from Evri to say that they had my parcel. Then a notification to say it was delayed so I had an online chat with Temu as you can't speak to them on phone and they said they would give me a refund. I asked several times "" has it been lost"" but all they kept saying is we will give you a refund(waiting for refund now). I then sent email to Evri chasing my order but they say that my Evri tracking number is for a different address so I don't know what happened to my order. I certainly wouldn't order from Temu againEDIT: Have had chat on your website as advised and Thyela suggested that I contact Evri myself, which anyone knows that if your parcel goes missing or late the seller has to contact them NOT the buyer !!!",1,12/03/2024

Good value products.  Great prices. Reasonable quality. Accurate sizing. Delivered on time.  Will use again.,4,13/03/2024
Number one the prices are unbelievable these are the same clothes the big name brand companies use . The only difference is that they put their brand name tag on once they get them. Then sell to us for 6-10 times the price. Don?€?t be fooled about the negative comments about the Temu website.,5,13/03/2024
The dress that I bought doesn?€?t look like the picture they show on their site/app. The quality of fabric and work is poor.,1,13/03/2024
"Shocking poor quality.  Ordered quilting 100% cotton fabric, it was cheap and nasty, badly copied original fabric.  Would never ever buy anything from them again - so cross and disappointed",1,13/03/2024
So far my daughter and other friends have ordered from Temu and I had one issue which really was my fault but they refunded my product which really I wasn?€?t looking for a refund but very nice customer service and products are comparable to other stores not bad great shopping experience for my daughter and I. The car bag for storing could of been a little bigger but not bad .,5,13/03/2024
False advertising. E88 pro drone advertised at ??3.09  - took a screenshot of the ad - when you try to check out the price goes up to ??28. All despite being promised a spin the wheel discount of 95% - conmen16/7/23They've asked for more information... strange they don't want to see the screenshot!20/7/23Update - Temu have applied a ??28 credit to my account which I've used to purchase said drone. We'll see what turns up. Upgraded the review to 2 stars for this.,2,13/03/2024
"I realised prices probably too good to be of decent quality but risked it due to free shipping, this being splashed all over every page.    Not until the buyer has supplied all personal details at check-out does site advise that here is minimum order of ??10.  Why not be upfront about this?  If so, I would have had a good look round to see if anything else appealed.  It annoyed me only to discover this on payment page as I had searched al over to see if this was the case. You now have all my details to do with as you wish. ,  I did not order as it comes over as a bit sneaky, to say the least, and it put my mind in doubt generally about quality and sincerity.Edited On second thoughts I was over-generous with star rating, so now revised.",1,13/03/2024
"I?€?ve been buying from Temu fir a few month now on and off and I must say I am very impressed with their customer service who gets complaints sorted in minutes and their logistics are amazing also get things sorted in a jiffy. No problem with getting your money back if goods don?€?t turn up. If Temu was a shop I would shop for  hours in it, it has so much stuff this is the only place I shop now. Their delivery has  got faster the more I shop. They sell really unusual stuff that I don?€?t see in normal high street shops everyday I see something I want. Beware shoppers this company is very addictive.",5,13/03/2024

A 2m roll really doesn?€?t go far, regardless how big the (clever) sales pic suggest.The socks I bought said US size 6 to 12.  The reality is they just about fit my wife?€?s UK size 6 feet and are made of some very light, poor quality material.  I doubt that anyone would get more than one wear out of them before they fell apart or split.In short, total Tat!",2,13/03/2024
"I left this on the Temu chat today.....I received my parcel today, thank you so much for your speedy delivery turnaround, it took 8 days I was quoted upto 10 days, I needed some items for birthday gifts for tomorrow so I am thrilled that they arrived today!!!!

"I will write Dear Temu because I see that you guys actually respond to these reviews. Which is already a good sign.Dear temu,I like buying things at temu and I was verry happy when I first learned of your app.The clothes are beautiful and you have a bunch of stuff that I would love to have.However and I know the prices are already lower than other companies would charge.It is still a bit disapointing that the quality doesnt always match the image presented. Especially being a woman who has a specific taste in clothes I would love to wear your outfits because they match with my preferences. But if the quality doesnt meet up the image its sad to throw the stuff away. (Because I was a little too late with sending them back)Please keep up the good work you are helping people with low budgets but if there is a possibility that the quality do match the images I think you guys would have A verry good business.",4,13/03/2024
I wasn?€?t sure about this website at first but everything I?€?ve ordered has been perfect can?€?t fault this website I?€?ve spent a lot of money on this website and got everything I asked for. I had one refund due to an item didn?€?t work on me but other than that perfect,5,14/03/2024
"I can honestly say I am impressed by what I have ordered. My first ordered consisted of clothes, bag and bits for the garden. I wasn't expecting much tbh but was pleasantly surprised. Clothes were true to size, bag was great and just like in the photo. Garden items were a little on the small side, but at that price no big deal. I decided to place a second order and again were pleased with what I got. From ordering to delivery it took 6 days, again impressed. I'm about to place my 3rd order so they must be doing something right.",5,14/03/2024
everything i have got has been very good i really like the cloths fast delivery,4,14/03/2024
"Ordered 7 items.  One item was not received in the delivery package.  When notifying Temu, they request photos of packaging and items received.  I don't see how this proves that an item wasn't packed / dispatched at source?  Packaging was in tact and all other items were received.  Very disappointing.   I'll update/send a further review once Temu respond (or, as expected, fail to).",1,14/03/2024
I contacted customer service for a refund. Turned out the chick I spoke to is a prostitue. She openly advertised her after hours services over the phone. We met up on many occasions and hit it off. It is the best experience ever.,5,14/03/2024
"Received my 2nd order from Temu. All the order was complete. Good quality, Dress excellent fit and price.Other items buttons, most unusual designs excellent quality. I recommend Temu. Try it if you haven?€?t yet, I?€?m sure you won?€?t be disappointed. I have just made my 3rd order and know I will not be disappointed and the goods will be delivered on time  Just give Temu a try !!",5,14/03/2024
"There is a fault with the app/website. You can clearly return items for a number of orders together, BUT be warned if you do this you will be charged. There is a fault in the app that allows this, without notifying you. The charges Temu takes off you for your returns that you DID NOT know you were being charged for, as postage stated ??0.00 postage. I returned items from 3 different orders- Temu Sent the wrong sizes. How you can get small mixed up with xI for dog boots is beyond me, apparently this is my fault. was then charged ??2.50 for returning 3 different orders together. You will not be told you are being charged they just take the money from the items u returned. Daylight robbery. Trying to ask customer service for complaints procedure and they say they can?€?t transfer you to another hotline and to speak to them where you go about in circles for days. Shop with caution. Have opened up a customer support case, but all I get after 72 hours is a copy and paste of their returns policy. They didn?€?t even read what I said. Alarm bells are telling me SCAM. Be cautious",1,14/03/2024
What a load of absolute ?€?tat?€?.   What did I expect? Buy cheap buy twice !,1,14/03/2024
"I wish I hadn't ordered from Temu. It never occurred to me that the goods were so cheap there must be something wrong. I haven't yet received my order and if I could stop it I would. I've just discovered that a congressional report says this Chinese-owned e-commerce business has insufficient systems in place to prevent goods made by forced labour being sold on its platform. My cheap clothing that is due to arrive could have been made by some poor slave, who is being forced to work for nothing and who is treated like dirt. I feel guilty as hell for contributing to this disgusting market. I urge anyone who reads this to think again about buying from companies like this. I normally buy clothing from ethical sources and wish I hadn't been tempted. Temu don't care where they get the goods as long as they're cheap.",1,14/03/2024
My order is missing between Temu and Evri.  I contacted them using chat on their website.  Full credit of my order within 3 minutes. Excellent customer service.  I?€?ve had five orders without issues and have only sent one item back out of 25.  I cannot fault them,5,14/03/2024
I was abit doubtful with looking at the comments but my first order arrived today and not a problem with anything The old saying you get what you pay for was what I was expecting but even though they are not top quality they are better than expected will shop again ????,5,14/03/2024
"One has to bear in mind that if you're gonna pay peanuts.... So, bearing that in mind I was not really expecting much from my 1st order. I thought, even if it is 'tat' I only have myself to blame. Well, how lovely to receive all my items in the parcel within the delivery time given. What cost me ??25 ish would have been triple that anywhere else. With that in mind I ordered again, this time some clothes. I'm tall, and Asians are pretty much short so no surprise that the trousers didn't reach my ankles. But mid-calf is good enough, for the price, and it's summer, so... Not sure I'd buy winter trousers. All the items I bought were present and correct and early.I do not indulge nor do I persue the 'flash ads', pop-ups and so-called 'you have won'. It is a way for Temu to make you spend more, which is just marketing and understandable. Having said that, I have ordered bits n bobs I don't really need but spoiling myself a little, for a change, without going into debt was very nice. My 3rd parcel which is due soon, contains a beauty product. Not something I usually buy online so I am really curious how it will work out. I will not be miffed if it is s@#t as so far, it has been 5 star. To bear in mind: I have not had any issues so no need to contact Temu thus far.It makes me laugh that some people pay, for example, a tenth of the price for something and then complain. Pay ten times the price, then complain. However, I do feel for the ones that have had incomplete or non-deliveries. That has happened to me thrice over the last two years with Amazon. Is it worse because it's cheap? In my book, it is the same. The Temu logistics manager must be a whizz. I don't envy him/her.Final note: I expect Temu sources from companies that uses cheap labour. As does Primark, H&M, Monsoon and many other brands. Their profit margin is most likely bigger too. Cheap labour: are you willing to pay ??10/h for all the clothes you buy? Most of us don't. If you object (I know I do) you cannot shop anywhere. Also, though it is cheap labour, it provides a measly income to thousands upon thousands of people. Where else would they earn a pittance? Most likely nowhere. If everything became 'fair' overnight the planet would be overstretched. Not nice but that's the way it is, sadly. One is stuck between a rock and a hard place. I cannot change the world, neither can most of us. That's up to 'leaders' and the ones in power.In summary, some of you have had bad luck to be expected considering the size of the company, and others, like me, are chuffed to bits.",5,14/03/2024
I placed 2 orders and received 2nd one first and 1st one second so delivery was good. 2 out of 4 items of 2nd order were OK and only placed that order cuz i would get hand sewing machine for ??2 not used yet but seems okay if it works. Ordered bag and looked big on pic but stupid me didn't look at measurements well it very small and the shoulder strap small but looked really nice so if it was bigger it would have been fine. Clothing one item 2 small and others bit to big but quality OK Nothing great. But the toiletry bags not bad so will use them. The clothes and bag i was going to return but i probably won't get a refund reading reviews and I don't have a printer so can't print labels they should at least put labels in bag but who does that anymore. But have to put it down to not listen to hype as most reviews i have watched raves about it but most of stuff u can get in cheap shops in town. So no i wouldn't recommend this company I'm afraid,3,14/03/2024

Temu is super cheap. The items I've bought and it's lots have been excellent quality. Although I've only bought kitchen and storage products. The shipping is free and super super fast. Leaves eBay's shipping from China dead. eBay is often 3 or more months and Temu gets the delivery in under a week. Fantastic.One item arrived damaged and Temu sent me the refund within 2 minutes of my making a claim. It was back in my account the next day. No arguments about the fault like you get on eBay with endless problems with faults and refunds.Can't fault Temu it's amazing and fabulous.,5,15/03/2024
"Well I have to hold my hands up. When I first saw Temu on Facebook I thought it was a scam website. After due diligence I decided to try a test order, a few cheap items.

Well this wasn?€?t an option so I told the advisor I would never use this company again.

What I can?€?t understand is that the website redirected to download the app, how can they NOT see that? Told them time etc but it never occurred to me to take a screenshot. Very unhelpful and disappointing customer service. Never shopping again. She said she will cancel order still not received any update about that.",1,16/03/2024
Wow order was shipped really fast. Was sceptical about the quality because of the price. But was quite impressed. Very pretty items. One needed to be returned but money was refunded straight away.

All was great apart from a 'mango flan' candle that was a little squashed.  But I was able to get a full refund and keep the item.

"I always received orders from TEMU ahead of schedule or right on time since last year, All orders have been as they seemed on the website good material for the price.The last three orders have been lost in shipment, late and a refund has been extended. Yesterday, I received notice my order arrived in the city and was on the way, I tracked it on DHL only to be told the merchandise could not be delivered. I rescheduled the delivery for the next day and did not receive it. Spoke with Customer service who explained the merchandise is being held up by clearance inspection for the third time. I'm so disappointed.",4,16/03/2024

Since then I have placed a bigger order and once again everything has arrived as described and undamaged!

"The Temu app is nothing but a deceitful and corrupted company that should be reported to the trading standards. Their false marketing strategies and the spread of fake free gifts and giveaways to entice users is downright despicable. This app promotes cheap products and prices, luring unsuspecting users into their trap.Firstly, their product range is nothing short of a joke. The cheap quality items they offer are far from what they advertise. Trying to pass off knock-off products as premium goods is both fraudulent and unethical. From the flimsy electronics to the disappointing clothing, everything screams ""low quality"" and ""complete waste of money.""When it comes to prices, Temu takes the cake for false advertising. The initial prices they display are ridiculously marked up to make it appear as though you're getting a huge discount. However, upon closer inspection, you'll notice that even the discounted prices are still outrageously high for the subpar quality you receive.Rather than building a reputable brand, Temu seems more interested in exploiting unsuspecting users through false advertising and cheap, inferior products. It's clear that their main goal is to make a quick buck by tricking customers into purchasing rubbish items at exorbitant prices.Let's not forget the app's shady tactic of attempting to spread its reach through fake free gifts and giveaways. Promising users the chance to win high-value items for free is just a ploy to gather personal information and cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Temu's deceitful practices reflect a complete lack of integrity and disregard for the law.It's time for users to unite and report this fraudulent company to the trading standards. Temu should be held accountable for its deceptive practices and for breaking UK law. It's unacceptable to see a company like this fooling innocent customers and tarnishing the online marketplace.In conclusion, I strongly advise staying away from the Temu app and urging others to do the same. Their fake products, false advertising, and attempts at spreading through deceitful tactics cannot be tolerated. Let's put an end to Temu's shady business practices and protect consumers from being fooled by their deceptive marketing strategies.Just stick with Amazon.  That way it's just genuine.Edit: on 13/07/2023 03:42 Temu requested further details in an attempt to take down review.",1,17/03/2024

My order was shipped with lasership and STILL hasn't made it. Temu refunded me and gave me a $5 credit and still say my items will be delivered. That is not why I gave them 5 stars.... There was a girl named Jessica on the ?online? Customer service SHE gets the five stars. Because of her I will continue to be a temu customer,5,17/03/2024
I have recently bought from Temu. I have ordered 5 orders and been pleased with everything I have bought.The clothes are beautifully made and the prices are amazing.I will continue to buy from Temu as I love the variety that you sell in many different things from clothes to household things. Thankyou so much regards Dorothy Gillies,5,17/03/2024

Temu is absolutely a horrible company. Shipping takes a long time. The returns take a long time too. Refunds take forever. It's just not a good idea to order from this company.  As soon as I get my refund I will not be shopping with Temu anymore. You get what you pay for in this life. The products are okay. Nothing spectacular. I don't recommend Temu.,2,17/03/2024

The customer photos on item reviews are (as far as I'm concerned) 100% genuine, ([read this sentence with a smirk ????] some of the photos & videos can't have been faked ????????).

"I have ordered half dozen times. I received all the items that I ordered.  One shipment was not delivered on schedule. Temu offered $5 coupon automatically (no request necessary).  Most items work well. A few didn't perform as well as expected but the overall prices are so cheap, I just wrote them off. Not worth the time to negotiate a return.  Most of them are cheaper than Amazon, particularly small kitchen gadgets.  But Amazon offers a service that is unparallel (and you pay for it too).",5,19/03/2024
I never got to try my order as unfortunately the TEMU use Evri for delivery.... otherwise known as the world's worst delivery service.

"DO NOT USE!!! Packages lost, items missing, items returned but they say they never received!!?€? Will not issue refund!!! They send junk!!!They send items via ONTRACK which does not deliver items to correct address. The driver takes a picture of package that could be anywhere and says it?€?s delivered to the correct address. In my case, they left the package OUTSIDE my apartment building which is in downtown Portland. I chatted with Temu customer service and provided photo where driver left package and Temu said there was nothing they can do as ONTRACK said the package was delivered to the correct address. (And it wasn?€?t! It was NOT delivered to my door; and therefore it wasn?€?t the correct address.) the package was stolen of course! I spent an hour on the phone with Temu. The customer service agent said the get calls all the time that OnTrack delivered to the wrong address but there is nothing Temu can do because OnTrack received the package and then it is OnTracks problem not theirs!!?€? So no refund or replacement!!! OnTrack customer service says to contact the seller!  WHISH gets a bad rep these days, but I have NEVER had an issue with WISH!

I have ordered many items off the site Temu.  All items received have been consistent with what I ordered.  You have to review sizing charts and read other customer reviews.

"The contents of my order were damaged by the paint that I ordered not being packaged securely and leaking throughout the package. The tubes that the paint were in were flimsy and should have been packed in a box to prevent spilling into other plastic containers with holes and openings. The other items had been damaged in other ways too. It was as something heavy was sat on my package and smashed the other containers. I called Temu the same day that this mess was delivered and spoke with customer service. I informed the rep that I wanted the items replaced and she saw the pictures that I had uploaded of the damages. The CSR said there was no need to return the damaged items as she could see the damage was extensive. My clothes that I was wearing when I opened the package were also damaged by the leaking paint. I told her thanks because I didn't want to cut my hand on the smashed plastic pieces, get paint damage in my car or mess up my clothes further. I was told that the escalation team would contact me within 24 hours. I called back Friday evening when I hadn't heard anything, and the latest CSR acted as if there weren't any notes/photos and asked me if I had the messy, damaged items to return. I explained what the other CSR said and that I have placed over 50 orders before without any requests for replacement due to Temu's negligent packaging. The fact that most of my orders were well over $100+ dollars into the $400.00 range should be ample proof of my distress about this damaged order. The new CSR said that he would refer this issue up to the escalation team again and I should expect to have someone reach out to me within 24 hours. I have heard from no one at Temu concerning this matter as of today. It's bad enough that most of my orders don't include the option to request the price adjustments that Temu so proudly claims that you can do up to 30 days after paying for your order. The option should be in EVERY order but it isn't so the 30 days runs out and customer service still no solution about why that price adjustment option still isn't in all of my orders. I can't recommend this company to anyone at this point.Update: Temu's response lets me know that it's customer service representatives don't listen or read very well. Temu's own CSR told me on 07/05/2023 to cancel the return that I initiated to return the damaged, broken, wet and leaking items caused by Temu's insufficient packaging of containers of acrylic paint. I sent Temu more than enough pictures of the damaged package and the items. I didn't ask for a refund just that the items be replaced. I have called twice since this incident and no one from Temu's ""escalation team has called or emailed me as of today. Temu's response is a generic one that implies help and action when customer's bring up issues but they don't actually do anything but repeat inane policies and use excuses. I provided Temu with the reference number that I was given. It has had ample time to pull the call records since the representatives said that the calls were being recorded. What's Temu's excuse now?",1,20/03/2024

At first I am little nervous about it is a scam but temu is reliable. They provide tracking number and compensate $5 when the order arrive late. The items are good for its price and many items are cute and useful. It is hard when buying clothes and shoes because the sizes sometimes are quite off. I love the shoes I bought from temu because they are fashionable and comfortable. Give it the try because I think it is good!,5,21/03/2024

I asked  to review the situation because is not my fault that the parcels are missing but seems that nobody can understand the situation . Also they have on their website on q&a the same thing that they will refund the buyer if the parcel is lost Z",1,21/03/2024
Temu very obstructive in dealing with customer service problems AVOID them,1,22/03/2024
"I've bought quite a number of good products from Temu.  Good delivery times.  Great prices.  Some items aren't so good but that's only been things that are supposed to help straighten wonky toes - I don't really think anything would work but I keep trying.  The clip on phone holder was no good, only because it didn't fit on my rearview mirror but would have been better than phone holders with suction pad that always fall off the windscreen!  I've bought and been pleased with; sewing thread, magnetic device to hold phone in car, inky thing to obliterate personal details on documents, a summer dress, fabric, gardening gloves; amongst other things.",4,22/03/2024
Very pleasantly surprised at just how good this is. I have bought a lot and it's all been very good value.,5,22/03/2024
"Very pleasantly surprised! I read the wildly varying reviews and ordered around ??40 of goods. I didn?€?t expect much; anticipated a long delay in receipt, shoddy or missing goods. My order arrived a day early. It was a very small parcel so I thought many items would be missing. Not so! They were vacuum packed (very creased) but otherwise every item was there. OK so a couple of the tops were not the finest quality fabric but they were certainly worth what I paid for them. Impressed and will order again.",4,22/03/2024
"Love Temu.Ordering adult clothing  kids clothing  household items  delivery about 2 weeks both times.Fave items thus far are my magnetic curtain tie backs ??1.45 a pair!!! Memory foam double sized bath mat......sink in,very comfy. Great packaging, great communication x",5,22/03/2024
Honestly thought my stuff might never arrive but it did and I am pleasantly surprised with the quality given how cheap it was.,5,22/03/2024
"Ive had 3 orders from Temu so far and all are amazing! Amazing quality and value, love it!!",5,22/03/2024
"Our first order was for 2 pairs of harem pants. One pair are fine. The 2nd are enormous, could get both my legs in one leg!Tried to return them, had a problem with their returns site,pressed cancel by mistake. Was then told now we cannot return the item, as we cancelled!   A pity as I would have used Tenu again.",1,22/03/2024
Was reluctant at first - place a small a order around ??4 came very quickly and tracking was provided - have placed many orders including clothing and all has been as expected good quality for small price,5,22/03/2024
"This company is scamming its users and has a ?€?Cash reward?€? on their app which gives you no ?€?Cash reward?€? and all it is, is a gimmick to get you to invite new users too the app while you get nothing and no ?€?Reward?€? it gets purposely harder to actually gain any tokens to receive such ?€?Cash Reward?€? and it?€?s a complete scam and waste of time if you can you should DELETE and REMOVE Temu. I also have a ticket open with their support to hopefully receive some of the funds I should I won with their ?€?Cash reward?€? and I?€?ll update this review if they actually do fund me properly which ( I know they won?€?t because it?€?s a shady company built of child labor and scams) but anyways I would avoid this app at all cost! /EDIT UPDATE 07/10/23 I was given $25 dollars in Temu credit and a %20 percent off coupon for the issue which is nice but I still think there is some work to do to improve Temu. updating to 2 stars.",1,22/03/2024
"Worst customer service ever. They harass you for hours acting like they will help. Then they rudely hang up chat out of nowhere. They refused to give me $.08 that gift box game told me I won, but it never showed up on my account. I even had screenshot proving the prize, but they said that meant nothing. That is fraud. And Temu is pathetic if their customers aren?€?t worth giving them the $.08 they won. I am never shopping here again.",1,22/03/2024
"I bought hundreds of items from Temu, including bracelets, keyrings, charms, hats, t-shirts, and so on. I can say that only 2 items were actually worth the effort and as advertised. Everything else is plastic, fragile and very very poor quality. I'm giving a 2 and not a 1 because they ship very fast and their customer service is quick to reply but I won't buy from Temu again.",2,22/03/2024

Suitcases are jam packed with everything from underwear and socks, to swimwear and 2 complete outfits per day including several pairs of shoes/sandals/trainers each. All came when it said it would aside from one parcel which was a day late but I received a ??5 credit to my account for this. All in all, my experience has been good and I?€?d definitely order again, the prices are unreal!",5,22/03/2024
"Asked some questions with one of the customer service providers, (C), and was met with great help regarding questions involving shipping. Aside from that all orders have come within or before the shipping time period which is brilliant!",5,22/03/2024
I received my items very quickly 4 days love everything I got will be shopping again 100% kept me up to date with my delevery love temu,5,22/03/2024
"Dear Temu - Please stop asking Trustpilot to remove my reviews of you. Theyve reinstated the last one you asked them to remove after I provided proof of purchase.I told you I would 1 star you every single time your chosen couriers Evri fail to deliver, and guess what? Correct. They've failed to deliver, so hears your one star. The parcel has gone missing, the tracking frozen for days on end with no contact from Evri, nothing, not a sausage, and besides, the bot you can only get to talk to is well, useless. You will continue to lose customers. I like some of the items you sell, if one is savvy enough and experienced enough, one can pick out the good from the bad. So heres your latest 1 star.  You need to start listening to your customers, or they will go elsewhere. The laughable thing about this latest failed deliver is its a replacement of the last failed delivery! The Evri warehouse dont have the parcel, I drove down there and just walked in the compound and spoke a lad who told me the courier has it, and I recorded the conversation on bodycam. So its been reported as stolen to the police I have a crime ref number too and evri and your courier will be getting a visit soon. Its no good just refunding every time, dont you care that your courier is stealing/losing/damaging/ parcels? Evri need holding to account. Do you think it might be possible to not give me a copy/paste response? Do you care?*11 07 23 - And there's your copy/paste response. You obv dont care that much about the issue, built into the business model I suspect.",1,22/03/2024
I've overall had a good experience.Ive been using temu for a long time now and always get my products within two weeks and there was a issue they've always refunded my money.,5,22/03/2024
I love the products from this website. Prices are good especially for crafting. Just wish the shipping was faster.,4,22/03/2024
I have made many orders through temu is just 2 short weeks. I won $100 in credit and everything has already arrived I am so pleased with what I have gotten so far and can not wait to get more items!!!,5,22/03/2024
The items arrived and out of 13 items 10 were returned - the quality was terrible.I returned the items only to be refunded 8 items as allegedly only 8 were received. I will never use this company again -  you get what you pay for plus pay for what you return.DO NOT USE,1,22/03/2024
"Fantastic, very happy indeed with my first order. Great value for everything, super fast delivery with regular updates on shipping status. Not sure you could ask for more!",5,23/03/2024
I tried to return part of my orderAfter two weeks I received a message from Temu which tell me that they can?€?t refund any money because they CHECK the parcel but the items wasn?€?t inside?€?????????????Basically I send back a ?€?empty?€? bagI contact them and they told me someone will investigate the caseAfter few days I received another message?€?this time they told me that they can?€?t refund the money because the items didn?€?t pass the warehouse checkI didn?€?t even tried?€?just checked the material which looked like a Asda plastic bag and send it backNever again,1,23/03/2024
"I've been using Temu for a while now with very few issues. The products sold on Temu are the same ones sold on Amazon just cheaper. The reason it's cheaper for most things (but not all) is because the sellers are not paying the high fees Amazon charges. Some items low prices are only for a limited time so you may see increases at a later time.I've gotten all my items in the timeframe they tell you. The few issues I had they immediately refunded me without the headaches other places create for you.If security is an issue for you, don't use the app, buy online and use a pre paid card or PayPal.Those worried they are being spied on are not even considering every app, every site, your phone, your TV, etc all track you. Statements like ""their government is spying on me"" is ridiculous and would probably be better served by not being online or owning a smart phone.",5,23/03/2024
"I have had a couple of items from Temu via a friend. I was pleased they were basic. I wanted some shelf lining paper which is very difficult to get the one I want in the UK. I?€?ve had it from other countries before and it does last. I found some reasonably priced on Timo and it arrived exactly what I wanted, except a packet in a sack. They had dropped it into so instead of been a certain with it was half with what I?€?ve been folded in half. The flask held 25% less than it should?€?ve done. It stated it was 500 mils and even if I didn?€?t put a cap on it I could barely get 400 mils in. Flask is actually for a gift and I ordered in a gift box which was so battered ?€? it isn?€?t the items I?€?m really complaining about is the way they were treated by whoever packed them. Just been squashed into a bag and damaged my being squashed Delivered on time, and they are on the whole as described, but not looked after by staff.EDITEDHalf to say, although I got no response on the day of the delivery, I had a response in the middle of the night!After ?€?chatting?€? to a customer service agent, I?€?ve had replacement and refund. That is very fair and I can ask for no more. I also had an apology.",4,23/03/2024
"It has the very cheapest items that are the very lowest quality. You will not get your orders in less than 10 days, and orders will more often than not, get lost. You will get no help at all from customer service. I have gotten many items that broke immediately or arrived damaged because they do not use boxes or any kind of wrapping to protect items. It is packaged in a thin plastic bag and tape. Nothing else. The quality of clothing is horrendous. These are things made in China with no quality control, made of lead, food containers not safe to put food in, and sold cheap...just to sell things. Stay stay stay away from Temu.",1,23/03/2024
1st time I've ever used their website and have zero complaints. Ordered 4 items that all came together and were exactly the same as stated. The delivery date was spot on and the price of the items are the cheapest by far on the whole of the internet you won't find them cheaper anywhere else. I will 100% be using this site again and from my own experience can't fault it.,5,23/03/2024

"I love their products. Side note, buy for cheap prices and you'll get cheap quality. Play their games but a waste of time. You hit big until you're about to win and boom invite people to win.

What can I say? Temu is a great company to buy top quality items on the cheap. Quick delivery and all well packaged. We will definitely be buying things from these guys in future. Top notch keep up the good work.,5,24/03/2024
"Really user friendly site/app. Pleased with purchases so far; summer cotton pants, tankini and bathroom bits. ??5 credit for a day's late delivery is impressive customer service. Manage push preferences to keep temptations at bay & your spend within your purse!  For affordable stuff that you need it's definitely worth a try just watch getting sucked into overspending.",4,24/03/2024
"Great products, quick delivery, very impressed with all my orders",5,24/03/2024
I like Temu for the cheap crafting stuff. I don't like the fact they've obviously sold my email address. A brand new email address that never received junk until my first Temu order. Now I get a dozen a day.,3,24/03/2024
"Really pleased with quality, price and delivery, amazing, the only problem with us is that you have to take returns to Yodel, we live miles from any depot, it would be great if we could return items by Royal Mail",5,24/03/2024

Usually really good having placedOver 8-9 ordersOn this occasion 1 of the shipments was left outside my doorstep from Royal Mail of which I left no request for thisI returned home and the parcel wasn?€?t there and Temu are refusing to help as they claim they are not responsible. Because the parcel was sent from overseas and I am the buyer not the seller I cannot place a claim despite being advised to speak to Royal MailTemu customer service are shocking and re-send the same email over and over,1,25/03/2024
Their delivery service is not professional and no one at Temu is getting back to me.  It's been 2 days.,1,25/03/2024
My order said 2 weeks but it came within 6 days. Pleasantly surprised at the quality of items. Obviously not the best but you get what you pay for.,5,25/03/2024

"Smooth process, thought there would be a delay. The pieces have been shipped on time, very easy to use",5,25/03/2024
I have received two orders now and the service could not be better. Plenty of emails so I could track my order and it was delivered on time. Everything I ordered has been excellent for the price.

"I have ordered clothing, shoes, jewelry and health products.  I have return a dress, and jewelry and it was free return, instead of returning to my account I ask for a credit. The 2nd dress that that I was going to return, I did not have to return and credited my account. When I made another purchase, the credit that had put on my order.  The delivery date they give is usually on or between those dates.",5,25/03/2024
I live in a residential with less than 40 homes. There is no gate and no security guard. Any delivery driver can enter the residential community without requiring an access code. The delivery company asked for an access code or instructions to complete the delivery. Emphasis. A delivery code is not needed to delivery to my home. The tracking says the package was delivered at the front door. The delivery failed to upload a photo showing proof of delivery. The package was not delivered to my home. I notified Temu the same day and they instantly told me that they can?€?t assist because the address on the order is correct. Just because the address on the address is correct doesn?€?t mean the delivery company went to the correct address. Temu refused to issue a reshipment nor a refund. Temu?€?s purchase protection program is a joke ****** Temu users underhanded tactics to get over on customers.Update: Temu response doesn?€?t resolve the issue. I have applied for a refund and was denied more than once. It doesn?€?t seem like Temu read my review. I submitted a review because TEMU.COM and TEMU LIVE CHAT refused to issue an refund. Temu response is not satisfactory!!!,1,25/03/2024
Unfortunately not as good as Shein. Ive ordered off Temu now 3 times and ive had issues with at least 1 product in each delivery Ive had. They just arent the same quality. The product doesnt always do what they should. The clothes say a size M but it would only fit a size 6. It was tiny. Ive never had these issues with Shein.,2,25/03/2024
"Very impressed with the level of communication from Temu. Right from the start I was dealing with a customer focused company. That may sound an exaggeration but true. Also, the product was very competitively priced, arrived on time, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was exactly as advertised!",5,25/03/2024
Items were never received and Temu refused to issue a refund items were marked as delivered but never received  they didn even offer store credit,1,25/03/2024
Actually decent delivered fast quality of items is better than I expected made ??40 from it plus gifts The game is good if you put afq81307 in the search bar you can make money too! So easy,5,25/03/2024
I?€?ve been nothing but happy. Returns goes smoothly. If something doesn?€?t work for me. Even a couple times they told me to keep the item and refunded me. But most of the time it?€?s the same stuff that?€?s on Amazon for less than half the price.,5,25/03/2024
"I have 3,parcels that haven't arrived, I have them delivered to a Tesco collection store so it's not possible that delivery couldn't be made or that it's been incorrectly delivered. After contacting Evri the parcel courier & getting no answer I reached out to Temu, they added ??10 to my credit account for the 3 missing parcels, as delivery was free & the contents of each cost more than ??10 this makes no sense.All I want is for someone to find out in real time what is going on, am I to receive my parcels or not? I'm not after a refund & I can't afford Temus ""helpful advice"" to re order the items then ask for a refund.... According to Georgio who was the agent I dealt with earlier today ( I can't remember the names of those I spoke with when I first reported the problem 3 days ago & got no help) the main problem both for Temu & Evri is ""In the UK there are too many customers""!!In the beginning Temu offer amazing deals & special offers to customers hoping no doubt to encourage a higher spend, that's the business & I've no problems with that, however once they have your money, they obviously couldn't care less about any concerns or complaints you have, they are after all using the cheapest & least trustworthy courier company in the UK.Please don't be tempted by the constant barrage & endless social media advertising , Temu already consider UK customers as ""too many"", any new business will only annoy them even more... Use Shein instead, at least they follow delivery from leaving them to the CUSTOMER actually receiving their orders & that's definitely worth paying a bit extra forUpdate...07/07/23Below is the ""msg"" I received from Temu in response to my reviewThey can't even be bothered to read the complaintsAvoid this company",1,25/03/2024

I can only speak for myself.  But I have today reserved my 2ed delivery from TEMU. And I am extremely satisfied with not only the product but the delivery time also. I have now just put my 3ed order in. I must say I have not ordered any clothing or shoes . But thank you for upholding your promise so far I'm a very happy customer.,5,26/03/2024
"This is my second review?€?..I wanted to see if my second experience was as good as my first. And it wasn?€?t. It was better!! Temu, you have got a huge fan here?€?I have loved everything I have had, so far, and will continue to do so! Incase anyone is thinking I am being paid to give such a good review, be assured I am not. I believe in giving credit when due!Thanks.",5,26/03/2024
"Temu is unscrupulous. Customers are only aware there is a minimum spend at the end of the ordering process, the amount of which seems to vary from day to day. Yesterday, the minimum spend is GBP10, and today, it is increased to GBP15. As such, customers are left in the dark. Indeed, this Chinese shopping site is a disservice to China. What a shame.",1,26/03/2024

I have ordered several times.  Delivery times were as promised if not sooner.  I threw away a pair of earring because they weren?€?t right?€? but I paid .79 for them.  I ordered a smart watch that wouldn?€?t charge or work correctly.  I tried to return it and was told to keep it and my money was refunded.  For clothing you do need to be away of sizes.  Also be sure to check measurements on things.  Many great deals.,5,27/03/2024
"I used it on off by mistake of my self petty needs in addiction to buy things to please and make happiness that?€?s never satisfying. Here was horrible too cause all too small then I was to believe as well everything advertised wrong showing more functionality in products that didn?€?t come in with em . For instance portable hand held air pumps showed cordless with 7.4 volt batteries and was on sale we got corded ones yuck ????- thens if we send a bad unwanted item we didn?€?t know was coming wrong we lose 1st - return free shipping and have to pay to return this bad items . The shirts I ordered were multiple stripes as cotton cloths smelled horrible like chemicals and not as advertised some say all cotton then come in with tags saying recycled materials heck no never never ?????€? over all this stuff is all low quality and you can do better on Walmart or something like that to do with out is best for the future cause this co makes more stuff that doesn?€?t work out.  I ordered a car jump starter from Temu and it was advertised as high price discounts and has all protection modes for safety-, well we jumped my Nissan v6 and it exploded they wouldn?€?t answer in chat till I kept saying this is unreturned able cause of lithium batteries on plane ?????? or post office could set on fire ????  with the unit blow up went crazy had pictures they offered me 8.00 I complained and finally they made me send it to get 26.69 back I used a post office worker who tagged it a did me favor no one else would take it they are rude crazy . I did get the credit at risk to others .   From this experience they don?€?t have deals economically on these use tack light brands only ! Bad service never ever get the real quick person cycled cycle through like eBay junky system too horrible horrible service horrible customer delivery takes for ever not knowing when to be around to keep  it from getting stolen from neighbors who tell other people that we just got items they team up to get us . Do you want to be torture this is the place .   Avoid spinning the stupid wheel ???? it will pull ya in for games at your expense. ????????????????",1,27/03/2024

"everything about temu is great! NO BALONEY!  people that dont buy from temu ,they are dumb! I LOVE TEMU!!!",5,28/03/2024
I have been using temu for a while nowA lot of people think it is a scam but it isn't I have bought from this site and yes it takes about a week to receive your goods I've had no problems with this site so farYou can even play games on the site to get free items it does take ages to feed fish or to get your crops but it's worth itYou don't need to put credit card details in,5,28/03/2024
"Ordered from TEMU for the first time and must admit I put a review up saying how worried I was due to the vouchers not working which they failed to give me but took myPayment, other than this I liked the products I paid for they are nice quality too.I would tell you you do not get free items no such thing ! I will now be ordering more now I know the quality of current products were good. I hope future purchases are the same.",4,28/03/2024
"Just received by parcel from Temu and surprisingly pleased at the quality of the items. Rucksack has loads of room and is good quality, wash bag has lots of room and can be hung up and the coat hanger extenders have given me loads more room. Don?€?t know how Temu do it. And Evri delivered before it was due",5,28/03/2024
"Update on 18th/08/2023:I didn?€?t find it worthy. I decided to delete my Temu account, after all. I definitely prefer quality to quantity. Let?€?s face it, there is a reason why Temu is so cheap and it is because  you compromise on quality.  Don?€?t confuse between budget items and cheap items, like I did. Temu is cheap with sub-quality items and seem photoshop to look good.  You may think you find good buys, write a fair review, until you realise they break a few weeks later. I tried it for the hype but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and ethically, I can?€?t recommend it.I will leave my original review below but I am taking one star off and people can make an informed choice. Original review:Nothing wrong with the concept and the execution/running of Temu.  It is like taking a stroll to the Pound shop except you don?€?t need to go out, though there are things to consider and I am  listing them below:The Pros: So, if you are on a budget, Temu can be great. For example, if your kids are going away to Uni, you can  furnish/accessorise their room for very little. Considering Temu is in China, the delivery is quite fast. About a week to ten days max. You cut the middle person meaning that most of your purchases are cost price/factories?€? prices. If you are not satisfied, you can return the stuff. I have not use this facility yet , so I cannot comment on the return process and/or customer service. You will be able to find good buys that would cost you triple on other well known shopping platforms. Yes, people do buy on Temu to re-sell on Etsy, Amazon, eBay etc?€? with a hefty profit margin. The cons:Be aware there are plenty of useless articles that look attractive because they are so cheap. Better to ignore those.  Don?€?t rely solely on images. You need to read reviews, especially those with videos as they can give you a good indication on how the product actually looks. Also, read the reviews on other platforms. Images are deceptive. Get your tape measure and check the measurements for yourself. Buy only what you needed to buy in the first place and give yourself a budget otherwise, you?€?ll end up with a lot of  things that you wouldn?€?t have bought had you gone to the shops. Read descriptions carefully. Stock pictures can show you sets of something and if you are not careful, you won?€?t realise that you buy only 1 piece of said set. Sizing for clothes can be on the small side so order a size above and bear in mind clothing is most of the time polyester. So, in a nutshell, you need to plan your ?€?shopping trip?€? and allow enough time because you need to shop smart. To finish, why only a 3 stars review? Because, in my opinion, Temu is a potential hazard for hoarders and compulsive shoppers.  Temu should come with a warning sign that it can be addictive. If you have a family member, a friend or colleague you know to be a hoarder, compulsive shopper or depressed, please do not introduce them to Temu. It will have devastating consequences for them due to the ease of shopping, the attractiveness of the website and the prices.  Before you know it,  their house will be full of junk and their bank balance in the red. I have seen it happen.",2,28/03/2024
"My parcel has been stolen by the delivery man, I requested a reshipment and the sender hasn't sent my order for 5 days. (Its been at the airport for that long) and I am still waiting.  I want my money back:(",1,28/03/2024
"Temu advertises ""free returns"" what they don't tell you is that the free return is only for one item out of the order.  To return a second or more item(s) it will cost you $7.99 for each additional item.  They also will combine purchases made at different times into one order.  Order1 item and a couple of days later order another and they will combine it into one order but you can only return 1 item free.  Very misleading ad.  Will say delivery time was good.",2,28/03/2024
"The experience of so much selection in so many categories is a treat and fun. A lot of the items you may find in a dollar store, but there are unique items you have only seen in Asian places online. Price is great, delivery is excellent and deals are worth it. Have never had a problem with purchasing. Some items you have to read carefully for size, material etc... but once in the swing of it, it's pretty easy. Recommended !!",5,28/03/2024
"First off, I'm suprised with the bad reviews on this site. What you must know, all of the items that are available on Temu are also available on the big A site. The only difference is the price! Temu is a fraction of the price of what you'd pay for the exact same item there (as we all know, most of the stuff on A**zon is from China). I've had nothing but a great experience with Temu. Order arrives in about a week and my bank account is happy. If I would have bought the items on A, I would've paid over double.",5,28/03/2024
"Overall good experience, I?€?ve received credit in My account due to late arrivals in the past but items have arrived shortly after. Returns are easy enough but you do have to wait quite a while to actually get your money back.",4,29/03/2024
"Cheap items and fast delivery considering the distance. First order the delivery driver left it at the entrance of a communal flats and it got stolen. Another packed was reshipped. This is down to the delivery driver, not temu. However temu still offered reshipment. Goods recieved were decent quality, will use again for further things ????",5,29/03/2024
"Awful company awful customer service, they cheat on games and the items are useless and poor quality.",1,29/03/2024
"I have a 95% satisfaction experience with Temu.  Rarely a disappointment.  Have bought women?€?s clothes, pants, tops, dresses, sweaters, bras, underwear, rings, earrings, shoes and even more clothes for my two teenage grandsons.  Prices can?€?t be beat, quality has not been an issue.  Fake plants look real, great sunglasses, makeup, detox patches, kitchen items.  Great coats, hats, gloves.  Keep seeing people selling Temu products for three and four times the price.  Must be trying to make a profit off them.  Foot patches help me immensely with my twitchy feet at night.  I love Temu.  Met a lady wearing a white daisy ball cap she paid 30 bucks for showed her the exact same hat on Temu for less than 4 bucks.  Perhaps if this administration hadn?€?t ruined our economy Temu would not be so successful.  By the way my son bought me some beautiful light blue glass tea cups with butterflies for Mothers Day none were broken.",5,29/03/2024

"I give one star because you used the worst delivery company in the world  EVRi. Every time I get a delivery from these awful people, they mess up badly. I will stop shopping with you because of your choice of couriers! Shame because I like the cat food bowls. For your information, Temu, the delivery driver did not ring the doorbell, or knock on the door. Instead, they opened the door and threw the parcel on the floor. Awful, awful company.Update: 05/07/2023.Thank you for your reply. Thankfully, the parcel that the EVRi delivery driver threw onto my property, like a young American paper boy delivering a newspaper, was undamaged. Probably because you wrapped the parcel very well. It is exactly as described, and I am pleased that it arrived on time. All-in-all, I an reasonably happy. However, I am disgruntled by your choice of couriers! Until you change your courier from EVRi, to any other reputable service, I will simply stop shopping with you.EVRi have made a living hell for all of their customers - just read the reviews! Personally, I have never had a good experience with these people. They are awful. You will end up losing money, as a company, just compensating their incompetence. My advice; dump EVRi - and do it yesterday, if possible.",1,29/03/2024
Been using temu  a lot all the orders iv had have been really good .But iv got a wind chime that one of the crystal  is missing .Would like to hear from some on or have a email to use  please  The girls dresses are amazing Got table fans they are also very good .Every thing is good apart from my chime,5,29/03/2024

Ordered a week ago and was excited to receive but have received the completely wrong order. Have to wait for a refund before them sending again. I think it should be sent again now. Very disappointing. Not sure I want to re-order due to lack of trust,1,29/03/2024
I?€?ve been shopping with Temu now for a couple of months and have to say while you think it?€?s too good to be true with the prices they are actually really good.The products are good and I?€?ve had a wide range of items from electronics to clothes.  They arrive within a good time frame and the up to date tracking is also helpful.I also love the games for free items although they do become a bit addictive lol and I?€?ve won a lot off of the games so I can say they are defo not a scam.100% happy with customer service as well very quick to respond to enquiries and also very quick with returns and refunds.  So far I have not had any issues.,5,29/03/2024
"To be honest I do not understand the negative review, I have been shopping on Temu before everyone talked about it, so far so good to be honest, even when I did receive some items damaged, straight refund without returning!

I?€?ve never had that experience with SHEIN or other e-commerce companies before. First time buying products at Temu and guess what! Nothing arrived. I was waiting for the delivery and it was not there. Speedx didn?€?t not delivery the package.,1,29/03/2024

"Curiosty got the better of me so i downloaded the app and started shopping.Crazy low prices but the old adage of 'you get what you pays for' rings trueGoods arrived earlier earlier than expected so it was so far so good.Tea Shirt looks good as does the cap. The 2 pairs of cheap trainers for messing about in look like they'll fall apart after a couple of outings so not good.The extendable hose that's supposed to stretch 50 feet manages abour 20 feet so useless for what i needed it for.Not the best quality by a long way but I only paid ??20 for everything.If you don't mind cheap tat then fine, it'll be right up your street, but it's not for me.App now deleted as I won't be using again.As a footnote, be prepared to be bombarded by emails with once in a lifetime offers.",2,30/03/2024

"I have placed and received 2 orders, a 3rd will be made as soon as I finish this review. Tempu is not a scam. Some prices are ridiculously cheap, when compared to similar items purchased in the UK. All means is UK shops are making huge profit margins.  There is no doubt the very cheap prices reflects cheap construction and materials.  Before you start complaining understand you got it dirt cheap. If you want better pay more for better goods.Recently,  I bought 2 pairs of shoes.  As a rule I never buy shoes on line, but this time I gave it a go, 2 pairs for ??35 post free. The pictures made them look great. In reality they were disappointing.  One pair are wearable and proved to be ok to look at and comfortable.  The other pair are too tight, they will be sold on Ebay,  I will probably make a profit on them. Both orders have arrived early. Be warned, the same item will appear several times with different prices. Tempu is a bit like Ebay or Amazon.  Loads of individual sellers,  often competing against each other.  It's a pity they don't have a readable feedback score. The website not the easiest to navigate.  Trying to search for an item in order of low to high results in masses of non related cheap junk and impossible to see what you are looking for. So far the best way of searching, for me, is the default relative method and just keep scrolling to the end. The photo of goods is of a high,  most of the time.  This makes the goods look better than they are. Sizes can be unreliable.  Read reviews. Almost anything described as leather is not. I gave up looking for a 100% cotton mans short sleeved shirt.  Everything is polyester or, at best, cotton mix.Be prepared to spend a lot of time looking and comparing products.  I don't think you can find the same item in the UK for the same or cheaper.",4,30/03/2024
"I have read the negative reviews of Temu, so I was apprehensive about ordering from app. I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. All orders delivered quickly, good quality affordable items with free delivery. After my first order, I ordered more, same quick delivery and good quality items as described. Shoes and clothes perfect fit. I use a number of shopping apps so far Temu is really good.",5,30/03/2024

"To all intents and purpose it's similar products to something like Ali Express, and the prices if you weigh them is about the same. As is the case with that, you have to watch what you buy, cheap knockoffs of certain things are better than others.What I like about it is it accepts Google Play credits, which is useful for the currency I build on there via opinion rewards and gives me something tangible to buy with them.",5,30/03/2024
Goods arrived advertised as linen But all polyester that?€?s not cotton or linen.Breach of description If something is advertised as linen it should be linen or a blend.Not polyesterReply:?€?Asked for details lol Goods advertised as linen were polyester ?€?What more can you sayWhen final package arrives I will send pictures to them of labelsI was negligent in thinking it would be as advertised.Wish I could do it here2nd reply Reply is stock answer further to this a garden hose was advertised with a nozzle gun but arrived without this is apart from the non linen items.The goods described are not what you getA few were passable but I would not wear them so I shall lose my ??80 as (Te Moo ) do not respond only to offer taking goods back that?€?s not the issue I?€?m missing the nozzle gun and things were not as described Why should I send things back that are clearly inferior I?€?ve sent pictures of labels on goods showing they are polyester not linen and they are available for Trustpilot if you wish to set them I?€?ve sent to TEMU,1,30/03/2024
Happy with everything I've had off here so farShipping is fast and they keep you updated every step of the way. The games are a must if you sign in everyday and keep on top of them. I've won so much stuff now Ive been super lucky. If you search 429160001 in the normal search bar on the app it should bring up either cash rewards or 10 free gifts game for you,5,30/03/2024

"I have ordered a couple of things from Temu. The first was a child?€?s baseball cap - cheap enough not to worry about if it all went wrong. It didn?€?t. The cap arrived before the estimated delivery date and was lovely. So then I became a bit braver and ordered a dress. Only ??8.49. It too arrived before the estimated delivery date. The quality is not great - no washing instructions, the buttons fell off as soon as I looked at them but over all a very pretty dress which looks great and has washed well and received several compliments. Have I just been lucky? I may consider a third order to find out?€?",5,30/03/2024

I am so pleasantly surprised. The hat and dress has arrived in time for my festival and they are perfect colour and size.

"Ordered two pairs of shoes. Wrong size came. Had to return them which I did and they duly credited on their app. However, when I tried to buy the same shoes again, they said I owed more.

"To date I?€?ve been happy with all my purchases. 1st of July was my latest delivery. Cheap, cheerful, tops/trousers.When buying clothing look at the size guide for that garment.

Overall I have had a very positive experience shopping with TEMU",5,30/03/2024
"I've ordered few items on Temu to be able to get my own view on their quality. I have returned 2 out of 5 items.

"It?€?s touch and go with this site, they need to check out their shops and don?€?t buy from shops that sell inferior goods and pass them on to customers, maybe then they can build a better reputation. Many things are fine but also many are pure junk and deemed for the rubbish bin on arrival. The customers should really leave a review on the product and the shop. We would then recognise the trashy sellers and avoid them, that?€?s in everyone?€?s interests.please Temu where do we find a reference number which you require when we make a negative review?",3,30/03/2024
Hit and miss with this company in regards to the quality of the item. Some are really cheap and nasty but there is the odd few things that are ok. Shipping is pretty slow. I?€?ve found a lot of adverts to be very misleading too in regards to size and quality of items. Only gave it a try due to the opening sales and free delivery but I can?€?t ever see me buying from there once they add the delivery charge.,3,30/03/2024
"Of two identical pillow fills I ordered, one was flat, the other one did not match, and none were the size shown in my search results.  Of three shorts in the same order, two were different length, and the third one had a waistband so twisted that I could neither wear them, nor fix the lastic as it was sewn in all turned around.  I tried to return my order, but they didn't want it back.  They also did not give me a refund, which resulted in me cancelling the Discover card I charged it to.  TEMU did not acknowledge my dissatisfaction with their merchandise at all.Follow-through after TEMU's reply: I did all that and was told by TEMU's online responses that there was no need to return any merchandise.  Selecting a refund to my Discover card had me stuck in TEMU's alledged ""purchase protection"" option that claimed over and over that I was not selecting a credit card to send the refund to, although I clearly selected Discover, over and over.  I am done trying to work with this company.  After having a Discover card for nearly 30 years, this has even put me at odds with them and I'm in the process of closing my account.  Without paying TEMU.  I'm so turned off, they can both go to hell.",1,31/03/2024

"Review:    I recently had the pleasure of using the TEMU Shopping App, and I must say it has become my go-to platform for all my shopping needs. In these challenging times of rising inflation, TEMU has truly emerged as a lifesaver, offering exceptional deals, top-notch products, and unbeatable prices that support customers like me.    One of the standout features of TEMU is the incredible range of products available. Whether I?€?m looking for household essentials, electronics, fashion items, or even groceries, TEMU has it all. The app?€?s user-friendly interface makes browsing through their extensive catalogue a breeze, and I can easily find what I need with just a few taps.    What sets TEMU apart from other shopping apps is the value it provides. Despite the current inflationary climate, TEMU manages to offer competitive prices that are often lower than those found in physical stores or other online platforms. I?€?ve been pleasantly surprised by the savings I?€?ve made on numerous occasions. It?€?s a relief to know that I can still enjoy quality products without stretching my budget too thin.    Speaking of quality, TEMU maintains a high standard when it comes to the products they offer. I have purchased various items through the app, and each time I have been impressed by the excellent quality. From durable electronics to stylish clothing, TEMU ensures that its customers receive nothing but the best. The reassurance of knowing that I?€?m investing in products that will stand the test of time is invaluable.    Furthermore, TEMU?€?s customer support deserves a special mention. Whenever I?€?ve had a query or encountered any issues, their team has been prompt, efficient, and genuinely helpful. Their commitment to ensuring customer satisfaction is commendable, and it further reinforces my trust in the company.    In conclusion, TEMU Shopping App is an outstanding platform that provides great deals, good-quality products, and affordable prices, even in times of rising inflation. It has become my preferred choice for all my shopping needs, offering convenience, savings, and reliability. If you?€?re looking for a shopping app that supports you during these challenging economic times, I highly recommend giving TEMU a try.",5,31/03/2024
"Ordered second order whilst waiting for first to arrive. Shouldn't have bothered. Clothes which were described as linen or cotton have all been cheap nasty polyester. I ordered shoes in both my orders. Both size 5... received a size 4 and a size 3. Although customer service have refunded these they have point blank refused to resend at the price I initially paid. I paid ??7.57 for both pairs, if I reorder it would be at ??24.58 and Temu seem to think that is perfectly fair despite it being their fault. I have sent 75% of order one back and 100% of order two. But now concerned I won't actually get any money back.Find it interesting that Temu are only responding to positive reviews. Shows how little they care.",1,31/03/2024

I especially love the jewelry (I ordered diamond rings that were $1.87 and they really look like real diamonds. I love the earrings, ankle bracelets, hair accessories, makeup, and even have had great success with some clothing I ordered (shorts and PJs). I did order 2 dresses that I didn?€?t like and they gave me a credit rather than having me return them. I have also received a $5.00 credit when my order did not arrive in the time stated by Temu.

I ordered two different Chinese plasters for my knee and spine which I have a lot of pain ,gone when I apply these.Plastic plants look so real ,I have put them in pots in the garden .I cannot fault anything .Last week I made a mistake on an order before I realised ,I messaged them and a refund was made straight away and in my account the next day .Give it a try it?€?s well worth it .",5,31/03/2024
"OMG don?€?t do it, luckily I only spent a few quid, when the stuff comes it?€?s nothing like it looked in the picture. I ordered a rug looked amazing on the site, when it came it?€?s like the inside of a cheap quilt with a printed picture on. Second item I ordered was a large canvass and got a rolled up paper picture. Had to Laugh for being stupid enough in the first place to actually believe it.

I've bought clothes for myself too which are unusual, colourful and good quality. It's my go to shop now",5,31/03/2024

The other 2 items were as it said . All in all no real problems",4,31/03/2024
Disappointed. The Items are the same as wish. But with free shipping. So the quality of stuff is wish quality. You can shop like a billionaire but won't look like one. The clothes look nice in photos but quality is paper thin and very flimsy. The jewelry is exactly the stuff on wish. And everything else of substandard quality. So thumbs down to this site.

"I am not a typical online shopper ........ and, therefore, tried Temu a couple of months ago for the first time, with a minimal order value of $15. Firstly, the communication was exceedingly efficient with tracking my order and progress thereof regularly ! Deliveries are made within 10 days using NZ Post as their courier. You get exactly what you ordered and I haven't returned anything as yet, so a bit unsure how that process will pan out..... I've used them 6 times up to now and I know I will, from now on, be on the lookout for that orange parcel on my doorstep ! Items ordered included garden, kitchen, electrical, medical and gadgets ! An issue, maybe, might be the inability to specify on the order the type of electrical plug (Type-I) for NZ use......Overall, surprisingly good service, excellent prices, speedy free delivery and the only reason I give only 4 stars is that it always seem inappropriate to give full marks or 5-stars !",4,01/04/2024

The customer service spouts the same rubbish like you are talking to an autobot.I have had 2 parcels left on the front of my house apparently but, I have not received them. The 1st parcel was refunded under their protection promise but the 2nd time they say it can't be refunded that they are satisfied that it has been delivered ???? I'm not satisfied it has been delivered because it clearly hasn't. My next parcel that came the day later, dropped again on my front apparently. Spotted by a family member that took the parcel in for me. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SITE!! YOU MAY AS WELL JUST GIVE THEM THE MONEY.EDITRead the reply!! They lie. The protection promise is rubbish. They tell me that ""they have investigated and are satisfied that my parcel was delivered....and can not offer a refund/new delivery""SCAMMERS SCAMMERS SCAMMERS",1,01/04/2024
"I'm literally looking at the items ordered, a first for me with Temu.  Listen, don't expect high end products. Everything I received was cheaply made but unlike others who have complained, my expectations were low,  which was based on the price of these items. Don't expect a $15 item to be the equivalent to an item that is $450. Use your common sense when buying products with Temu. It's just like Wish, cheap items at low prices... like going to the dollar store.  You get what you paid for.  I gave it a 3 star bc more than that eludes to items being incredible. Cheap items, so be selective. My package included ten items, all cheaply made but good for what I needed: Umbrella, backpack, duffel bag, little tool kit, etc.",3,01/04/2024
"This is my honest review based on just two shipments so far. The shipping time of course is longer than with Amazon but still not bad as in 8 to 11 days. I ordered a couple quartz clock moments that included the hands for $1.50 and $2.00 while the big A had a much smaller selection running from $8 to $11. Another item was a small solar panel which was identical to the one on A for significantly less. It was solid with all the hardware for my outside web cam. The other stuff was small filler items like a $.99 computer keyboard cleaner. Cheap and actually works. So in all, I'll be ordering from them again.",5,01/04/2024
"I have ordered from Temu 3 or 4 times, never an issue, for the price you pay items are good",5,01/04/2024
"Second order. Everything as described in both orders (make sure you read description, materials and sizes carefully). Sent two items back from this order as they were too big. Free returns and fully refunded to my account. All great!",5,01/04/2024
I've placed three combined orders with TeMu. Everything arrived very quickly. All the items were as described - the prices were very competitive. Let's hope their service remains at this high level.,5,01/04/2024
I put in an order eleven days ago no tracking information about where my package is nor when it would arrive. I have told all my friends you guys ARE NOT TRUST WORTHY AND YOU ARE STEALING CUSTOMERS MONEY.,1,01/04/2024
Great price on what I wanted and quality was excellent. Delivered quickly with a proviso that if was not delivered as stated they would credit me with ??5.,5,01/04/2024
"Fast shipping, free returns, sounds like risk free but not if your items are not of the quality expected and you decide to make a return, if you send several items back in one package they can falsely claim that they didn't recieve some of those items and decide to not issue you a refund. They think most people will not chase them for few dollars items but not me! it's difficult to speak to an actual person you'll have to get through 2-3 bots before you can reach one. I say if it's not a small item i prefer paying alil extra and getting it from amazon where you know for sure that they will not cheat you if you needed to make a return",2,01/04/2024
I?€?m very upset with my order from this company?€?I ordered a lace wig and it wasn?€?t like the picture and it smells and also i ordered a waist trainer belt and it was to small,1,01/04/2024
"I've ordered several times from Temu always delivered within time frame and able to be tracked on Evri. All items were as described, mainly craft items, and excellent value for money.",5,02/04/2024
"Like a lot of other sites I thought it was to good to be true on pricing. Paid by paypal for security and any come back. Needn't have worried, order in within a few days. All good on this occasion.",5,02/04/2024
"After reading some reviews was a bit nervous ordering from temu but did anyway and can honest say it is one of the best company i have dealt with. Super fast delivery, refunds no problem, very cheap, and good quality goods. I wish all companies were like this have ordered now several time now and delivery seems to get quicker.",5,02/04/2024
I have placed 8 orders with Temu over the past months totalling around $500 and have been extremely happy with ALL the items I have purchased.  It is extremely good for craft supply.  Have shared with friends.  Use to be an avid Ali express customer but now with free delivery and fast delivery to Australia I only shop Temu now.,5,02/04/2024
"After reading horror stories about Temu, but also the other side of things saying it was akin to AliExpress, which I have mainly had good experiences with, I decided to give it a go - and I was not disappointed. The items I ordered were mainly haircare and jewellery/beading/craft supplies. I was advised of the delivery period, and the parcel arrived on the first day of that window (eight days after I put in my order). Everything was included, and was of the quality seen in the photos. I am very pleased with my first order and will be ordering again.",5,02/04/2024
Scam company promising prices in their ads that do not meet what is advertised on their official site. Their app has been flagged for malware as well since they're a property of the scum Chinese government. AVOID!,1,02/04/2024
"I love temu I and never had a bad experience with this company or delivery's yes you wait a couple of weeks or so and expected when parcels come from china. They keep there's prices lower then any online shopping I have used so far, they certainly know how to treat there customers especially with the cost of living. So thank you temu ?????? one happy customer ????",5,02/04/2024
"The delivery was prompt and arrived exactly as promised. The products' quality was satisfactory considering the prices. Overall, it was a good experience, except for the return procedure, which could be improved. The return process requires printing out the return slip and personally delivering the packages to the nearest courier partners, which can be time-consuming compared to Amazon",4,02/04/2024
"I?€?d never used Temu before and was dubious. I ordered 3 items for an upcoming holiday. I paid by PayPal just in case of issues. Order due for delivery by 3rd July.My order arrived on 29th June via Evri. I could track my order in the app throughout the waiting period. Happy with my items. Based on this experience I would order again, but would always pay by PayPal.",5,02/04/2024
Excellent company money was back in my account with in two days,5,02/04/2024
"I placed an order that I never received!  From this store ""Temu"" they did not refund me the amount of money!  Despite everything, the store brazenly wrote in my profile that my package was delivered to another address!!!I would NOT recommend this fraudulent store under any circumstances, Really!!!",1,02/04/2024
"I absolutely love this site, I find everything I want on there and have never been disappointed. It's got my vote!",5,02/04/2024
"Like many, I thought this company's offers may be too good to be true, my first order was dealt with promptly, all confirmations and information timely and precise. Delivery within the time stated and items were all as described, have already placed further orders and hoping this standard of service continues.",5,02/04/2024
Have placed four orders recently and I very pleasantly surprised by the speed they arrived( after only a week) and also the quality of the items I bought.Very pleased. Will certainly order more in future.,5,02/04/2024
"First time dealing with Temu has been a mixed experience,I ordered a wall clock, which arrived with a totally shattered glass face, via the ""help line"" I was promptly given a refund on the spot.... I reordered the same item which was delivered today with,,,, would you believe a broken glass face.I have removed the glass pieces and the clock is working fine, but it is incomplete, so I am not very happy, The manufactured must be informed, to insure ample protection  during transit of these items. Cheers. John.",3,02/04/2024
"Temu have delivered 15 seperate orders to me on time since 11-01-2022, and I have never missed any orders yet. You got what you paid for.",5,02/04/2024
"Only good experience so far. I ordered in may for the first time and it was longer delivery time but all items were good quality, nothing was broken and I am happy that I got some stationary that is not overpriced like on amazon. Legit the same things but more than three times more expensive. Today I got my third oder and still happy.",5,02/04/2024
"It?€?s really great. So much stuff to choose from, fast delivery and good prices. I?€?ve had over ten orders now and no problems. Lovely range of items too, definitely recommend. If you search 428589608 in the app you can play a farm game to win prizes ??????",5,02/04/2024
"The goods are fine most of the time it is the return process that takes FOREVER! some of the clothes do not fit, so I sent them back. Tracking on Evri says returned already just over a week later, but chat agent says they still have to wait for it to arrive at the warehouse!!! Said I must wait patiently for up to 14 days before the refund. So if returning goods, don't expect to get a refund before 14 days ( and I haven't got it yet, so who knows how long it will actually take in the end?)",2,02/04/2024
"I was sceptical to start with, it seemed too good to be true with the low level of prices. The first order went missing, and I thought yep scam. But I was automatically refunded the cost, with compensation that I hadn't requested. So I ordered again, this time no issues with the order and delivery was perfect. I am a naturally cautious person, so placed another order, again no issues. The quality of the items were excellent, but I still can't believe the price of the items being so low. But can't fault them.",5,02/04/2024

What I would like here, is to at least see my credit for the first two items returned, which should be with you by now,so we can continue forward. Because it's been more than 3min.

"Had first 2 orders and temu managed to send the packages with a complete different postal adress then mine. The first package got refunded after a heavy discussion and i noted, that the second order also might have the same problem. They said it was already labeled and out for delivery so the adress cpuldnt be changed. Mysteriously the 2nd package never got refunded , they stated that the package was delivered at the right destination even tho DHL verified the package was wrongly labeled by temu to an unknown adres.. horrible company and cuatomer service dont buy here!",1,03/04/2024
I opened the Temu app and was told to spin a wheel and was told that I worn ??100 and instructed to pick 3 items. I picked three items and checked out only to be debited without a instruction on how to get the ??100 I was told that I worn. I have sent a message on the app and no reply was given only the details of the order I paid for could be found.,1,03/04/2024
"My daughter and I have definitely got the temu bug, I?€?ve made 5 orders now and she has had 3. Everything spot on. Delivery updates are great. Every time I see an add for something on Facebook or insta, I check temu and it?€?s always a fraction of the price. There?€?s literally nothing you can?€?t buy here. Awesome place to buy from",5,03/04/2024
I was a bit worried to use this site because it seemed too good to be true however I was very pleasantly surprised. I loved everything I ordered. The dresses were perfect. I didn?€?t need to return anything which is a first for me as usually when I order from Dorothy Perkins of marks I have to do. This will now be my main shopping site I use.,5,03/04/2024

"TEMU is terrific.  I have placed 4 orders over the last 5 months and everything has been delivered in good condition and the merchandise exactly as described.  The people I have dealt with have been pleasant, knowledgeable, accurate and professional.  I have a 120# Akita who is my service dog and the rain coat i ordered him was way too small ... my fault I'm sure ... but we regifted it to one of Ted's much smaller dog buddies, so that worked out fine too.  look forward to continuing to shop with Temu.",5,03/04/2024
"I have deleted Temu App. My last order came broken in pieces, they refunded but non the less is was cheap junk. They asked Trustpilot fir me to provide my telephone number which I stupidly did and I don?€?t know why. I blocked them from daily emails and they continue to send me messages somehow  , disregarding my blocks or me unsubscribing. Something is not right. I would not use this App ever again",1,03/04/2024
Bought a few items to test out this company - stuff is poor quality & cheap material definitely will not shop here again on the up side only cost me ??10 in total - for a few pounds more I'll shop at Shein better quality products,2,03/04/2024
So far so good. Although new to app,5,03/04/2024
"I have ordered two lots of goods from Temu and delivery has been excellent, for the money I am really pleased with the quality of my items shoes tops etc. one of my items was faulty Temu refunded me within minutes of me informing them ,for me a good company and I will continue to use them in the future .",5,03/04/2024
"I got my delivery today a day late and I ordered 3 bags one was ok the other 2 was absolutely rubbish,I also ordered a three strand necklace and trying to put it on and it broke so in the bin ???? so disappointed in the goods",1,03/04/2024
"Where to start? I was very suspicious about ordering from temu but there was really no need. I initially downloaded the temu app to see what the hype was about, of course some products are wasteful junk but some are actually very useful and supsringly cheap. Free delivery promotion on with their summer sale and free returns, had a good browse and found a few items that had my interest, so I thought why not free delivery and returns, I would of actually spent more elsewhere for one of the items I purchased than I spent for the whole order which was a shocker. I placed my order and while it was processing, I found this amazing feature where you can add more products to your initial order without extra charges (just pay for the product), well this app restocks constantly because I found another item 1/4 of the price I'd be paying elsewhere and added that to my first order. So this is where you either get a great experience with temu or an okay experience, Items were shipped out using Royal Mail delivery method and to my suprise turned up 5 days later. (23rd order date-28th delivery date). What in the world, so fast at shipping and I had a pre order item too. If you get the short straw (Hermes) you'll be waiting longer. (Tried and tested with a second order placed at the exact same time. Hasn't turned up yet.) The Products ordered arrived quickly, and again to my suprise are actually good quality, they also have the correct CE markings for example and supposedly conform to UK electrical standards. I ordered a t-shirt, the sizing compared to branded items is just a little out, larger than you'd expect. I decided to return this item as I would of preferred a smaller one. Here's where this really shocks me and to be honest makes me want to use the app again, I initiated a return request for the 1 item, stated the reason and the system auto refunded me without shipping being needed. (They say please keep it, recycle it, or donate it. ) What is this app/site, it's bloody brilliant. (PS please keep free delivery option and get rid of Hermes ????).",4,03/04/2024
"BEWARE!! TEMU is like WISH. It's a scam. You can not ""win"" anything free from them. ESPECIALLY on the game FISHLAND. Closer you get to the amount to win they throttle the amount you earn as well as cut back the amount of food you can feed the fish! It's deceptive, bait and switch, dishonest! And orders come from CHINA, Therefore impossible to receive within the 7 days they claim. They'll blame airlines for canceled flights. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME and MONEY!",1,03/04/2024
"Absolutely incredible. Cannot fault them at all. Super fast with delivery, love the products, prices are amazing. Contacted customer service about a delivery query no issues at all, super polite and professional. No waiting for someone to join the conversation they were in the chat within a minute. Ross is incredible. I will definitely be using this company forever",5,03/04/2024
i ordered a day later my bank account was cleaned out,1,03/04/2024
Started shopping on here a few weeks after it launched in the UK. I've made 50 orders so far. Some of it being free from playing the games. Search 428489909 to join the game. Everything I've had has been amazing quailty. The clothes beat other similar websites by miles and the shipping is alot faster. I'm suprised it's not got a higher rating.,5,03/04/2024
I have so far placed 3 orders with Temu; a mix of clothes and household items.  All I can say is they have been extremely good with communication; returns and refunds.  I had some issue with sizing but they were so good with live chat too.  Quality has been so far good too - one happy customer ????,5,04/04/2024
I ordered and received my goods very quickly. I was concerned when I saw lots of negative reviews but I am happy with the goods I received. Everything is good quality and clothing is true to size. Delivery was very quick and came by Evrie. Pleasantly surprised,5,04/04/2024
Quality goods. I have so far ordered 3 times and never been disappointed. Free postage. Prompt despatch,5,04/04/2024
"Temu got my order to me within the period they said it would ship, I bought a bunch of things, decorations, lights, etc. they tracked the shipping on their app every day updating me with where my orders were and they came within 10 days! Very happy with my experience because I thought the incredibly low prices were too good to be true. Turned out it was great, and good quality decorations. I will be shopping with Temu again.",5,04/04/2024
"Using wrong app, I have now found it should be sguare shaped as linked with Trustpilot, guideline recommendations.  First delivery of order completed ??10.00 minimum and to obtain free delivery.Order arrived by courier very quickly, no problems whatsoever.  Quality of products ordered very good despite being so cheap.  Items to buy are individually priced and appear to be made made of sustainable discarded plastic and other materials which can be remade and reused, for example refills/replacements.",5,04/04/2024
"I received my order on 22nd May. The quality was disappointing, so I returned it the same day. I cannot get my money back. I would not recommend Temu.Refund received 29th June. Thank you.",1,04/04/2024
This is my 2nd review and after approx 6 more orders from Temu nothing has changed since my 1st review.I highly recommend this company.,5,04/04/2024
Very poor packaging and delivery. I ordered several items and they all arrived in damaged squashed boxes. Would not use again for this issue.,1,04/04/2024
"I am extremely pleased with Temu!  This site is legitimate, pricing is awesome, and for the most part, the products  are very high quality.  I?€?ve always been an Amazon Prime customer, but I just recently started using Temu, have placed over 5 orders and they?€?ve all arrived relatively quickly and included everything ordered.  I did want to return several items and they approved all of them and gave me the option for a site credit or refund back to my payment type, and did not require return of the items.  I highly recommend Temu!",5,04/04/2024
"Delivery and return were easy.Some goods| (watch) was not as advertised but had5 star feedback. So dont rely on it, buy only if your friends can recommend an item.",4,04/04/2024

"I have done a few orders on Temu and all the time i don?€?t receive all the items i ordered, i asked for refund following the procedure from customer support and they denied the refund. Its just bad organisation, even with the proof of the pictures or video they don?€?t give the money back. PO-210-00089695447672040 This was the order i placed of they want to check. Inside the package i found a empty bag of the shoes i bought from my daughter. It was clear someone stolen ot. Bad organisation, avoid to use this app.",1,04/04/2024

"Super fast shipping, great prices. I have placed three huge orders and maybe gotten two or three dud products, but the cost is so low, I threw them out. Most items are of surprising quality for the price. I will try clothing in my next order, but I haven?€?t ordered any yet. My favorites are kitchen and garden goodies.",5,04/04/2024
"Downloaded the app and participated in one if their promotions- get new users to download the app and get free gifts. I got 4 people to download, 3 verified never had the app or used temu. Temu refuses to honor the promotion because they stated that they were not new users. They essentially insinuated I was a liar and offered me 5 dollars in credit and 20 percent of a purchase of 20 dollars. Very scammy, an hour with customer service was an hour wasted as they refuse to honor their own promotion. My first and last experienceEdit for response by Temu-Temu places this response on a lot of reviews, however I already spoke to your customer service. They were unhelpful. Since I posted this, I've read multiple reviews on multiple platforms that list concerns similar to mind. You are scamming people, if not out of money directly, out of time, misleading them and acting dishonestly.",1,04/04/2024
I originally sent a bad report on cover shoes that I bought fromTEMUTemu have credited he amount and apologised for the article not to my liking.,4,04/04/2024

"Items have been as described, been fantastic value for money, customer service has been fantastic if any questions, only ever had 1 issue with delivery but that was the delivery company at fault not the temu staff",5,05/04/2024
"Was sceptical, but several orders later I can not emphasise how good the stuff is , I have bought a wide range of items , ( not tried any woman?€?s clothing yet )  all but two items were well made and did what they were supposed to do, the two items were a motion sensor light that just stayed on and some slimming pants that were too big ( well made though) my refund was near instant, no problems at all , It appears to be a professional company who have extremely good customer care. It?€?s an easy site to navigate , you get regular parcel tracking emails. Deliver always well within the time frame. Word of warning ?????? you find a mountain of things you didn?€?t know you wanted, it?€?s a very addictive site , but a very cheap addiction ????can?€?t praise the products and services enough ,I did not receive any free items or gain anything to write a good review",5,05/04/2024
"Temu has great prices and timely delivery. Great refund policy even if the price changes after you order. My one issue that might seem PETTY is this: DO NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH FREE ADVERTISING WHEN THEY LURE You WITH FREE GIFTS. It?€?s like holding a carrot in front of a horse. Always soooo close. For me it was a complete waste of my time and therefore back to Ali Express I go. I felt like a fool sending those links for a free gift then following up to let them know the request was legit, when in actuality I was basically spamming my contacts by providing free advertising for TEMU. I told them I was going to submit a review now they?€?re requesting more information from me or my review will come down??? Take it down if you please. At least I got it out.",2,05/04/2024
"I've ordered 3 times now from them, great quality, everything works and this website is legit. Deliveries are fast and in fact I get my deliveries 1 day before which is fantastic!

I absolutley recommend using them, try them out, they have a lot to offer!",5,05/04/2024
"I was abit weary about ordering from Temu ,because of the cheap prices ,I have ordered my daughter's whole summer wardrobe from here the quality is good and prices are amazing ,fast delivery was a bonus too.",5,05/04/2024
"I must admit that I am really surprised. All products are well made and have a very good quality. All the items are so super cute and don?€?t look cheap. None of the products have a chemical smell and all items work perfectly. The order was uncomplicated, the tracking was seamless and the delivery was very fast. I am very happy with the delivery.",5,05/04/2024
"I placed an order with them and the order showed delivered but I didn?€?t receive a thing. There were 2 people home all day and other packages from other vendors were delivered. When I contacted customer service, they instructed me to file a police report and send them a copy. I deleted the app and will never shop with them again. This was not my first order and the others arrived without issue.EDIT: The copy and paste response solves NOTHING with my issue and the ?€?protection plan?€? protects the company not the consumer. No other company wastes the consumer?€?s time and law enforcement resources to submit a police report for a $40 mishandled delivery. I?€?m keeping my review at 1 star due to the fact that nothing was resolved.",1,05/04/2024
"Absolutely brilliant, purchased with caution but no need it's all arrived and really good stuff, tyvm",5,05/04/2024
"Right so you order a minimum of ??10. Everything was well and all, got it right before their deadline but when I open it I already knew it wasnt what I ordered but I just thought it was the multiple pieces I got. I got a big glass jug, broken. When I opened it I did not get what i ordered. Literally, never buy from here, you won't get what you ordered and what you will get will be broken. A horrible website",1,05/04/2024
Very fast dispatch and delivery (despite using Evri). Items excellent value for money. I was a little uneasy about buying from Temu after reading the reviews but I was happy with both delivery and product. Time will tell if this was a one off.,5,05/04/2024
"I have had 3 orders now and find the company to be very responsive. Have been satisfied with most of clothing, only 2 of 8 had size issues.  Very satisfied with craft and nail products, beautiful and very good value. Some products not used yet.  Pay close attention to measurements of all items as some smaller than expected.",4,06/04/2024
"Have used this Temu site for several orders. Fist order small as I was not sure if they were legit, but now know they are. Simple order process, quick delivery?€?s and simple and efficient returns policy and process if needed - I have only returned 2 items from a total of about 20items , and I will be buying morel",5,06/04/2024
My eye caught how cheap this site was let's face it cost of everything going up in price today we all look for a bargain...10 items of clothing for ??30 where could you get an offer as good as that....the quality wasn't what I expected...I thought this cheap surely the clothes won't be that good...what a shock I got...the quality was fantastic soft linen clothing from crop trousers with t-shirts to summer linen dresses...so glad I ordered now I've got my summer wardrobe ready...would certainly recommend temu to everyone looking for a bargain with quality,5,06/04/2024
"My first order was delivered elsewhere, and the proof of delivery photo only proved it wasn't my front door. Upon reading the reviews, it appears a lot of parcels don't get delivered, very bizarre. Nevertheless, I immediately contacted TEMU via Live Chat and explained the situation. The company offered me a refund without any hesitation as if they knew I would be contacting them. Anyways, I wanted the items so I asked for another delivery. When I asked them to confirm my address, they said their software doesn't allow them to see my address via Live Chat, but they would guarantee it would arrive this time. Very bizarre! Anyway, the order did arrive, and I've placed 3 further orders since, and had no problems with delivery. With regards to the products, it's hit and miss. Some are good quality, and some are terrible. But, as the old adage goes... you get what you paid for. I noticed many people here have refused to use the company again, and this is exactly how I felt when my first order wasn't delivered. But, I am glad I gave them a 2nd chance. In the words of Forest Gump, 'S**t Happens' so why stress over things out of our control? Funny how reviews are typically left 'only' when someone is unhappy.Note to Temu: It might be a good idea to publish all reviews on your site, and not just 4* & 5* ones.",4,06/04/2024
"Very good site, very good quality items, delivery on time/ very fast. I absolutely recommend.",5,06/04/2024
I know the items are cheap but the quality of the products I ordered were unbelievably poor. I won't be buying from them again,1,06/04/2024
"I have purchased several batches from Temu. Their delivery to NZ was quicker than Aliexpress and I did not missed any package. If I received total 3 items that did not match with what their advertisement, I have gotten the full refund without returning the items. Their refund service is so quick. I like it better than Aliexpress.",5,06/04/2024
I returned my parcel three weeks ago. And I still didnt receieve the refund. I tried to contact with the customer service and they didnt help me to solve this issue.order no:PO-210-17218112205432317,1,06/04/2024
"Had two orders. Both orders were held in shipping in va. On Sunday get got delivered notice at 5am Monday.Notice says delivered. No packaged delivered. Asked for refund to original card. Received email say received .04cent credit on Temu account. Check Temu site for orders and say?€?s refunded. Can not recommend this company for anyone to use, as if I don?€?t receive refund due in full I?€?ll keep posting negative reviews on all sites and bbb and all other sites that  potential customers check before using web sites",1,06/04/2024
"I ordered a simple dimple fidget popper. It came in a week. Works great, came in a nice bag, free shipping! Temu is a good place to buy cheap things. But I wouldn't buy something more expensive just in case the quality isn't great. Some have been saying that theirs came defective or even that they ordered something else than what they got.Temu is good, but make sure to buy more expensive things on other, more reliable sites Edit: I found out that Temu is currently having a $15 limit for every purchase. Was 5 stars, now it's 4.",4,06/04/2024
"Ordered twice no issues. The quality of products are good for the price you pay. Personally was positively surprised. Fairly quick delivery considering it?€?s coming from abroad. Would definitely recommend if you want affordable clothes. I bought few pair of leggins, trousers and hair bands.",5,06/04/2024
Lovely items quick delivery very happy indeed,5,06/04/2024
Ordered items on the Sunday On Monday I received a tracking number for EVRI.  A week later EVRI's tracking still states we are expecting it.Have emailed Temu but got no reply.Obviously they have no intention of sending what I ordered just want my money and nothing in return,1,06/04/2024
"Im not sure why there are one star reviews on here. My experience has been phenomenal. I have won free gifts more than once. The prices are great, I have made several orders with them so far, and everything has been exactly as described. I only had one mishap-  One order went missing, but they fully refunded (This was also without me inquiring. They contacted me first, informed me it was missing and the money was already on my account). They also gave me an extra 5 dollar credit because of their delivery time guarantee. It then showed up anyways a week later! Im very happy to have found Temu.",5,06/04/2024
HORRIBLE SITE! They keep cancelling orders and we have tried multiple methods of for payment but each order gets rejected stating its a suspicious order.Managers are no help. I have started to order direct from the manufactures that sell on TEMU instead. They will honour the price with free shipping without having to deal with TEMU,1,06/04/2024
"I've purchased many random items from Temu - from clothes & shoes to miscallaneous tools to hair clips.75 to 80% of the items were exactly what I wanted. They're fine. Some of the item quailty is equivalent to Harbour Freight or Dollar General but at half the price or less.Some of the items are better quality like you find at Walmart or even high end stores.Some of the items were smaller than I realized or cheaper quality but were less than $1 so who cares? Still useable.Some shoes I got were smaller. I simply went to the options page and filled out return info.  Then I reordered the size I needed.  I was sent a UPS lable to return the small sizes. Recieve credit when they receive the package. Easy process.Packages arrive in a very reasonable amount of time. The shipping is so cheap bc the items are packed very cheaply, always orange bags like the greyish Amazon bags. And any & every item you buy is in its own individual baggie inside this one bag. I've had 30 small items all arrive intact this way.  One or two things like example wreaths crunched,  but flattened or spread out ok after unpacking.You won't get an item list invoice with the shipment, but  they do send a lot of email shipping updates. I would also like to add this thought - so - ok, items are made in communist china?  But how many poor people who need work is this providing jobs for? Think of that. Everyday people like you and I, they live there, and they need jobs. And I live on limited income so I appreciate the prices.It's this an ideal world? No. We should strive to make it better - knowing it will never be eutopia.Should people have to work in factories or in terrible conditions in warehouses? No, but most are thankful to have income & these provide goods. Should we strive to make conditions better? Of course. And where do you think most of the junk we buy at HF, DG, FD, WM, or the tent by the restaurant, or the 'new items' at the flea market, etc etc etc - where do you think all that comes from anyway?",4,07/04/2024
To SU United States. Regarding having to prove copyright on a product. Copyright is automatic and you just have to show you came up with the design before them. Doing it this way as only way to get the info to you. I hate copyright thieves.,1,07/04/2024
You get what you pay for. The quality is not going to be great if it?€?s that cheap. I did a ?€?test?€? shop of some reasonably priced and one very cheap item. And they all came as described. I agree about the packaging- very difficult to get into.,4,07/04/2024
"I put temu UK and thought I was ordering from UK, then I get message say its in flight so obviously gonna of wasted my money as all the Chinese stuff is to small, I'm sure I'll find someone who I be able to give it to",3,07/04/2024
"I will never buy from temu again. I feel like I got ripped off and they won't give me a refund as I can't get the items returned to them. ( they can come and collect it themselves. I thought I was buying good quality standard sized pillows. Instead I received very thin, small baby sized pillows that were out of shape and not comfortable. Wasted $40 on absolute garbage. Do not recommend.",1,07/04/2024
"I am a customer of Temu, I have ordered many items and have been 100% pleased with all of them! Obviously they are not of highest quality but they definitely were worth buying for me. I'm not hired by anyone to give this review, I truly am amazed and love everything I have bought from them!",5,07/04/2024
"We have ordered 3 times, and the experience has been better than local retailers like the Warehouse and Kmart.They always have in stock what you order.Delivery is speedy, especially considering it's coming from overseas.The quality of goods is comparable if not better, than similar products in NZ at half the price. The news media has talked about excessive ads and spam, and games and gambling all things we have not seen at all. I think Retail NZ may be behind the negative news campaign.",5,07/04/2024
The company practices false advertising and does not honor the price advertised and sent to your email even when you shop shortly after receding the email.  Contacting customer service for over an hour of messaging did nothing to address their problem.Their reply below is not relevant.  I tried to purchase immediately after receiving the offer.  I have screenshots.,1,07/04/2024
"I love this company I order may items  from them every week and mine husband using their app as well, quality is very good of every stuff and free return items available too?€? had no problem with refund and got compensation for late delivery too?€? which is never accepted , i m very happy i m using this company for buying mine clothes and other stuff ????????",5,07/04/2024
Goods arrived promptly and were amazingly cheap. Most of what we got as of a fair standard however the 6 pack of razor blades with a razor were all so blunt as to be completely unusable. I binned them all.,3,07/04/2024
"I was a bit dubious about ordering from this site ,mainly because I hadn?€?t heard of them.I gave them a try.and ordered four things .all came within the specified time.all items where of good quality,I had one issue with socks which I had ordered the wrong size.I messaged them and a refund was given straight away and told to keep them.",4,07/04/2024
"I recently spoke with customer service regarding a design that I created and that belongs to me. Unfortunately, they asked for proof in the form of a trademark, patent, or copyright, which I do not have as a small business owner who designs and sells products. Despite I am showing evidence of my products' design files and being sold on my website, they claimed I could not prove ownership of the tote bags with my design. It is frustrating and disappointing that they have not taken action to resolve this issue yet. It is not fair.As an artist, witnessing my tote bag designs being stolen and sold for profit is unacceptable. This is a pervasive problem that harms small businesses everywhere. It is imperative that everyone creates their own unique designs and demonstrate respect for the original artists. This is a matter of justice and ethical behavior.Please, you must avoid buying any products from these counterfeiters and stop endorsing them in any manner.",1,07/04/2024
I love Temu.  Am happy with the  products I have ordered and will continue to order more.  The product range and prices are amazing.  Fast shipping.  It's currently my favorite online go to shop.????????,5,07/04/2024
I ordered a tub of nivea and it never arrived.lm housebound and need it,5,07/04/2024
"I purchased some household items, which were ok, nothing to get excited about and a summer maxi dress?€?absolutely awful. Horrible material, sizes are not as stated.What did I expect in this day and age of companies not giving a toss.Lesson learned, won?€?t be ordering again !",2,07/04/2024
"Whatta scam. Sent me a photo of my ""delivered package"" which was definitely NOT my home. The photo was of a package sitting against a wall in what looks like an apartment building. I'm so disgusted. So now I'm waiting for a refund to my credit card. Do NOT use this company.Update 6/26: Of course they responded with their canned message of what to do, totally missing the fact that I ALREADY DID THAT. If I get my money refunded I'll update this review. But I'm sure I won't be getting my package.",1,07/04/2024
No problems. Does as it says. Great items. Quick delivery,5,07/04/2024
Downloaded the app today seems legit ordered a few things so will update once received.,4,08/04/2024
"Was extremely worried about using temu due to the bad reviews, I ordered a lot products clothes and makeup. We can not fault any of the items, the clothes look exactly how they did on the website, I'm extremely fussy with clothes and I loved every item I ordered. We ordered a shien and temu order at the same time and our shien order is still no where to be found where as our temu was delivered end of last week. Really recommend temu",5,08/04/2024
"I was a bit curious of ordering anything on here because I've been stung that many times but I canHonestly say there's no worries at all...ive spent quite a bit over the past month and no complaints, always well packed and tracked every bit of the way.. but the site is very addictive also if its cheaper on the site in 30 days of ordering you get the difference back..fantastic site and good products no complaints this end",5,08/04/2024
I was skeptical to buy something from here given the price but decided to try Temu as it was the only place selling what I wanted. I was pleased with my order and have ordered a second time. On both occasions the products were exactly as described and shown on the website. The delivery was fast and I had no reason to return anything. I would recommend purchasing from reputable sellers from the page.,5,08/04/2024
"I have had 6 deliveries of mixed items and everyone has arrived on the first day of delivery window. Not had an issue with any items, in fact just placed another order as prices cannot be beaten I believe. Always pay by Paypal.",5,08/04/2024
"Overall?€?I have had a really good experience with them.  You have to look very closely at item description and size guide.  Depending on type of material clothing is made of, I would suggest going a size higher.  I have only had to return a few items and the return process was easy.  I love shopping this company?€?probably a little too much????.",5,08/04/2024
Used Temu several times now & love my items. Clutch bags & T-shirts & socks are super quality and cost a fraction of the price!,5,08/04/2024
Have purchased from Temu on 3 occasions.My purchases include various products from cable ties collapsible funnel to plumbing isolators and so far all have met my expectations.Ordering was very easy and products were at great prices delivery was fast and tracked,5,08/04/2024
"so far I haven't received my merchandise yet, which you had mention out for deliver few days ago , 63 - 27 Cromwell crescent Rego Park NY 11374 ,",2,08/04/2024
Excellent communications from Temu about my order.  Arrived when they said it would.  Good quality iPhone cables.  They said 3 for the price of 2 so I ordered two expecting to get a third.  Beware - maybe I didn't read it properly or clicked on the wrong button - confusing wording perhaps.,5,08/04/2024
got some tint for my car from here arrived in a bag but surprisingly undamaged. thought this is going to be crap stuff was just looking to practice before buying decent stuff but it turned out to be pretty decent ended up using it to tint my windows. arrived in like a week. got a few more things for the kids like a minecraft poster and a few fidget toy things. for ??11 all in im happy,4,08/04/2024
Whatever you do don?€?t provide them card details. These clowns and scam company took 3 payments without ordering anything. Customer service is very sh*** they know how to take payment but when you want refund you have to call you bank. I had to cancel my card to avoid taking them payments,1,08/04/2024
I received all the items on time and in good condition. Some are cheaper than they look but I understand that the price reflects the quality. The main issue for me is the packaging. I hope Temu use more sustainable materials and also prioritize sustainable products. The amount of plastic in their products and packaging is incredible and the reason I won't buy more for them is I feel guilty of consuming so much plastic.,4,08/04/2024
"ordered 4 video cameras for security. Wont stay charged for more than an hour.Only one camera available to view at once. Keep going offline, Wifi was only 2 metres away!App full of stupid adds, What a Joke TEMU!!",1,08/04/2024
"I've made some big purchases (3 big parcels) from Temu but they arrived damaged so I must return them. I shared photos of the damaged parcel to them via chat already. You can imagine I had to find another box to re-package the item, which I asked for compensation for the extra box required but Temu ignored. Then, it took Temu ages to generate the return labels and i later found out that there is weight & size limit when generating labels for bigger items. (It also took weeks for them to find out the reason why they cannot generate return label for me)Secondly, I cannot take these items to Evri parcel shop as they are too big and I'm still in the process of negotiating how I can send these back to Temu. I ordered them on 18 May and it's already 25 June - and this problem is still not yet resolved. This is due to the really slow response from Temu and every time they reply, they seems to forget the entire issue and send me general advice, which seems to copy from a handbook or something which really makes me feel very frustrated and helpless. A company can promise the world but it's only what they actually do matters. I am a very very disappointed customer.",1,08/04/2024
I never had any issues with a Temu order.  Returns are easy and they are quick responding. Thanks ????,5,08/04/2024
"This wig just arrived today and it is awful.  It looks nothing like the pic and it does not have a part and it arrived wet and looks like it had been worn.  I tried to upload the pic for all of you to see but it won't upload.  I tried to right click to copy to show the pic of the wig and that did not work either.Just want you to know this wig is not as it is shown on the website and who gets a wet wig via delivery.  Was this wig worn previously and washed and sent to me.  That would be unethical and unsanitary.This was my first time ordering from this company and this has made me wonder about their products and ethics.__________________________________________________6-26-23This is the only way to respond to Temu's response to me on 6-25-23.  It is not worth me using my gas, time and the inconvenience to take this to be returned.  I wanted the public to be aware you are taking a chance and you may not receive the actual product you see on the website.  I care about consumers not wasting their money.This wig can't be donated or nothing it will be thrown in the trash.  A waste of $12.49.",1,08/04/2024
I had 2 orders delivered recently and I just started using the app.  I am highly satisfied with the products that I got.  I guess it just depends on what you order,5,08/04/2024
Been using for about 6 months now and ordered several time and never had an issue. Some of it is cheap but what do you expect for the price.,5,08/04/2024
"Easy ordering, great discounts, updates by text, everything arrived as ordered and described. Value for money, cheaper than charity shops. Arrived from abroad faster than a lot of UK deliveries, tracking provided. Excellent, can't fault this experience. Thank you temu!",5,08/04/2024
"Seriously love this app. So many bargains and really easy to order from. OK, so you have to wait a bit for delivery,  but it's free!! Customer service is excellent if you have any problems and you get lots of alerts on the status of your order .",5,08/04/2024
"I got hooked on this site months ago and as of right now I?€?m pleased with it. Initially I was hesitant due to there being so many scam sites , so my expectations were low. I surveyed their offerings- which can take hours at least- to find a plethora of items and selections within. I was advised that there are sometimes long waits for delivery, but they will ship expedited for faster receipt. (I?€?ve not found a need for this). I can say with their low prices you get what you pay for and frequently better. What really stands out is the effort they put in to iron out issues that many sellers have in common, namely broken English, bad grammar, inaccurate descriptions,etc. which can lead to frustrating experiences and can turn buyers off. They also keep you updated on shipping with a veritable deluge of tracking info, even if delays are detected. FYI.. I mostly use the site for tools and household items. All in all I will continue to shop with Temu and recommend them.",5,09/04/2024
I was very skeptic when ordering from Temu  so even more suprised when my delivery arrived very quickly and was pleased with all the items i d bought... I will definently buy mire from them...,5,09/04/2024
"I?€?ve been ordering from Temu now for about 2 months and I can?€?t fault them. The items are good quality, there?€?s just so much to choose from. I?€?m ordering all the time and will continue doing so.",5,09/04/2024
Worst company ever!!EVER!!! Purchased items in January and never received. Contacted company and they claimed the resent the items in February.  Again never received. Asked for proof of delivery and they were unable to provide on both deliveries. We are now in June and I still have not received my items or a refund. Emails back and forth on a daily basis.,1,09/04/2024
Have made several orders in less then a month orders arrived on time as stated also all orders send correctly and in working order. So finger crossed for some few more coming this week.,5,09/04/2024

Quite pleasantly surprised. Ordered 3 summer dresses all fit great. Hang well when on. And shipping was amazingly quick. I have to say for the price I paid they are great ???? I will use Temu again,4,09/04/2024
"Absolute scammers! Avoid!! Such a joke they give a discount and when you go to the checkout they are saying oh, sorry the discount is expired after 5 minutes of receiving and charges you the full price!",1,09/04/2024

"Don?€?t waste your time and money ! I thought I give a try  . The parcel arrived on time but nothing was inside from what I?€?ve ordered . I got someone else?€?s parcel with my name and address attached to it . I?€?ve Contact customer services , been ask to upload  pictures of the label and the content in the pack so they can give me a refund which I did  . Later I?€?ve got message that says there is no enough evidence that I have received the wrong pack .  Therefore won?€?t be a refund . What a scam ..:just don?€?t bother",1,09/04/2024
I had ordered several products but they had sent me the wrong items! I ordered hair stuff and they had sent me two brooms for cleaning!? I had sent proof of the items and shipping label and explained my situation however after several days of back and forth with customer service they have decided to not refund me or replace the missing items! They kept asking for proof of the weybill but they never sent one! There was nothing else inside the package except the brooms themselves! Absolutely useless! So now I?€?m paying off Clearpay for something I never received!,1,09/04/2024
"Only took 5 days for delivery even though I was expecting it later than that. Great products, so happy.",5,09/04/2024

Temu is a great site?€? I?€?m happy with everything I?€?ve purchased from them so far ???????????????????? Their prices too is unbeatable.,5,09/04/2024
"I?€?ve made multiple orders containing all up 61 items in total and have had a problem with just 3 items . On each occasion I went through the return/refund process on the App and I was refunded immediately. It was so easy and no return was necessary. Unlike other sale platforms that make you waist time requesting and printing return labels, securely packaging and taking a faulty item to a hubb or post office to send back. Then waiting for them to receive the return before they refund. TEMU gave immediate refund without waisting my time. Some Products are price appropriate quality the same type of quality you expect from Amazon or SHEIN or light in a box. Though I have bought some really nifty things that I never knew I needed and they are great! good quality for a low price. I?€?ll definitely shop with app again.",5,09/04/2024
I was kind of worried about ordering anything because everything seems to be so cheap far as pricing I ordered a couple pairs of sandals and I absolutely love them I would only order a few things at a time as I am trying to still try this place out.,5,09/04/2024
"The first time I was a bit dubious because the prices are quite low, and I thought the package wouldn?€?t arrive on time, or it would have terrible quality items. I was really impressed and I went ahead and ordered multiple items. 2nd order arrived on time as well.Definitely will order again, very happy customer",5,09/04/2024

"The wrong item was sent. It was a smaller version of what was described on the website. I followed all the return instructions and returned the item. Now they are telling me that they never received the item and will not refund my money. However, there is a note on the website that they are not refunding because they did not like my reason. So, how can they not like my reason if they did not received the item. They must have received it even though they are saying that they didn't. This company is not trustworthy.",1,09/04/2024
Has anyone ordered for Temu online shopping?,5,10/04/2024
"This is my sixth order.  In that time, I've had to return things and recieved the credit as soon as the package was dropped off at the post office.  Twice I was told to just keep the item and was credited immediately.  They have never been late delivering and sometimes the package arrived before expected.  The products vary in quality for sure.  It depends on the seller.  I am a very satisfied customer!!",5,10/04/2024
"I heard about this company from a family member & they said it was great, so I thought I would give it a go. Yes, the items are cheap & if you're expecting high quality, cotton, fitted designer clothes you will be disappointed. Having said that, I am more than happy with my clothes. I find if you read the description & the reviews, that helps. I have ordered 3 times now. Each parcel has arrived on time, well packaged & undamaged. I've had 1 delivered by Royal Mail & 2 by Evri. I'm very happy with Temu & will be using them again :-)",5,10/04/2024
"Most products are of poor quality and can actually be purchased much cheaper at a dollar store wich offer better quality. Example, hanging outdoor solar light was not as expected and can be bought elsewhere for half the price.Next time I will research the products better. Gave another 2 stars for customer service. Reply to Temu response. Thank you for good customer service and standing by your products. I did initiate a return and waiting for the refund.",4,10/04/2024

Temu is a good company yes you can wait up to 10 days to get the stuff you order but it's the customs on this side that slows it down everything I've ordered has been good exactly what they say I would highly recommend this company,5,10/04/2024
"I ordered 48 items over 5 orders.  The first two were cancelled in the space of a day and an immediate refund was received.  The following 3 orders, seemed fine and seemed to be proceeding.  Then just as quickly cancelled and refunds received.  WHY? And I can't seem to get a reason.  Then they have the audacity to (automatic or not) continue to encourage me to use the $32 in $5 ""commiseration funds"" by purchasing.  But what is the point when I can't get my orders? :-(.   Round and round in circles......  27 June 2023:  Several days after the above review:  I have now had 6 orders cancelled!  This latest also read ""shipping restrictions"". The reply from my review above read: ""sorry, (and all that), please contact us.  Exactly what I have been doing!"".  Will see if my other 2 orders (of 8 I have done in total) come and if not I am cancelling Temu as a right-off.",1,10/04/2024
"I have ordered things 5 times from Temu..I was a bit,naturally concerned at first..but I have to say I am very impressed with the punctuality and quality of the items...and the prices are amazing..Never had a problem ????",5,10/04/2024
I see they reply to the satisfied customers..So I come to this page to read reviews before I shop with this company..I've been reading on and off just to see if it gets better or worse.. And I've noticed like I've said in the beginning they only reply to happy customers..,2,10/04/2024
"Their customer service is awful and still waiting on a package being sent to me via Evri, that they couldn't be less bothered about. I will never use this company again!",1,10/04/2024
"Never received my refund, I returned the parcel as all was wrongly sized, and now two weeks later I'm still awaiting my refund, I have now had to place it in the hands of PayPal.Customer service not very helpful either and very strange how the comment on positive feedback but not on the negative ones",1,10/04/2024
This is my first time ordering receiving first order like the merchandise but opening the package the petroleum smell was so bad made me sick as I have environmental sensitivity and I got immediately sick! My Sister washed clothing and smell went away but two items shoes and waistbelt no luck so I will just have to throw away. Second large package leary to open but no petroleum smell and liked all items except 3 items way to big even though paid attention to sizing 2 were some real nice flip flop shoes and other nice jumper not sure will bother sending back as not sure if that process would be hard. Not saying I have tried just think it might. I will donate to charity instead really want flip flop shoes so will think about reordering. I have a third package coming and hope that it will be like the second with no petroleum smell. In all the items I order all were good and for most part I liked everything.,4,10/04/2024
"Absolutely  dodgy products Cheaply madeAnything electric  does not have Australian  plugsNo return ...just a temu credit, once they have your  cash they keep itItems arrive looking nothing like the advertised  item.Parcels are just left on doorsteps  all day for anyone to steal, no signature  required,  then when you complain about it, they tell you to take it up with Australia post and accept  no responsibility  whatsoever,  regardless of what their policy  says",1,10/04/2024

Please do something about your search process I was looking for kids trainers ( I typed ?€? kids trainers?€? in the search bar and what came up was appalling I was utterly shocked?€?..my young daughters love buying from Temu but with these kind of images popping up Im not sure I want her too use this app anymore. On a better note Everything we have brought up to now has been good and very quick delivery.  EDIT .. it seems so have been sorted now,5,10/04/2024

"I ordered on the 8th of June, they said I should receive my parcel between 18th-22 June , in between this time, nothing updated on the Evri website. Today is the 22nd of June and I received an email saying they have refunded my order due to the delivery was failed to come.Fair point that I should expect my refund soon,  but why advertise If you guys (Temu) are loosing money in general? Make it make sense?",1,10/04/2024

"Excellent order . I ordered 2 tops and 3 dresses from Temu. Delivery was via EVRI once in the UK, I found it to be much quicker than SHEIN , and materials felt less plasticy. Would recommend",5,10/04/2024

"I started ordering on TEMU in March. I've ordered 100s of products, clothes, shoes, jewelry, decor, makeup, rugs, curtains etc. They have never once missed a product in my orders. Yes shipping takes a little longer but the money you save is worth it. For example, I bought a very colorful rug, 20 bucks on Temu, same rug on Amazon was 78 bucks. Got it in 8 days. Any problem you have, customer service will do their best to make it right.",5,11/04/2024

1st order came fast and love all the items. 2nd order on the way with the third following closely. If you plan ahead Christmas is gonna be very cheap and fun! Got eveyone at work to download the app and everyone?€?s currently feeding fish ???? Just call it team building,5,11/04/2024
"I don't order from TEMU regularly despite constant ads appearing.  I assume the prices reflect poor quality. So I ordered 10 tee shirts with July 4th designs and was surprised that they arrived on time and quality is fine.  Not the greatest, but good enough for holiday wear.",5,11/04/2024
"Unfortunately never got the chance to try their products as they were using EVRI as a courier which has lost my 2 parcels with 15 items ordered, the delivery person just left it in an unsafe place and my parcel got lost. Contacted Evri with no response. Applied for a refund through Temu and still awaiting for it to be processed.",2,11/04/2024
"I don't normally leave reviews, but I have got to say I cannot fault this site, originally thought it was a cheap s**t shop with stuff that falls to bits. I was surprised how good the quality is in clothing. Decent quality fabric, great stitching and cut and sizes spot on. Delivery on time, packaged really well. I don't know about return policy because I don't want to return anything. Free del on orders over ten quid and now on my 4th order struggling to spend a tenner. Happy lady Devon",5,11/04/2024
"I am surprised, relieved, and delighted, today?€? having seen bad reviews after being tempted to order?€? everything I wished for , & so cheap, has arrived spot on time, neatly packaged, with tracking info all the way. Maybe I was lucky?  But very pleased,  not scammed, and glad to add this review!",5,11/04/2024
Second review! First a little harsh maybe as I?€?ve just received my second order 3 days early and everything is good! Customer service is fantastic also! Excellent! (Deleted my first review based on this second experience! GO TEMU ????,5,11/04/2024
Pleasantly surprised. Really quality goods at low prices. Didn?€?t take that long to arrive. Will be ordering stuff again!,5,11/04/2024
I returned a parcel via Evri on 22nd May 2023 however a month later I have had no updates and no refund.I have emailed them and first they told me i need a ?€?local?€? order number - i?€?m from the UK so no idea what they mean by local.I am now still emailing back and forth. It is so much effort for something that should be seamless. Shein returns are MUCH smoother.I do not reccommended Temu as so far i have lost money,1,11/04/2024
"Great value. But honestly customer service is the worst. Had several parcels delivered over the weekend when I was away and left on doorstep. Appreciate this is not Temu fault but it is their responsibility to chase courier and honour refund for goods not received. 3 days so far trying to sort it and all I keep getting is to check with neighbours and contact delivery company. Have done that, they were left on doorstep for 4 days and clearly stolen yet nobody taking responsibility. Cannot get to talk to a human either!!!!",1,11/04/2024
"I have received 6 orders from Temu, all arrived within 12 days. I am 95% satisfied with the numerous products received, ranging from jewelry findings to a dog training collar to clothing and fishing lures. About to place my 7th order!",5,11/04/2024
It's a scam. They will take your money and give you the run around with customer service. Making you chase your tail and wasting your time.,1,11/04/2024
"So Temu is actually quite good so far. Giving me tracking details, quite accurate, and easy to understand. Ive just ordered my on 16th, and ordered another parcel today. Still waiting... but hoping it will be a smooth experience. I spent over ??40 on this order, and Evri seems to be a grumpy delivery experience as i have had a parcel from there before. So, im expecting a great parcel to be delivered to my door. Excited! Just a little note, EVRi is an extremely rushed delivery and the deliverer is always grumpy and rushes back to the van as soon as delivered, making my other parcel from EVRi delayed for 4 hours as it turns out it was in the alley way. edit: recieved ONE DAY EARLY! I'm surprised, the delivery worker was much more cheerful and agreed to pass through window. Much love for TEMU! Just ordered another one 5 days ago, recieved 2 DAYS EARLY! Incredible.",5,11/04/2024
"Ordered online some garden ornaments for my late Mum's headstone plus a couple other gifts. Efficient and swift delivery, all well packed. Excellent service for reasonable prices.",5,11/04/2024
"Most of the clothes I've ordered from TEMU are junk. The materials have been scratchy, like wax paper, cheap looking.  One item that I am keeping will not lose the fold lines that it arrived with, even after I have washed the item. Another item is supposed to have 'fluttery sleeves'  which is what makes the top attractive, but the sleeves are 1/2 the size of the photo. Very disappointed. However I did order a purse from TEMU that I really love. The clothes depicted are very cute but the material is not comfortable at all. The clothes remind me of Forever 21, very cheap and wear for a couple of months and throw away.  That's not how I want to spend my money.  I am returning 3 tops, and I am not hopeful I will see my refund. I have to return the items in the same bag they came in, and find a box even though the items were not shipped to me in a box.  I'd be better off donating the clothes to the local non profit.",2,11/04/2024
Brilliant order had 19 items amazing price- all clothing items fit me and I was very impressed with how quick the delivery time was too! Will be shopping for clothes moving forward now on Temu! ??????,5,11/04/2024
"I've now placed two orders with Temu and have not been disappointed. First order gave me 6 items free out of 10 so was expecting second order to be less efficient. However, second order did not disappoint either and came well packed. I have only purchased cheap tools and electrical connectors from this company so cannot speak to quality of any other items. Tools and connectors are of decent quality and a fraction of the price of same items on Amazon. Only two concerns, which deducts 1 star from the review - firstly, I am now constantly bombarded by phone notifications from Temu and secondly, they use Evri/Hermes for deliveries (so it's only a matter of time before a package goes missing)! Been lucky so far with two out of two parcels arriving safely, which is surprising for Evri/Hermes!",4,11/04/2024
"I ordered a few items and didn't expect TEMU to be of great quality because it's so cheap. However, I was so surprised when all the items arrived on time and they are of a good quality. I will definitely be ordering from Temu again.",5,12/04/2024
Rubbish customer service every time you need to ask for for the credit of ??5 as all the time agent created ticket nobody can offer you the right information Delayed and bad service,1,12/04/2024
"My first purchase from Temu, and everything has been very frustrating. My package was lost for several days, and when they finally found it, thanks to the USPS, because Temu had their hands full, most of the items I had ordered were missing. From there, everything has been an odyssey, at first they offered me compensation for part of the problem, but I did not receive it; I wanted a complete solution; one of the agents offered to give me a refund and asked me to request it, to my surprise now they denied it, saying that everything was fine. Is this a mockery with your customer? I have photos and archived all the conversations with their agents. This is outrageous, and I will not rest easy until they resolve my case.They are wiping their hands of their responsibility and ignoring their supposed buyer protection policies. This is all very frustrating and time-consuming, and I would not want anyone else to go through the same thing; at least my purchase is not much, but beware for those who make significant purchases here.UPDATE 23-06: After speaking with several agents via online chat and following the steps that they responded here to, I did, and they have refused to refund my money because, according to them, they have ""policies"" that say my package arrived and is not incomplete. Even though I have photos, security camera videos, USPS emails, and more, what do you think this is?Through a ticket I have open, the agent does nothing but reply to me with automated responses; they don't care that I didn't receive my items and that I am losing money. As I have told them, they want to make a fool of me through every possible means. They have not even looked for a way to give me an average solution. This has been the worst online shopping experience I have ever had. I am out of my items and money, but I'll keep going until I find a solution.",1,12/04/2024
Great communication just check sizes but no problems with them,4,12/04/2024
"I have received 3 orders, all were fast delivery and generally as advertised.  With this I have no problems and a 4 star......BUT!  .......I am sick to death of constant notifications, EVEN THOUGH I have turned them off.This is very, very, annoying, and I wonder if this is a tactic (to deliberately ignore the no notifications).",4,12/04/2024
"No problems with them, u pay for what u get a little like wish but better, fairly fast delivery   I always pay via clear pay and hand no problems apart fron the odd thing breaks. Over all I will continue to use them",4,12/04/2024
"This is the 3rd time I have shopped temu. Very good tracking, quality is decent, prices are incredibly cheap. Just be sure you carefully read the description. Some things are really small.",5,12/04/2024
"I could have made the mistake trusting the bad reviews. But I'm glad I listened to the good ones. The product I ordered arrived to me in NZ within a week. I used to use ebay and Ali express a lot, but Temu has a lot of the same stuff and can be even cheaper in many cases. I will be using Temu many more times going forward.",5,12/04/2024

Such fantastic products ???? Great value for money,5,12/04/2024
"I wasn't expecting much but have been surprised. I've ordered twice from Temu in a matter of weeks. It's great for stationary, make up storage, water bottles and birthday accessories, it's not so great for clothes, but that's fine. I wouldn't expect much for the price for the one top and one dress I bought, but that's ok, it works for the beach over the summer. Delivery is within the week, which is great. I don't like the delivery company Evri, the drivers are always grumpy and somehow the package always arrives looking like someone kicked it, but I've been happy with both my purchases. I will admit, I had to turn the notifications off, it was like a really irritating Tamagotchi, just won't stop notifying you about some prize, or spin the wheel coupon to your phone and text.",4,12/04/2024
"You have little respect for your customer when you fail to contact your shipping agents EVRi in the UK. From what I have experienced EVRi is a poor low level shipping courier, their customer service point of contact is non existent for Temu delivery enquiries. I would suggest you find a different shipping courier in the UK. Until then I won't be purchasing from Temu until you do.",1,12/04/2024
When first time I saw the add about my baby girl products I m very excited to saw all things because it's too reasonable but as usual I m afraid may be it's fraud or may be scam but I tried and I m shocked to see all products then 6 times I ordered different things and now this app becomes my most favorite for online shopping..good work keep it up guys ..,5,12/04/2024

"A great choice of items, deluvery was quick and swift.. would definitely recommend using Temu",5,12/04/2024
"I got what I ordered, and it was quick. It looked like the package was put through some kind of threshing machine, but it arrived on time. I had ordered clothing, and I found the quality to be extremely poor. I sent most of it back. All of it felt like plastic. I ordered t-shirts and they just felt like they'd make you sweat instantly. I won't order from Temu again. Grateful that the return process is easy, although refunds take a while according to their app. They will give you a credit pretty much right away, but I'm not interested in purchasing anything again.",2,12/04/2024
Brilliant company everything I order delivered on time Temu always keeps me updated on myOrders great company would recommend it to all my friends and family,5,12/04/2024
You get what you pay for I've purchased  25 items over 5 orders 4 items were broken due to packing or did not work at all (Dash cam)  the 21 items are reasonable for the price if you want top quality stuff this sit is not for you but you can find some good value stuff having said that some items were cheaper on UK sites,4,12/04/2024
"Highly delighted with my purchase , what would have cost me ??40 in the uk I got for ??5 including delivery , I was informed of item progress from order to delivery. I have no complaints at all . And yes the quality is superb .",5,12/04/2024
"OK, we have placed about 6 orders (so far). EVERY order arrived on time and complete. They DO ship things in bags! I ordered a Dash camera, works perfectly, tools (work fine) Electronic parts... no knock offs, the real deal and all perfect. Ordered bathmats, good quality. Ordered some plastic plant watering things..junk...OK lost $2.00. Also ordered SD cards, work great, some Corgi Dog accessories, no problems.So far ZERO problems, things arrive on time. ONE bag was a day late and they kicked back $5. We DO NOT use the ""App"", just a browser and pay thru Paypal. No problems. If I had to complain about anything, it's the constant (annoying) daily...sometimes multiple daily email specials. Hard sell, timed ""Sales""..buy it NOW or your going to lose out. We simply ignore those and buy when we feel like it.OK... honestly...were NOT usually impressed with the Chinese vendors, but to be very honest, this company is a LOT less hassle than the 3rd party vendors on Amazon! As long as the orders go thru, the doorbell rings (on time) and the items do their purpose..were going to continue to buy from Temu.",4,12/04/2024
"waited 3 weeks for customer service to fix a game, nothing happened and they kept sending the same old copied and pasted message.",1,12/04/2024
I was a first time TEMU buyer. I did not know what to expect. I was pleased with my order. All items  were of good quality. I placed a second order recently and its now on its way. Being selective and knowing the market of wholesale buying makes this site unique.,5,12/04/2024
Funny how these clowns only ever answer people that give five stars instead of fixing peoples problems.  I am not stupid enough to buy from these scammers - just an observation,5,12/04/2024
Lightening delivery.Bought 3 dresses. Was pleasantly surprised as was expecting total rubbish. They aren't bad. Will certainly do for my holiday as 3 loose cool dresses. The only criticism is the fabric is very thin so they are translucent. I would definitely buy again. Perfect for 3 beach dresses.,4,12/04/2024

They are totally worthless items that I have ever seen . Their quality are far away from photo that they showed on website. There are alot fake reviews on its site. I am totally disappointed its scam business .Although delivery process is really promising, I wouldn?€?t buy again any items from Temu and their company shares.",1,12/04/2024

I have now used Temu 4 times and the items have all arrived for the first 2 and only 1 item was not as expected which I requested a return and the credit was given the very next day. Both orders received were before the due date and I received messages all along the delivery process so, so far, I have not had any problems and have recommended the site to 4 of my friends and they have so far received their goods in order too. Well done to customer services and the orders team.",4,13/04/2024

"horribly useless customer service. They claim that they delivered a product to my home, I never received the product, I called them, no body picked up the phone, then i used the chat box, I got a response 1 day later. They keep on claiming that the product was delivered. I keep on writing to them that the product was never received. This happened twice and Now I have vowed to never buy a product from their website.",1,13/04/2024

"Firstly the TEMU reviews previously from me have been very good. That`s because there were no problems. However don`t refer to a live  `chat online ` when you don`t appear to have one. All TEMU seem to have is message board that doesn`t respond to any question from my several attempts. In frustration I looked for an email address for which there isn`t one. My problem was that I bought a cheap dash cam, which when wired up seemed to work fine. However having tried to program it, with the one multi button control ,I found it had a mind of its own and wouldn`t respond correctly. In fact it was useless. Hence I wanted to return it as it was not fit for purpose. All fine - go into TEMU request a return and label printed ,then  I noticed it says RETURN IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING of which I had disposed. I justed wanted to confirm it was in order to return the faulty product but just couldn`t get anyone to acknowledge my question.`    No response. In the meantime I have purchased another more expensive Dash Cam from TEMU and await delivery. I`m returning the original faulty product and expect a refund under the sale of goods act for consumer rights",1,13/04/2024
"Awful quality. Everything totally cheap tat. Slow postage - my advice do not buy, if it?€?s 90% off there is a reason-it cost about 2p to make. As my Dad says ?€?if it?€?s too good to be true. . .?€?",1,13/04/2024
I was dubious at first but was told by friends that they have used Temu before. Have been very happy with my purchases so far keep up the good work. The deliveries came early before due date,5,13/04/2024
I was very skeptical about this company due to how low the prices were but I went ahead and ordered a load of baby stuff and loved every single thing! Such good quality especially for the price and delivery was quick! Just made another order! Would definitely recommend!,5,13/04/2024
I have ordered a dress for almost 2months now I have not yet received. Tried to email about it and they reply back giving an excuse of Covid. Now I am forced get the refund back. Please do not buy from this site. It?€?s a big scam.,1,13/04/2024
Cheap website and great price no problems with delivery and I love this sight,5,13/04/2024
Ordered items saying delivery day from 16th-18th but still ain?€?t got anything emailed help line at Temu they keep saying track your order which iv done but keeps saying in transit it?€?s not happy with the delivery service plus not sure if il ever get my paid items can?€?t get a decent replay from Temu,1,13/04/2024
I ordered some dresses and am really pleased with the quality and price. They look exactly like the picture and the size guidance is very accurate. I would definitely order clothes from them again,5,13/04/2024
"Bought a matching pair of Men's cargo shorts. The zippers are very poor quality. Have to keep lubing them just so they can even work. They keep grabbing, jambing, work very hard both up and down, and lock up at the bottom. I now have to make sure I always have safety pins in my pockets. The zippers are of very poor quality and will never work smoothly like the zippers we are accustomed to. No sense contacting Temu. They can't fix junk! The shorts were at a very low price. Now I can see why.",2,13/04/2024
Everything I ordered came within the specfied time. When buying. Look at the dimensions. Items look larger than they are..Jewelry mostly Some items were broke or chipped but I was refunded.Thus far I'd buy again,4,13/04/2024
Please don?€?t buy products from Temu it?€?s a rip off. I ordered many items and items are not the same as shown in pictures. Most of the items don?€?t work. It?€?s cheap but not worth . Customer service are more worst .,1,13/04/2024
"This is my 3rd transaction with Temu.Overall one thing I observed, if you pay little more the quality of products are good. If you go low price the quality is also very low.Another important thing if you don?€?t like you can return and get refund as Credit in Temu account which is instant and otherwise PayPal/account take mostly 2 weeks.But happy to trade.",5,13/04/2024
"I returned items and they were received on 24th May. As I paid through Klarna and gave them details of the refurn, Temu are refusing to refund me.  They wont reply to emails and there is no live chat function. Avoid at all costs++I received the reply below from them.  I did contact customer service and everything stays the same. Unless I cancel the return with Klarna, I will not get my refund.  The 1st advisor I was on chat to told me to ""sit back, relax, smile and drink some water"".  An absolute joke of a company",1,14/04/2024
I never received my package worth $161.31. I reached out to customer service multiple times and was dealing with the customer service for over an hour each time. I never received refund or reshipment of package. Do not use TEMU.  Unreliable. Extremely disappointed with my experience.,1,14/04/2024
"I have had very good experience with temu. They sent their products promptly but the delivering company (Evri) failed to deliver the parcel- I had a delivery notice that the parcel was delivered to me but never received it and Evri never followed this up. When I told Temu, they immediately re shipped all items and even gave me a ??5 voucher although it was not their fault at all that the parcel went missing.",5,14/04/2024
I am very pleasantly surprised. I would recommend. Ordered 3X now,5,14/04/2024
I would just like to ask about returning items if you don't own a printer? Can you send a returns label with the package?,5,14/04/2024
"My ??57 order failed delivery (Temu blaming Evri). No way to get my money back, only credited to my Temu account. I tried to order same items again, but price is much higher now. Stay away from this site.",1,15/04/2024
"So far I've got 5 orders from this website.The minus points are that sometimes they use Yodel as a delivery company and I had some problems with them, but everything was sorted out at the end. The sizes are a bit confusing on the website and I had ordered wrong sizes for me. But everything that don't have size is coming as it is shown on the website. Positive points are: Fast Delivery, Return address is in the UK and the return and refunds are dealt very quickly. I had 3 returns and everything went smooth and fast.  I have contacted 2 times the customer support on the chat and after passing the chat bot everything was brilliant. I am really happy with some of the prices and offers, other items are just okay. I recommend this website as my whole experience is good.",5,15/04/2024
"I've only bought from them twice, everything arrived on time, and what I ordered..no problems at all..Anyone who pays with PayPal, is covered should anything happen to go wrong..",5,15/04/2024
"I have now ordered 3 lots of items from Temu.the first order got returned to sender, although i waited in a 400+ chat queue, I did manage to chat with someone and got a full refund was told it would take 5 days got it straight away (PayPal).2nd and 3rd orders where exactly what was ordered and was received within the stated time so far so good, 4th order went in yesterday",5,15/04/2024
"Worse customer service ever. I?€?ve invited 3 new app users and I didn?€?t get any reward . I asked an agent . The agent is replying to 10 other ppl probably with the same concern, if I was to call would you be talking to other ppl whiles your on call with me. This is a misleading site. I?€?ll not buy from Temu and I?€?ll spread the word too!!",1,15/04/2024
"1- can't leave a review on Play Store ???? I tried for several days.2- do not get fooled by the ""opening"" prices: EVEN the ""new app users"" (as stated on their ads) won't get these prices UNLESS they go through the painstaking referral game Temu built its business upon! In order to get your gifts/lower prices/in-store credit, you must invite ALWAYS MORE people, who must install the app and sign up WITHIN 24H, or else, it doesn't count. (It kept on saying ""Yay! You're just 1 invite away from your free gift!"", even though the people I invited had just signed up and were supposed to be the ""1 invite away"".....)3- use ONLY IF you're ok with paying their regular prices: they still have good deals, but you might also find less expensive or within a $3-5 difference on Amazon, Walmart eBay, etc... Just compare prices.4- I'd say, stay away from electronics and delicate items, as they ship all their products in envelopes... with no paddling.",2,15/04/2024

"I ordered with hesitation per reviews, I waited a week and a half and I received my order and all things were better quality than expected.  There are so many sites out there and they usually have sub standard items that loosely resemble the photo on their website.  I see that Temu is owned by a company out if Boston with headquarters in China. And have seen info that we should be careful with the app. Many items and companies we shop  at are owned in whole or part by investors in China.  I have not had any issues at all.  Pay attention to the settings they ask u to allow. And listen to your gut.  For me, it is seeming to be a good option for some things I utilize.",5,15/04/2024

did not received parcel but they have soon put it right and received a full refund will buy again,4,15/04/2024
"So what everyone is saying is that ?€?oh the progress bar for free stuff is always going so slowly so you?€?ll never get free stuff?€? that?€?s not true, my stuff arrived yesterday and I?€?m very happy. They obviously can?€?t give a bunch of free stuff unless you make 5-10 people download the app. This is a 10/10 for me",5,15/04/2024
"I have bough  a watch Temu promoted as military standard. The watch is both digital and analogue. However, the analogue part of the watch I received doesn?€?t work.So, I recommend TEMU to double check items are in good conditions before sending them out to customers.",3,15/04/2024
"Temu has surprisingly impressed me in many ways. I was scammed by another company on TT and was very weary about trying another online place.My first order came on time and I was truly happy with what I got. The pet toys are adorable and smaller than I expected but my kitty loves them all. There are some issues that I will address in my reviews. Overall, I highly recommend Temu and I really look forward to reviewing more products as I receive them.",5,15/04/2024
"Free shipping, free return in 90 days, if you don?€?t like the product they give you the refund and sometimes no need to return. It?€?s worry free shopping and most products are pretty good quality specially for the price!",5,15/04/2024
"I've had 3 deliveries from this and it's been great and very quick, took less than 2 weeks, everything I bought was exactly as I hoped. I don't try and get the free stuff that looks to much hassle but this company is very much legit. Its saved me a fortune and It has things I have never seen before for pennies really, BBQs around ??20, thier basic but it's still a bbq. I like buying off here when I don't have much money. Very happy, will definitely be using in the future.",5,15/04/2024
"Second order and so far so good, more to come and if this keeps up will be ordering more. (Package was damaged but all items were intact, not Temu's fault).",5,15/04/2024
"I placed an order for the first time and got exactly what I ordered, The only thing I do not like about the site is that I never got coupons for money off, even when I referred people, Improvements that could be made are definitely too reward people with actual coupons like shein do.There are lots of products I like on this site however.",5,15/04/2024
The only complaint I have is my sun glasses were broken when I got them the box they came in was mashed Thanks Cathey Wood,4,15/04/2024
Surprisingly good! Ordered multiple items a week ago and everything arrived in one package and on time. Some of the prices are incredible but I?€?m a little dubious about whether a couple of the things I bought are the real deal. Nevertheless I?€?d happily buy again.,4,16/04/2024
"Very sceptical on my first order but extremely happy with the 4 dresses i ordered. Delivered in 8 days too. I cant believe how good they are. A lady of a certain size (small) and bulky in parts so to speak, the 'A' line dresses are absolutely perfect. I will definately be making more purchases now!.  Thank you Temu, you've saved my summer????",5,16/04/2024
Quality of the products that I recived is really poor. Very cheep stuff that don't last for long. Not recommend. Pictures are misleading by presenting good quality products in fact most of the products are cheaply made and low quality.,1,16/04/2024
I would never order again from this company. I ordered two under seat cabin bags. What I received was a small package with a silk type scarf with horses on. I emailed them but no reply. Email several times but they just bounced back. I paid ??35 for my order & received a scarf worth 50p. They cheated me out of my hard earned money.,1,16/04/2024

"NEVER been so over spammed in my life.   Texts, pop ups, emails, coupons, deals, specials...SO OVERKILL.   Way too many sellers for the same items... page by page by page same product at different prices with different ratings TEMU!  After 2.5 hours I selected 2 main electronic items and then filled up with cheap stuff to make $50 coupon order.   Order came FAST and was 100% complete, but BOTH electronic items didn't function at all.   Do not buy electronics from them as they use horrible apps, have poor instructions, and they don't work.   The security camera light bulb items only spoke in Chinese...so couldn't trouble shoot why it wouldn't connect.   This site will take up hours of your time.  On the good side it was very easy to deal with the 2 defective items.Now a month later... there isn't any website I can go on using google chome without a TEMU add showing... I have given add feedback 3 or 4 times saying it have seen it too many time and that it doesn't apply to me and still they keep coming... TEMU will follow you for the rest of your life once you buy from them>",2,16/04/2024
SCAM! Do not order from them. Got an incomplete order. Several items are missing. No order summary paper no return labels included. Impossible to contact customer service. My order number: 0082800082808640740948,1,16/04/2024
Everything I ordered was great for the money,5,16/04/2024
"I was hesitant at first so initial order was not too expensive. Was delightfully impressed with value, quality and delivery. Made a far more expensive follow up order and was again impressed. However, the subsequent 2 orders (again fairly expensive) have stalled. Apparently having difficulty sourcing some items!. They should not advertise availability of items if they are not in stock. Customer service is via a ?€?live chat?€? with a bot, very poor and no customer service email. I have ?€?urged orders?€? and have received a ??5 credit. The latter 2 orders were mainly for items I wanted for an upcoming holiday and the initial delivery date was to be in sufficient time. I now seriously doubt they will arrive in time which has left me very disappointed. I do find it suspicious that once they have your confidence and you spend more they can then mess you about. One problem order may be I could accept but 2 arouses my suspicion significantly.Better customer services contact other than a bot is required. Also I believe rather than a ??5 credit for delayed orders they should adopt a rapid delivery service when orders are significantly delayed.Fortunately I used PayPal so will begin claim back if delivery is delayed further.Be aware they clearly advertise stock as available and urge early purchase, however it is obvious not all stock is actually readily available.",3,16/04/2024
"I've called customer service several times, have received orders much sooner than expected and always got through within a few minutes yet there was an issue on June 14, 2023. I was told it would be escalated to a different department. They now will NOT take a call from my number.I called this evening in hopes to get help regarding the two automated emails we received on June 14, 2023. I was on hold for well over an hour, called from a friend's cell phone, got through to an agent within about two minutes. I believe they have placed my number on a list which will allow me to get through yet be placed on a continuous looped recording.They should have the decency to honor their policy, answer their phone, help customers, etc. The fact I got through within a couple of minutes using a different number speaks volumes. I am sure we are not the only paying customers they are treating in this way. Very bad way to run a business. They need to do the right thing, fix my issue as well as that of others. If this gets resolved, I will do an update on the review.",1,16/04/2024
Ordered a couple of kitchen gadgets that cost peanuts and all great. Had to return two tracksuits (nothing wrong with them). Sent at 3pm yesterday and the money was back in my account immediately. Goods have no way of reaching their destination yet. Certainly won't waste my time on other sites.Temu you have blown me away. 5 stars,5,16/04/2024
"I have made several purchases over several months. The most recent interaction was today.I had one shipment be delivered elsewhere. Temu instantly reshipped, no questions asked. The agents are all so kind, helpful, and knowledge. 80% of the products ordered for men, women, and children have all been high quality for a fair market price. Just cannot thank them enough for the hours of joy they are able to bring my children with engaging, family friendly toys. I enjoy many of their health/beauty products and clothes, and my husband enjoys many of their sturdy tools. Just fantastic, thank you Temu!",5,16/04/2024
Great prices and I?€?m really happy with the products. The delivery was on time and the notifications were really efficient. I?€?ll be using this site a lot as why pay more when you can get these bargains. I?€?ve saved a fortune. Thanks Temu,5,16/04/2024
"I ordered some stuff there since some weeks and beside of the usual advertising flaws like offering 100 pcs of cable ties for 50c you click on there and suddenly it's only 10 ties for 50c and 100 for $4.97 etc. there are some bargains lurking there in the middle. Also be careful regarding the typical Asian scams like selling fake products or not as described. But in my case at least Temu stepped in and refunded the money without dragging their feet. Some products I bought there even for up to about 40 dollars in value turned out to be a really good deal, all discounts counted in. They do also quick shipping within 2 weeks. So just be careful what you buy there, because every letter and picture counts! If you see 12 items in the pic and the text only says 1 item, well then you'll only get one item, not a dime a dozen. And if the text doesn't mention the number, then assume you get only one either. I was reading here a comment regarding a dollar store experience and I think that is a great way to describe the shopping experience. Particularly if you buy more expensive items than a few bucks, read and watch everything. Also make sure you scroll to the bottome of the reviews, because the worst reviews there are on the bottom, not the top!",5,16/04/2024
"Ordered lots of items and they were delivered on time. All electrical stuff wouldn?€?t work in uk. So tried to return them.  All seemed okay except the return label was not recognised by Yodel.

If Temu responds, I need to return 6 items via Evri as Yodel does not accept returns. Send a return label that works or refund my money without returning items as they are useless anyway. John Patel",1,16/04/2024
This place can replace your dollar shop purchase. But that's it. Don't expect that you can save a lot of money buying authentic stuffs in there because all those brand name ones are fake. They also sell your phone number to some illegal groups so I keep having spam calls from China custom.,2,16/04/2024
"Lesson learnt DO NOT SHOP HERE Shocking customer service and customer experience.Done 2 orders and had returns on both orders. 1st order was ??32 refund - 2nd order was ??11 refund, sent back 1 week apart.Received refund for 2nd return after 3 days for ??11 but having to fight for my ??32 refund because I have told Klarna I have returned items ?????€???€???Funny how Temu can refund the lower item (which was the same process on Klarna) but not the higher amount.Speaking to someone on live chat is like pulling teeth and the ticket which is open is a joke as no one responds.Temu want me to close the claim with Klarna so they can refund but I am not doing this as I don?€?t have the support from Klarna if I do this and I do not trust Temu to refund the moneySurprise surprise - leave a negative review and receive your refund the next day",1,16/04/2024

I placed my order on 8th June and received it today on 15th June in a week considering how it comes all the way from china their shipping was really fast and they have a really great customer service they keep on emailing and sending updates about whereabouts of my packages through phone messages or emails and even in the app which is really reassuring everything about it is great but before buying items you need to check the reviews and place your reviews too so that it would be helpful to others i am really happy with this and will be buying from them more soon,4,16/04/2024

"Having no heard of Temu I only ordered ??10.00 worth for a test. Fridge drink despenser, lasted about a hour before leaking, T-Shirt advertised as XL was more like a medium, shower storage shelf not used yet but looks ok. Summary: I was expecting very poor products but usable products, T-Shirt maybe if I lost some weight, Fridge despenser went straight into the recycle bin. Never again for me.",2,17/04/2024
"You may try it on your own risk, half of the products are cheap quality and may not work. And the worst would be if you wish to return.

"Everything from start to finish was fantastic.  Placing the order was simple,  and I loved how I was kept informed by text each step of the way.

"I?€?m trying to return a cheap and nasty rug that I bought and I need a QR code so that EVRI can print the label. I spent 2 hours on a chat with someone on Saturday who passed it to another team to reply via email.

They?€?re hoping that people won?€?t bother.I?€?ve never known a company not to provide a QR code for stores to scan and print the labels for them.This company are scamming pieces of trash. It?€?s obvious why everything is so cheap, all of my items look like they?€?ll fall apart within the week.Do not ever buy anything from this trash company.EDIT: The reply to this review just ironically proves the point in my review.

I have now ordered twice from them and I have been very pleased.  Everything is great quality.  I will continue ordering from TEMU.  I have not had any problems with my orders.  I have received my orders within two weeks or less.  The products are true to size and color.  I can't wait to try everything but I have ordered so much that it will take me some time to use everything at least once lol.  Thank you TEMU for such wonderful products and for having  great prices.  You have won me as a customer!,5,17/04/2024
"I use to love this app! I?€?d spend hours on it playing games and shopping. I?€?ve actually won a few games BUT you have to spend money to win. And sometimes you have to spend a LOT! It?€?s BS! I finally realized that it wasn?€?t worth it. And some of the games are a complete joke! You literally have to get people to download the app in order to win. And sometimes they want a handful of people!!! I don?€?t have anyone else to refer! How many people do they think I know??? That?€?s all the games are about is spending money and referrals. I caught onto that pretty quickly! And THEN?€?. I did a dispute with another company through PayPal. Well somehow Temu and a couple other companies I used PayPal to checkout with that week, also got added. But that was a total mistake! So I got ahold of PayPal and had them fix it immediately! And they did. I then messaged Temu and told them the story and explained it all!!! I also had proof that PayPal mentioned how Temu was no longer part of the dispute. Customer service was usually always rude and not understanding at all! They would tell me how they have sent my info to the specialist team and escalated it for immediate attention and to watch for an email. But every single time I?€?d get that email, it was the SAME RESPONSE!! Even though I?€?d keep showing them the proof and  explaining it over and over again. Did I ever get an actual response? Nope! It was always a stupid automated response!!! My blood has been boiling!!! They?€?d keep saying how it?€?s because of an ongoing dispute I have going on and how I need to be patient and try another payment method later. And like usual I?€?d tell this ?€?robot?€? that there IS NO DISPUTE and that I?€?ve tried every single card I have! I gave up. I can?€?t get a real person for the life of me!! So I tried using my boyfriends phone on his Temu account and used my own card. Guess what?? They BLOCKED HIM TOO!! Wth????? I give up! It?€?s NOT FAIR!!! Especially since I did NOTHING WRONG!!!! Over a month of this crap and I?€?m finally done!!",1,17/04/2024
I am very impressed - on my third order . I bought a lot of items for my cat and dog in my first order and love everything . I ordered wall hammock for the cat and I have ordered similar from Shein in the past  and the quality from Temu is superior- it is bigger and much sturdier ?€? and was cheaper in Temu!  There was an issue with one item in my second order but I was refunded immediately with no fuss. I am waiting for the third order and hopefully it will be as good as he rest.,5,17/04/2024

The shipping only took a week, although they didn't mention any drop off when they shipped the item.",5,17/04/2024
"The only issue I've had is with item quality or breakage in transit, but the refund system is extremely simple, and in some cases I've been offered vouchers back and refunds on items where I feel it wasn't necessary and a price adjustment might have been better. Solid customer service as a result, I highly recommend using Temu!",5,17/04/2024

"I have update my review mainly due to aftercare from Temu once I emailed Evelyn (as below) . Whilst I can't comment on the quality of clothing or any items I ordered as parcel was undelivered by Evri. However, Temu arranged to refund to my Klarna for full order value & also as goodwill gave me ??10 credit in my Temu account. Whilst they are going to investigate what happened to my parcel they have advised if it arrives to just keep the items. To be fair what more can Temu do in these circumstances? I realise ""things go wrong"" & it's how it's put right which makes a huge difference.They couldn't be any fairer than they have & have altered my review score to highlight this. It gives me much more confidence in any future purchases should I ever do so.",4,17/04/2024
Made an order with the expected delivery date 10 June and I am still awaiting this. Now today?€?s date is 14 June. I have left several messages and still no reply.,1,17/04/2024
"I would give it a 6* if I could!!! Oh my goodness I am in LOVE!!! I have already spent soooo much money on here, it has EVERYTHING. I am so so happy with every product received and can't wait to continue using TEMU. I tell everybody about it and I've saved stupid amounts of money. The delivery is SO fast and you are updated from start to finish on where your stuff is, spot on every time. I've been very fortunate to not have had a single thing missing from any order and I've had loaaaaads. The staff are clearly working stupidly hard from the minute they get the order. So fingers crossed the service, products and prices stay the same!! I love the fact I can go to temu for anything I need now, hardly go anywhere else since I found it! Really really don't understand how it hasn't scored a higher rating than a 3.3, definitely underestimated. Well done and thank you TEMU!! ???",5,18/04/2024
"Firstly, price is not that much different compare to Amazon, the original price listed on the website is massively inflated.Secondly, the quality is the worst, you get those cheap Chinese products which would not last a week. I ordered 10 things for my dog, 2 of those just cannot be used out of the box because they are so broken. My advice is that, avoid this website at all cost, buy from Amazon as they have much better quality control, review and refund process.",1,18/04/2024
"This company offers many 'specials' and 'promotions', such as 'free items' where all you need to do is share a link to invite people to download the Temu app within a 24 hour period and sign up, simple enough right.... WRONG!!They continuously move the goal post by lowering the effect each new sign up has, until it basically has no affect, so essentially you will never get the free gift...no matter how many people you inviteBiggest waste of time and scam around!I will be telling everyone i can to uninstall and not to trust or use this company",1,18/04/2024
"Recieved a bad parcel, packed as a tight ball. I made pictures of this. Inside the blouse all crushed. Not the fabric as per picture, not the size promissed. realy a desaster. The soap box cannot hold a normal soap bar and will top over. If it is to good to be true, it is not true. Remember this. Never ever again buy at Temu.",1,18/04/2024
"Been using them for a while, any issue refunded without questions asked.. they update you with delivery etc all the time until it?€?s delivered, free delivery for limited period cheap. Same items are triple the price sold in amazon and eBay.I hear lot of people crying that they collect data, as if our government doesn?€?t, our government has CCTV stuck on us and watch every single move we make but yet we complain about other, please stop these blame games and enjoy buying these cheap items, way cheaper than those sold on eBay and Amazon.. make the most of it before they start increasing the price and start charging for delivery.",5,18/04/2024
"I?€?ve had absolutely no issues with Temu. Ordered twice now and it?€?s all been great. Very similar to Wish and SHEIN. Obviously don?€?t expect the quality to be top notch for the price, but it serves a purpose and everything I?€?ve had has worked / been absolutely fine ????",5,18/04/2024
"I have bought many items so far and I love their policies, fast shipping, price adjustment, hassle free return, speedy refund. It is up to you to choose good quality items and be a smart shopper. I have bought five pairs of shoes so far and I am speechless with their quality. I read some people talk about losing your privacy to another country. Really ! who cares. As if you have privacy in your own country. In this time of insane inflation, at least Temu enables families to meet their needs in an affordable way and people can buy items for their children while they couldn't do it in any other way with crazy prices in the store.",5,18/04/2024
"Placed my first order. Lost in transit. Refund given and had to argue to get price adjustments so I could reorder my items without having to incur additional costs. That parcel is now ""awaiting shipment"" and has been for 8 days. Customer service agents won't help with issues, and all ""refunds"" are given in credit rather than original payment method. Beware!",1,18/04/2024
"I recently ordered from Temu and when my package was delivered someone unfortunately stole it. The post office was no help. However, after Temu was as contacted they quickly reshipped my order which I was very thankful for since it was clear I would have never received it back. This made my day!",5,18/04/2024
"destroying local markets. illegal in most countries. they only get ""permission"" via bribes and corruption. This Chinese company has destroyed most of Africa. Do NOT support as it is ruining economies...",1,18/04/2024
"5 ???     I don't write many reviews but today I am pleasantly surprised by the goods I received from Temu...The stuff ordered was so cheap and free postage I didn't expect great things but they are all fine..Scourers for pots,  perfect.Sludge for cleaning hard to get at corners, brilliant. Sticker for my toilet looks great and eyebrow clippers for my grampa look fine.Lastly an item for defuzzing legs etc, actually works. Fraction of the price I've seen them...I will be ordering again.",4,18/04/2024
I bought several handbags from temu along with lingerei more than happy with what I've bought  & will continue to purchase from temu.,5,18/04/2024
Having fell for a scam before I was a bit sceptical but friends and family had ordered and had great experiences. I made an order and was a bit disappointed because my date for delivery was just before I was due to go on holiday and I'd hoped to take some stuff with me. Well I'm sooo happy it has come in time and it's all fab! I'm very happy as I'm looking to do a full revamp of my wardrobe over the next wee while. Thank you to the Temu team I was kept informed of every step of the way and I can't fault anything. I'll be browsing as soon as I'm back home!!,5,18/04/2024
I havehad two multi orders from temu....they are excellent .Goods are really good and delivery is superb x,5,18/04/2024
Placed an order 6/10 and then decided to order additional houselhold products like cordless car vaccum and sink stopper since there was an option to spend another $15 to get a $15 off coupon - so basically free stuff. After looking at some of the 1 star reviews I decided to wait until I received the items from my original order. Will update this review when items arrive and are inspected.,1,18/04/2024
"Hello,Not going to lie I was a bit worried about my first order I placed after reading the negative reviews but there was also good. I spent ??75 & worth every penny, please please please don?€?t read just the negative comments & judge badly on temu if you haven?€?t even purchased. I?€?m 100% fully satisfied customer/purchase, clothing all came in their own separate bags in 1 big orange temu bag. Will I be ordering again? YES???????? I ordered clothing for myself, partner & my 2 young boys & couple of toilet brushes, well packaged & cannot fault the material of clothing. Me and my partner are slim, mostly a skinny medium. We ordered mediums but I do recommend going for a small. Have a bit of baggy which not fussed, I just know in future order smalls in tops. Boys short sets are perfect!I have been updated every step of the way, I ordered on the 2nd of June. My order was delivered today which is the 13th june 2023, my delivery date was 12-15th of june.Please bare in mind everything has bad & good reviews, im glad I ordered.  Evri delivered my package, no fault at all. Delivered with care/kind& respectful.Thank you temu????",5,19/04/2024
i only recently became aware of this business. With the old mantra ringing loud and clear in my head (if it sounds too good to be true it probable is) well i can now dispel that particular saying this company has just supplied me with a piece of clothing at a price that was hard to believe when i received it i feared the worse but was i wrong the item is excellent on time i was able to follow the journey of the item the entire way overall a great job.,5,19/04/2024
"It was decent product. However, ordered rhinestones labeled 1440 pcs and after coming up short, counted every single bead in a new pack and it runs around 950 pcs. So about 500 pieces short of what they are selling you. False advertisement of product amount.",2,19/04/2024
My first order from Temu and i was surprised at the quality of the products for the price i paid. Free delivery and  everything was well packaged and secure. They dispatched quickly and my order arrived a couple of days earlier than the given dates which i was pleased about. My only complaint is that evri is the delivery firm. They knock at the door throw the parcel in the garden then run off before i have time to even open the door. This isnt just with Temu it is every parcel they deliver. I live on a very busy street on outskirts of a city centre and a lot of people can see parcels just being left outside.,5,19/04/2024
"Placed 1st order for some home stuff and half of my order came defective. Returned the items using the label they provided on 6th June but they never updates the status as if I still haven't posted it. Evri tracking shows it's been going back to them since 8th June. Contacted Temu customer service, they said their system didn't have my return shipping label. I will never shop there again. What a scam. If I need cheaply made Chinese stuff, SheIn is better. Btw there's so many k-beauty Chinese replicas on Temu. Don't fall for it. If you want k-beauty products, Yesstyle has genuine products.[Edit: Temu tried to prove if my experience was genuine or they would take this review down. Sadly, the return status remains the same as if I haven't sent it at all. If they spend as much effort on the right area of their business, no one would leave a 1-star review, right?]",1,19/04/2024
"Temu as a company can be trusted, but not every seller doing the right things. Temu had refunded a false product (a 128GB Kodak SD card's capacity only reached 34.45GB) within few minutes once I uploaded pics. And there's no need to return that card.",4,19/04/2024
"Bad delivery service!  They throw, dump leave packages everywhere but your front door!  Our security camera caught the guy throwing the package on our lawn mind you and you can hear the items inside breaking!",1,19/04/2024
"Here we go again. Round 4. I purchased the colourful crystal branch pendant & the womens block heel mid calf boots in black. Just stunning. Believe me the pics don't do alot for the boots but once you look, try & wear. They are absolutely stunning. Thank you Temu your delivery is prompt & your prices are very affordable. I am so happy.",5,19/04/2024
"Very long wait to receive products that were poorly made with cheap materials. This is such poor quality it began falling apart after a single wash.The shorts I ordered were the wrong size. The shirt was missing three buttons.After receiving a reply from Temu I have decided to close my account with them. The reply was paste and copy response, that tells me they get a lot of complaints and that they really don't care. They also that claims to have quality control and accurate description policies. That is a ??ie as this was second order from them with the same issues.",1,19/04/2024
I don't really care as long as they come through with the shipping. I ordered all our stuff to see how it goes.,5,19/04/2024
Poor service -poor returns service - poor goods quality I would not recommend using this company in my experience!!!!!! Weeks of endless live chats with no solution- evri confirms they returned the goods proof of returning goods. Yet Temu say they have not !!! Weeks of endless chat !!! -,1,19/04/2024
"My order arrived today 3 day?€?s early excellent. My order is amazing absolutely will buy again, I was abit nervous but I?€?m already got loads in my basket to order.Please buy I recommended Temu.",5,19/04/2024
"I believe this e-commerce site is just another version of Shein. They offer you free products if you invite others but it didn't work for a lot of people because they blocked some of the invitations due to security reasons. However, customer service gave me ??5 credit. I also noticed that every ad says that buy this for a low price with free shipping but when you land on the app it then tells you that min order value should be ??10 (or high) and the offer is valid for a few minutes, which means I had to buy things that I don't need.I believe they should improve the marketing strategy and don't put pressure on the customers to buy instantly.",2,19/04/2024
Paid quite a lot for basically cheap tat. If I'd seen it before I wouldn't have wasted my money. Nothing is good out of anything and the solar lights are tiny. I'd think very carefully before you waste your money as much better quality can be bought for very little more in the UK,1,19/04/2024
"Great company ,refunded twice fully and also told to keep items,to do whatever with,always on time and quality stuff so far very pleased .",5,19/04/2024

Absolutely ???? fantastic customer service. All items I purchased were in fantastic condition. I was happy with everything I bought. Everything arrived on due date. This was my 1st ever purchase and I will be definitely buying from Temu again and again. I personally highly recommend ???? per cent.Thank you Temu ????,5,19/04/2024
Brilliant app .. love the products love the games won loads of prizes just by sharing the link 3 pairs trainers and a top .. I definitely am recommending ?????????? also if delivery is late it credits you ??5 . And if price drops you can get the money bavk of the price adjustment what other app does that . Brilliant ????,5,19/04/2024
"I ordered several little bits for my granddaughters, didn?€?t spend a lot as it was our first time and we were trying it out , thought if order didn?€?t come we?€?re not loosing  too much, will definitely order from here again, products were good quality and came very quick,  I would definitely recommend,",5,19/04/2024
If i could give a 10* review i would seriously i love this shop items come quicky safely wrapped amazingly with care and ive only just found this shop and never going anywhere else ive already had 3 big deliveries amazing items you look online and find things you never know you needed to make a family of 6 lives easier,5,19/04/2024
"I was wary of ordering so my first order was just over ??10 so that it qualified for free shipping and it wasn't going to break the bank if it went wrong. After ordering I got a tracking number and a link to keep up to date with the delivery. It was delivered on time and the items I ordered were perfect. I've since placed 2 more orders spending more each time and everything has been excellent. Amazing prices for the products, delivery has been easy to track and everything has arrived in time.",5,19/04/2024
"This company doesn't take responsabilities over delivery: they let your pacakge on the street and if it get stolen like in my case, they refused to refund you because the carrier provider put a delivery date on the package. I have been refunded by paypal. Also the customer support of Temu is managed by bots, no way you can talk to actual humans.",1,19/04/2024
"Ordered in car storage unit, received half a web cam, cables for a volt meter(no volt meter) Tapping tool and what I think are three acupuncture needles. Looks like someone just grabbed the nearest objects and sent them. Not worth the cost of sending back .Put it down to experience not to use them again.",1,19/04/2024
"So far so good.  I have brought some lovely things. Fast free delivery.  Free easy returns. I'm sure that not everything is perfect,  but so far I've had no problems.",5,19/04/2024
"Absolute cheap tat, and of course from China. Should've read the reviews first, thought was from Europe, will never use again. Product nothing like in picture and delivery is direct from China so long long wait time for ultimate disappointment. Beware.",1,19/04/2024
"FYI on Returns/RefundsI gave the company a chance and I regret it.  The only saving grace is I paid for my purchase with PayPal. At 1st everything seemed fine but when I saw nothing had shipped by the 5th day I contacted Temu to find out what the issue was.  Over the course of several hours I was told all of the following by various Temu Reps.1-The item is out of stock2-The order shipped here is the information (Bogus Tracking # provided)3-It shows you canceled this order a few hours after placing it.  Your refund will take time to process.4-Your item shows as being prepared for shipment.5-""Sorry the e-mail you entered has been disconnected or is no longer in service.""Ok so the last one was a joke but I was honestly waiting for something like that to happen. By the time I got the 4th response I was already on the phone with PayPal. The only recommendation I can make is if you risk buying from this place make sure you use something like PayPal.  Or a card that As a fraud department that will go to bed for you get scammed.PayPal took the reins and That was that.  The company refused to even correspond with PayPal so they Reverse to the payment and blocked further transactions from Temu. I know some people have had great luck with this company but I am not one of them.  Everyone I have spoken to that has ordered something that costs more than $10 has a horror story similar to mine.  Bottom line is don't risk it unless you want to name your stress induced ulcer after the company.  It is just not worth it.",1,19/04/2024
"Temu gave me a refund in temu credits, then raised the minimum checkout limit so I couldn?€?t buy anything. I believed that the limit was  able to be bypassed with credits. Now they refuse to give me my money back to my card.SORT IT OUT",1,20/04/2024
"I I absolutely love temu .iv ordered 17 times now! Won an airfryer, ??90 credits,  orders arrived on time,  some cheap crap yea but they refund you super easy . Also price adjustments if your orders drop in price.  99% of stuff iv gotten is perfect.",5,20/04/2024

"One slightly drunken evening I found a Temu and on Facebook. They enticed me with a pair of lairy patchwork trousers for ??1.50. So I ended up buying 2 pairs of trousers and 2 pairs of spec's all for ??21 Took a couple of weeks to arrive and although I won't be wearing the patchwork trousers (what was I thinking, I'm 60)The other trouser's and glasses are great. Good quality and great value. Will definitely buy from Temu again.",5,20/04/2024
The products I bought were delivered on time and in excellent condition. Nothing was wrong with the products. I was afraid that since the prices were so low I would be getting junk. Not So. I will be sending in another order shortly.,5,20/04/2024

"At first, I was very hesitant because of the bad reviews and how cool it looks online and how low the prices are. It seems like it?€?s too good to be true. Then I have decided to give it a try. I have ordered tank tops and hoodies. I just received my first order today. I?€?m very surprised and I?€?m very satisfied with the quality,the design and especially the discounts. In fact, I?€?m placing my second order. I highly recommend this site. It?€?s legit. I?€?m not sure what other customers have ordered and was not satisfied. But personally, I?€?m very surprised.

I?€?ve also placed two orders. All the items arrived within the estimate time frame and had clear step by step tracking of where they were. The vast majority of the items were a lot better quality than expected for the price paid for them, would certainly recommend this site to others for cheap items of a decent quality.",5,20/04/2024

"I already had ordered thrice from this site, and they all arrived ahead of schedule. They are using La Poste in France, which has the options for a drop off at the post office in case you are not available. I find it nice to have it here, because in Asia, we used to have Lazada or Shopee. Here in France, I only know Amazon, and although I have bought some items there, the price comparably is the cheaper. If I need to buy something once in a while, then I will go to check it in temu.",4,21/04/2024

Keep up the good work????????",5,21/04/2024
I have read negative reviews about Temu but in all honesty I have nothing but the  best experience to date shopping online .Sceptical at first but now I can say top class service .I had received a item I purchased in good time with tracking all the way till delivery.The item I purchased didn?€?t fit me and with in 24 hours a full credit on my account before I even sent the paid postage item back.What more can anyone ask for .So far 5 stars .Good work guys and gals .Just to add that you get what you pay for .I dont expect much for the price if the price is cheap.Having  said that the items i purchased even tho low price were have done the job.,5,21/04/2024
"Loving Temu so far.  Have made several orders, I started with some very cheap orders to test it out first, all have arrived without issue and items were as expected.  Clothing sizes are more consistent to NZ sizing than I have experienced with other similar online retailers where it is often quite a guess to order the correct sizes, and overall the quality has been perfectly acceptable, considering the low prices. I would even be prepared to say the quality is better than that found in some of our budget type stores here in NZ such as K Mart and The Warehouse.  Overall so far I am very happy with my experience, which has included an extremely fast refund (within a couple of hours of making the refund request the money was back in my account) when I ordered the wrong sized shoes (which they did not require me to return).  Delivery has also been more timely overall than I have experienced with other sites, such as Lightinthebox.  I will happily continue to use.",5,21/04/2024
"Dear temu. Yesterday i posted a review on here. Your reply is false so obviously you never read it properly so i am going to simplify it for you.1, I had no difficulties.2, I said when you get to pick a ""PRESENT"" it does not matter which one you choose as you always get the best prize which makes it false. There is no point having 3 presents you may as well just have 1.3,Then the wheel no point spinning it you always 1st spin get 10.4, Then you pick one more box and you always get the ""EASY MODE"".5, Finally. 1st spin gold silver bronze or platinum Everyone get Gold until spending then Platinum. Bronze and silver may as well not exist.As for freebies its all rubbish stuff. As for mens clothes. No top makes. Health and beauty no top makes. Basically its all rubbishAnd when you erase your profile and delete the site you still get emails which is annoying",1,21/04/2024
Extremely pleased with this Web site.. have ordered many times. And love how quickly it arrives.. only thing I think they could do better.... is to have each item wrapped separately as sometimes hard to figure out which item was from which order.,5,21/04/2024

My address was wrong on the order by mistake and they were sooo unhelpful!!! The person at the other address didn?€?t accept the package and asked the Evri delivery man to take it back.

"My first order was for shoes and I was disappointed ???? and returned the entire order. I then decided to order some glass smoking pipes and was extremely happy.

"I have yet to complete a task which I believe is because I spent money with them. I do my tasks day after day, add friends to get so many coins to complete tasks yet I still fail them. After numerous complaints in chat they gave me ??5 compensation credit (not coupons but credit) but I can't spend it because I have to spend ??20 before I can use it. Yet people have had hundreds of pounds worth of freebies one girl I know (someone I recommended) has had thousands and not spent a penny. The stuff I have had (paid for ) have been lovely not a problem but don't be suckered into the tasks because they know you will give in and spend. I recommended someone this morning and they were told there was something suspicious about their signup. I know the girl personally.",1,21/04/2024
"Great, it arrived in about a week, everything arrived in perfect condition. It was all exactly as described. So happy. ??????",5,22/04/2024
"This is a superb wee company . Everything I have ordered so far , has been very good value for money . Better quality than I have had from more expensive shops . I have only ordered clothes so far , but , I definitely don't have any complaints. Quick delivery , up to date shipping updates, and I will certainly be ordering again.",5,22/04/2024
After reading reviews I was a bit sceptical but after receiving my items I?€?m more than sure that a lot of these bad reviews are just from unhappy people very pleased with my items,5,22/04/2024
"Stay away from this BS Chinese Based CompanyOrder No PO-211-20390594232950815. They sais they delivered the Package but I never received it!!!!Why I did not stick with Amazon. Never had an Issu like that.If U want to save fyour Money Never ever buy from this CompanyUpdate Jun-09-2023I got the package. USPS had not delivered the package although it showed ""Delivered on Jun 5th"" on its tracking system. They delivered it just today!!. So, Temu did its job but the Courier did not. They should Use another Courier, USPS is not a good one.",5,22/04/2024
Whilst I realise every thing is cheap and cheerful I purchased a Ultra watch obviously a rip off of the Apple but most worrying is one of the few apps that function are the health one that give the most dangerous and misleading ECG and BP readings.Really this sort of things should not be allowed to be sold in the UK and trading standard should be involved,1,22/04/2024
"If something is too good to be true then generally it is. I came across Temu and saw that they had a Big And Tall clothing section. I take a 4X in t shirts and when I saw their prices and the awesome designs my heart leapt. It's expensive buying bigger clothes so I thought I'd give it a go. Firstly, the delivery was relatively rapid and the designs on the t shirt look incredible. But who the hell are they made for? There's no one on this planet that's a 4X + that can comfortably wear these polyester monstrosities. So I thought let's try a size bigger and ordered a 5X only to be in the same situation. There's little, if any, difference in the sizing. To satisfy my curiosity,  I placed an order for a 6X to see if there's any difference. I should've known that a 4X t shirt at just a few ??????'s is way too good to be true. I'm currently cold washing them to see if the material may relax but I already know that they won't. I'm more disappointed than i should be because I thought I'd finally found a way to look nice and not pay a fortune.  I guess the world is not meant for big people",1,22/04/2024
"Excellent website, offers a huge array of products at amazing prices. Good quality items all fully tracked. Returns easy, they also offer price adjustments within one month of ordering so if an item you?€?ve purchased reduced in price you can request a refund of the different which again is very easy to do. I?€?ve ordered about 9 times, love it, I?€?m a TEMU obsessive. Great site",5,22/04/2024
Absolutely dreadful - the material ripped tobits the very first day I wore it - I put it straight in the bin.  Cheap nasty rubbish,1,22/04/2024
Thus far I have no complaints re Temu after 4 separate purchases. The first 3 have arrived on time. I have ordered the 4th which has yet to be delivered.,5,22/04/2024
"Still TEMU is not Worth to get at least 1 star. When I received Most of the items are Cheap, and I straight away unsubscribed,  blocked and deleted the app. very low quality, and unbranded products. I don't want to wast my time for this ??20 Worth, but when I see my comment was flag down that's why I step up with proof of photos . I just tested one of the tools not steel. They are just the poorly made metals. No need to check others. You can see the quality when you carefully check the photos. I Will send the photos when you need. There is no way to send through this review..         Very good branded quality products we can buy from aldi and lidl for decent price. I never ever recommend TEMU to anyone. I never comment on trustpilot or anywhere without reason. If I have a genuine experience I Will comment. and I don't want to wast my time for comments without reason. TEMU's items are here as it is. be careful when anyone order from TEMU.",1,22/04/2024
I am very happy with Temu. I order 3 times. The products were good and I've got them very quick. Also my contact with the costumer service was a good experience. Thank you!,5,22/04/2024
"First time ordered of this retailer was a little concerned about the reviews, but I'm going to give 5 stars item come within a week, perfect condition and all my dressers & tops fitted perfect I'm a curvy size 12/ 14 but ordered size Large and they fitted perfect, the only issue was that our Evri driver just dumped the package on our doorstep for anyone to steal , by luck we have a door bell ring and we asked our neighbour to bring the item in , overall I will definitely order off you again thanks .",5,22/04/2024
I was very pleased with my items though two of my crystals were damaged I won't be sending them back but I'm afraid to order more incase its the same. Delivery was fast tracking update was excellent overall I  was very pleased with my order,5,22/04/2024
"After a shaky start, Temu quickly resolved my issues and I now have my goods! Nice products for the price! Thank you Temu, I'll be back!",5,22/04/2024

"I have ordered twice and both times all products as described, service is excellent. Thanks",5,22/04/2024
Thought the prices were too good to be true...but thought I'd order anyway. Was so very happy with all of my order (the dresses especially). The communication was excellent and I was notified at every stage where my order was. Everything arrived within a week. I have recommended to all my friends and have already placed my next order,5,22/04/2024
Received my order today - all good except the pair of Bunion Corrector - would have helpful to have instructions as to how to wear the product properly.   Other items purchased were good and I was satisfied with these other items.,4,22/04/2024
"I have ordered several shirts off Temu. I absolutely love the styles they have. The quality is so so. But I have been wearing them without issue and actually bought for traveling over seas because they are cheap, easy to wash and dry by hand and don't wrinkle. Shipping sometimes takes awhile but if they are late past a guaranteed date you get $5 off your next order. Shipping is free with a $10 order. I've been very happy. Just realize you are not getting high quality products but for the price you can't beat it.",5,22/04/2024
TEMU has some fun stuff and great prices. Clothing is decent quality but the size range is all over the place. Also I e notice if I return something for whatever reason it no longer allows me to write a review. Therefore most bad reviews are not seen. My next return I?€?ll write the review before I return and see how it goes. I do like them and have ordered a bunch with 80% being good.,4,22/04/2024
Theres a lot of negative reviews on temu but it?€?s actually quite good.Good support temu and good help.Average China app but the items arrive in 9/10 good conidions.I?€?ve received 3 orders and all of them came within the time it predicted ( between a week) and in good conditions. I?€?ve even won a few things and it arrived i good condition!10/10 from me!,4,22/04/2024

"Affordable products.You can find many good quality products. It has a review section so you can check if the product is good or not but usually it is nice.Products were delivered to me before the delivery date, within two weeks.",5,22/04/2024
"I bought several random items , must say that with sale price + coupon it?€?s okay , but I wouldn?€?t be happy with these items if full priced.For children?€?s toys is ok , but i wouldn?€?t necessarily buy again , only because I prefer quality products that will last .",4,22/04/2024
"I was very wary of using this company, but I'll give it a go spent Just over ??20 as a tester.What a great experience gave a date and came 2 days before, Kept giving me updates on my phone about my parcel.A bit gutted I didn't know you get a discount for a first buyer.I will be buying from them again and told my friends & Family it's safe to use.",5,22/04/2024
I've placed 3 recent orders all were delivered on or before the given date. Quality of the goods was good for the price.,5,22/04/2024
"Trainers arrived in about 2 weeks. The trainers where a bit thinner than expected but seem strong. Item was left on door step but luckily was still there.The app is a bit annoying with all notifications, so I turned off notifications.",4,23/04/2024
"I have purchased LOADS of craft supplies, including silicone molds, jewelry making and fairy garden figures.  These have all been excellent quality and some are duplicates of ones I've purchased on Amazon - exactly the same, top notch!  I would give them 5 stars if I could chose shipping services - but Temu's customer service has been extremely helpful when a shipper fails, really great customer service.",4,23/04/2024
I have ordered 3 time in the last month and been satified with all but one item(ladies dress which was too big and short for me)was filling return form out and was told to keep the item and they would refund my money which they did within a few days.I am just going to order my next order.one happy customer.,5,23/04/2024

THIS SITE IS AMAZING!!! It has almost anything you can think of, from cool trinkets costing less then $1 to better quality stuff and even quality electronics, THINK OF IT LIKE A HARBOR FREIGHT or AMAZON with all of their no name brand stuff, a lot of low to mid quality stuff but with some amazing treasures hidden amongst, just scrolling the homepage, EVEN THO NOT ALL NAME BRAND STILL QUALITY, always read your reviews of anything you?€?re buying online, that will save you from having to give a bad oneTHESE BUYS ARE AMAZING!!!FREE SHIPPING ON ALL 10 DAY SHIPPING (stated on site) can?€?t hold company responsible for customs clearance!GREAT TRACKING OF ITEMSI have ordered multiple items now, received notifications for all with tracking number and detailed info.I will ????% be using them probably even more then Amazon",5,23/04/2024
"I love the stuff they have. So much cheaper than other online similar stores. The clothes can be more expensive.Kitchen items are great, and so much choice. Free shipping is a really serious selling point for me. Downside is stuff that is not properly wrapped or not wrapped at all. A tin plate sign was bent in 2 places.",5,23/04/2024
The price looks great but your giving your details away. I just had a random call from a chinese man (from the accent). This never happens before until I install this app. BEWARE they are watching youIncluding me and 2 friends got a message about Chinese girl looking for a husband and a what's up link.We only started getting these as soon we install temu app.,1,23/04/2024
"I absolutely love Temu! It?€?s my kind of thing! I?€?ve loved everything I?€?ve bought since May 2023 - in fact it?€?s quite addictive!

"I found the whole experience a joy. Added items to my original order ,final total being over ??40 then found out I could have used a ??8 discount voucher. Live chat with Janet v.

My refund is in my bank, and notification this morning informs me items have been despatched.ALL THIS WITH IN 24 HOURS WELL DONE TEAM TEMU thank you regards linda",5,23/04/2024
"Can't fault my experience tbh. Like most, I was dubious at first with the massive discounts, but all seems legit.Placed an order for 5 totally random bits n bobs as a test and all came through on time and as described.My only reason for not giving 5 starts is the app can be a bit in your face. Lots of self-promotion and attempts to make you spend that little bit more.All in all, a win!",4,23/04/2024

"After ordering in a hurry and being enticed by cheap prices, I read trust pilot and thought, ah well, I?€?ve probably just been had. Bummer.To my great surprise, my entire order arrived promptly, in one parcel, less than a week later (in Australia), all articles exactly as described.The quality is as expected. I?€?m very satisfied and will definitely order again. Maybe Temu have lifted their game?",5,23/04/2024

"I ordered tools for my workshop. Sadly I get women's clothes. I tried to get my order. But I must send back the tools, because the package arrived. I tried to contact TEMU but there is only a Chinese-Chat-ROBOTER. How can I send back the tools, when I get women's clothes...? When I read the comments, there are most FAKE. Bad service, very bad service. Cash cow for dummies. Sadly, I am the one....If you need womens clothes in xxl, just order tools.....Reply of TEMU is wrong. There is a roboter Chat and there ar allways the same questions. I must send back the parts I never get. I can`t send back the women clothes. Your answer is wrong. I had a ticket number, but you don`t answer...",1,23/04/2024
"I see negative stuff posted about Temu. My sister sent me an article today bashing them. I know it comes from China but so does just about everything at Walmart. I have been very happy with every purchase, communication and always delivered a week from the time I placed the order. Zero complaints!",5,23/04/2024
I was very sceptical about this company but I went ahead and placed an order?€? Delighted I was what a company the items I ordered were just as stated and free p&p and delivered by Evri. I have since ordered other items and just as delighted.. Thank you,5,23/04/2024

won loads of items for free .. cant grumble at free stuff even won ??610 credit 2 spend iv had all my parcels i think its a great site ????,5,23/04/2024
I saw the Temu website and thought prices were to good to be true. An amazing range of products. Some I have seen on web sites double and more on price.So ordered a bunch of items. Order confirmed. Delivery exactly as confirmed. Arrived on time.One of the items had a problem. Filled in the details and to my surprise it was sorted. Thank you Temu,5,23/04/2024
"After being a bit sceptical about the products arriving, they did and it was very quick delivery too. Overall great experience.",5,24/04/2024
"Given the price didn't have high expectations but products not even meet Taobao quality. Ridiculous return arrangement, their courier does not even accept the box Temu used. Saying it's too large. Customer Service gives me random but not feasible ideas trying to trick me to go to the courier again to see if they will accept. Even though I have told them it's a 40 mins walk carrying the parcel. Slow CS response.Not taking any action to help customers. Trying to push responsibility to customers and punish customers physically for their inability to arrange return logistics.  If you have to buy from them, don't buy large items, avoid bulk purchases, split your order in case you need to return everything, and prepare boxes or pouches to pack the returns at your own cost.",1,24/04/2024
"Spent ??85 on Temu and all the items I received are faulty and useless to use , cheap tat from china !! Contacted Temu through email told me to contact their customer service through my account . WAITED HOURS JUST TO BE CUT OFF !! Disgusting service , received faulty items opened a return and I was notified by Temu I?€?ll only receive a refund if the items pass the inspection. I?€?m not being mugged off ! I want my money back now & I?€?ll be closing my account as soon as I receive my money . I reported them to klarna too as this website is A scam, the amount of things I?€?ve seen about it is unreal . Don?€?t waste your money on cheap tat that don?€?t even work",1,24/04/2024

"I returned a parcel on Temu by Evri (Tracking No. H0471D0000223456) but the delivery status has not updated on the system. I reached out to the support team and waited 3 hours in the Live Chat queue to speak with Andy Zhu and that was painfully slow, he kept me on hold for an eternity.

"My very first-time transaction with TEMU was terrible.I ordered a pair of earbuds for a new app user.A few days later, I received a package from TEMU but the wrong item was delivered it was some hooks with magnets. I have returned the item. A few days later, I received a message from TEMU saying that my refund was rejected because the item was correct.How is this possible? So I went through the support process and I chose the 'wrong package delivered' and it said I can get the refund instantly if I accept it as store credit. but it will take 4-14days if I want a refund same as I paid.I have wasted a lot of my time and I will never buy anything from them.",1,24/04/2024
I love Temu ! This company is awesome ! The items I have bought from them have been exactly as described and the delivery is ultra swift. Temu gives a great service and I will continue to buy from them. Well done Temu !,5,24/04/2024
"Once again I am disgusted with TEMU. This site is full of copyright infringements. I just found 16 more listings in their wedding section that are counterfeits of my original jewelry designs and they are using my copyrighted photos to sell them, some are even photos of my daughter. Can you imagine having photos of your teenage daughter stolen by these thieves and plastered all over these Chinese websites to use solely for their commercial purposes and profits with out permission.These manufacturers steal designs and photographs from North American designer's websites and then start mass producing them to sell. Please don't buy from these following stores they are thieves, their stores are full of stolen designs and photos from many other designers as well: Feltent Jewelry: AU00642, AB01837, MX00019, YN05498, DM01948, NE02039, PR05336, QH08506 Tuanming Jewelry: EG02127 Tatsu Bridal Accessories: LT08769, Mooslove: YX02716, WL02215 Niancan Jewelry: UV06852, GJ05756, GB04144, QH08506",1,24/04/2024

"Hi! So I honestly have no complaints about my first order from Temu. Aside from one dress fitting smaller that the XL that I'm used to, all other dresses fit, accessories are what they are for the price that I paid for which is fine for occasional wear. The lipstick I bought does not suit - will give to my friend.I was told it when to expect at time of ordering, Temu tracking kept me informed on where my package is and still got it sooner than the latest date (June 8th).  I've ordered from Amazon and still waiting on product from early May lol!I was a bit hesitant given other reviews but my honest one, I have no issues and will be ordering again.",5,25/04/2024
"I was sceptical about ordering from Temu as the items are very cheap. However, I ordered some festival accessories and whilst the quality isn?€?t the best, I got them very cheap so I expected the quality to be somewhat compromised. You can?€?t buy this cheap and expect top quality but it?€?s good for cheap bits you?€?ll only use once or twice. My order was tracked and delivered in good time. Despite negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised and I?€?d order again for cheap bits.",4,25/04/2024
I have shopped on temu a couple of times so far I have found customer service to very good refunds Sent quickly obviously some item better quality than others and I have bought various items at the end of the day you get what you pay for and I dont have any complaints the deliveries so far have always come before expected and tracking your order is so easy,5,25/04/2024

Took about 3 weeks to arrive although they take your money straight away!Cant get a refund. Spent ??19. They said the product is correct and can't I give it to someone else!

Been shopping with Temu for several months now. They have excellent products at low prices. Yes some items do feel cheap but so do most items at Walmart.  i bought a blood pressure monitor and a glucose monitor. Both are very accurate. I love their clothes.,5,25/04/2024
Ordered from Temu and still haven't recieved my order. Temu customer services tells me to contact Evri and they can't help. Evri says contact the sender.Temu has refunded me but I am still left without goods I wanted. First and last experience with this terrible companyUpdate - contacted TEMU and they told me to place the order again using my refunded amount. All items have gone up in price. No gesture to resend the parcel or to make contact with Evri. The reply below was a lie,1,25/04/2024

"While a lot of the products on Temu look good value for money, a lot is total rubbish and if something arrives damaged or faulty its impossible to contact them, I really mean impossible! I was waiting on their Live Chat for over an hour and got no where, just got cut off again and again. They also bombard you with text messages and emails, on one day alone I received 17 text messages and 9 emails.  By all means don't believe a word I say and order from them, fingers crossed it arrives in one piece and it actual works! I won't be ordering anything else.I have to add something after Temu replied with a scripted message which doesn't answer my complaint and just tell me everything I know already. They mention that I can contact them.via their live webchat, but clearly they haven't even read my comments because my main issue is the fact that its impossible to actual speak to someone on their live webchat, it tells you, your number in the queue, which is usually 60 something, and after waiting and waiting it might come down by 2 or 3, but then tells you due to inactivity you have been disconnected, even though I kept pressing continue waiting. Anyway I have learnt my lesson and i have deleted my account and if the reports i have been reading about Temu are correct they cannot be trusted,",1,26/04/2024
"Like most UK customers I was very sceptical ordering from a Chinese company via an app, I conducted a test purchase for a few small value items, items where delivered in less than six days from china to two ahead of scheduled delivery, very impressed I will be purchasing from them again after this satisfactory experience.",5,26/04/2024
"First order and I spent around ??50. As others have said you do get what you pay for, but the items I got were all decent. I bought sliders for my children at around ??1.30, the quality of them is decent, I wouldn't buy them from a retailer again. The clothes both boys and women's were acceptable. If you've ordered from SheIn before, then these are of similar quality. Other items I ordered were ear buds, car Bluetooth connector, pens, bag organiser, slippers, garden bottle hose connector, huggy wuggy and a set of 3 cricut boards. Honestly I was pleasently surprised. The delivery information was super efficient, informing me of every step. Of the process my package was going through.I ended up getting a discount on my first purchase, which made the already cheap amount even cheaper.I would definitely recommend for the odd bits and bobs.Remember if you're paying 80p for something that usually retails for much more then expect the quality to be lower.The app was easy to use and you can use your Klarna against payments.",5,26/04/2024
My first order of six acrylic food storage boxes would have gone well except for the fact that some idiot posted them with no protection in just a postal polybag all the way from china to uk and expected them to be okay they should have been sent in a box with protection three where damaged tried to claim refund but at the last stage their website was full of glitches so this could not be completed so had to take paypal case (still pending) to get refund I had high hopes for this company but I'll be going back to ali express,2,26/04/2024
I have used this company several times. No issues so far. Find the quality of goods as good as amazon.  Easy to order. Better than lightinthebox which is utter scam.,4,26/04/2024
"I was a little nervous placing my first order with temu.But now after 1 month of ordering I have been so satisfied. I don't understand why people are so negative. I had some products that were not to my satisfaction however, temu gave me credit for my returns ASAP. I have become a temuholic. I love this company and will continue to be a great supporter for this company. I'm staying with temu. Orlando FL.",5,26/04/2024
I seen the reviews some was great my son told me about this app so I hope all my items I receive be correct,5,26/04/2024
I've really had enough of being spammed by your company and I'm not interested in anything you're trying to sell to me and I'd like to be removed from your list of people to advertise to and the harassment and spamming have to stop right now and it's really hard when I'm on my flight trader 24 app when I'm trying to track airplanes that go by and I feel like I've been scammed by your company and that will not be tolerated around here and your advertising is very annoying and not interesting at all,1,26/04/2024
Most of my order was rubbish.  It was cheap but still not fit for purpose.,1,26/04/2024
"Another Positive Customer Experience from me. I have received 2x FREE LENOVO TH30 Headphones + 1x FREE LENOVO XT60 headset, of which i have tested and worked really well. The items were also packaged nicely and delivered on time.",5,26/04/2024
"I?€?ve order from Temu more than I care to admit. For the most part I have been quite satisfied. But the onus is on the customer to read the reviews posted by buyers and to check sizes and sometimes quantities. Items are often shown bigger than they actually are. Check sizes carefully. Also clothing items tend to be thinner fabric overall, but that being said, I?€?ve like the tshirts, etc that I?€?ve ordered, but again check the sizing. I think my biggest problem with Temu, is the way they ship items. I know the shipping is free but I?€?ve received damaged goods as they are crammed in as small a bag as possible. Temu will refund for damaged items though. I have found their customer service to be quite good. It?€?s automated for returns and refunds, so don?€?t expect contact with a real person.",4,26/04/2024
"They keep sending the wrong size shoe than what is clearly ordered. It happened twice and took over a month to get the return complete and SUPPOSEDLY the right size, but they did it again. They either can't read sizes or just don't care. Money lost! No more returns and delete that stupid app off of your phone. It's a tracker!Their little automated response below shows how bogus they are! 3 minutes???? Lol",1,26/04/2024
"Poor quality clothes , ordered loads not one nice material, all manmade polyester, terrible material , don't look a bit like online photos, So not recommend this app ,that's why it's cheap, cheap polyester material used for everything, never again",1,27/04/2024
"I had seen this website advertised, but I was wary until a friend said she used it and was impressed.  So I ordered a few things, I love gadgets and they were so cheap.  I was disappointed in a couple of things, but on the whole I was impressed.  I loved that they informed me every step of the way where my parcel was on it's journey to me.  Even more impressed that it came 2 days before it was supposed to.  I will definitely be using again.ps.  I don't know what people are talking about this gaining of credits with a game.  I didn't see any game, perhaps it's because I used a PC not a phone.",5,27/04/2024
"I agree I was sceptical to start with, therefore only spent ??12 for my first order. To my greatest surprise, delivery was within 72 hours and the items were actually great bargain for comfortable summer clothes! Thanks to Temu..for the deals! Have placed a second order. So if you are not so fussed about brands and labels, esp with bright travel clothes - this is your go to app/website ;)",5,27/04/2024
Great items and so cheap got more than expected can earn money by playing games,5,27/04/2024
"I found Temu great. Was worried at first ordering from them but I needn't have worried. Regular updates on my delivery. Received 2 packages so far. The tops I ordered fitted a treat.The gadgets I ordered not tried yet but will update shortly. My experience with Temu is great so far, definitely would recommend them. Prices are good. Sometimes you will get what you pay for. Happy customer. ????",4,27/04/2024
Despite some negative reviews I have shopped twice now and got some swimwear and few holiday bits cheaper than other retailers. My items were decent quality not sure what some are moaning about. We all can?€?t afford high end designer retailers. My swimwear is lovely. Saved myself about 40 quid in total. Came on time too and easy to track delivery. I will definitely bag myself some more holiday bargains.,5,27/04/2024
I ordered several items and was absolutely astonished at the quality and price. Definitely order again from Temu.,5,27/04/2024
"Bought a few things out of curiosity as ridiculously cheap, expecting all to be rubbish.  Temu did not disappoint.  Order delivered days late and products laughably poor.  The shoes were actually made of cardboard and smelled sooo offensively of glue and various chemicals.  Do not bother risking a purchase - you do get what you pay for, no bargains here.",1,27/04/2024
"Ordered a few things so can get the discounts they advertise when you bulk buy.A few things didn't arrive without any reason so now as i need those things, for me to buy them, id need to spend 100 pounds to get them at a discount or buy those things by themselves at 400% it's discounted price. IT'S A TRAP. Don't believe their discounted prices.Might as well go back to trustworthy eBay.",1,27/04/2024
I honestly was not expecting much from the items I ordered as the prices were so low however ALL of the products were fantastic quality.  I was very much a skeptic but now I am convinced & actually impressed enough to write this review & highly recommend this site,5,27/04/2024
"Just felt I needed to leave a review as there seem to be some bad reviews here but I had a fantastic experience. The time it takes for something to arrive is much faster than things I have bought from China before, about 7 to 10 days. And the time it takes to get a refund is about the same. But the process worked perfectly. I bought some trainers, loved them but too small. I returned them (UK address) and waited the given amount of time for refund to appear before buying a bigger size and leaving a review here. So its not the quickest but the prices are fantastic and refund was processed. Tick from me!",4,27/04/2024

"I was very sceptical at first, I was thinking these prices are too low, something is off here. So I ordered ??10 worth of items to classify for free delivery. It?€?s the exact same stuff as eBay and Amazon only miles cheaper as it cuts out the middle man who scams you of a another ??5 extra for each item. Just try it for yourself. Plus the price adjustment that they give if an item goes down and the credit promise if they don?€?t deliver on time is great too.",5,27/04/2024
"Terrible customer service!! I order 2 cables, I received one. But since I don't have a US phone number, I can't create an account - so I can't get any help in getting my second cable! I've tried Twitter, Facebook, and emails. NO SUPPORT AT ALL. They just keep telling me to create an account (WHICH I CAN'T WITHOUT A US PHONE NUMBER). So I have to give up and never get my replacemet cable. They had sent me an EMPTY bag. Really bad. DON'T USE THIS COMPANY!!",1,27/04/2024
"My daughters got lots referals from friends and ordered a bunch of free stuff, i initially thought this must be a scam, but eating my words, the goods arrived, we've since placed a few orders, no delivery issues. One of the items was faulty but a refund was quickly given. Temu is a competitor of eBay and Amazon, they lose out on delivery times as these can be a bit longer, but the prices def seem cheaper to me, i'm happy to wait a few extra days, plus you get lots of savings coupons once you sign up. I did see a previous review mentioning the security of the app, personally i don't see any issues, i pay via paypal using their multi factor authentication as i do with many online purchases.",5,27/04/2024
"I was a bit worried about using this site after reading some of the reviews but glad I took the chance and ordered some items,found it the best site I?€?ve used so fast at getting my order and very pleased with items I?€?ve purchased.but just make sure you check size of item you are buying,I have saved a fortune on items I have purchased and would recommend this site ,I use pay pal to pay for goods so have no worries about payments.i think other sellers should look at how Temu run their site and follow their example,well done and thank you got to go now more goods to order ????????",5,27/04/2024
"Literally everything in there is a knockoff design stolen from other creators and artists. I've been reporting em to the creators when I can, but its large-scale, fullstop pirated merchandise market. Just a few examples ive found were proprietary designs stolen from Lunafide clothing, and WazShop tapestries. I've reached out to the *actual* creators, and they confirmed these are illegally sourced, and their lawyers are working on it. Now Temu is trying to force me to take this review down.",1,27/04/2024
"Honestly?€?.I was very surprised and impressed with the product quality I ordered! I stopped dealing with Wish because their product always took way too long to arrive! Temu on the other hand is just a breath of fresh air. To date (two orders) the product has been delivered within two weeks. Having decided to ?€?Dip my toe in the water?€? I have to be perfectly honest here and say the stuff I bought has been of a pretty decent quality and so I remain impressed. Of course if it changes I will update this review, but for now I am going to make Temu my go-to online ordering experience. Cannot fault it ATM.",5,27/04/2024
Was slightly worried about ordering after reading all the negative reviews on here but decided to take a chance and see what happened. My parcel arrived on time and there was great communication throughout. Emails to say at what stage my parcel was at and communication with evri was also very good. My parcel arrived and was just as described. Not the best quality but for the price I paid I'm very pleased. The same item was triple the price on Amazon so this was a bargain!,5,27/04/2024
I have no issues with the company . Products arrive within the window it shows when ordering products . I ordered a shirt that was to big they said keep it and sent another one in different size . Have no problems with customer service. Prices are great cuz your cutting out the middle man .,5,27/04/2024
"Amazing prices and all clothes were amazing quality and fit really well, I ordered baby, young boys, older girls and womans. Really pleased with our order.",5,27/04/2024
"My parcel never arrived, contacted them to explain to be told. They can't do anything and that I suggest delivering to a safer address. My address is fine, its courier at fault for dumping my products outside, I NEVER gave you permission to leave my parcels outside. I understand things happen but there is no need for the offensive customer service i have recieved via email.Order number p0 21001655213097593943",1,28/04/2024
I ordered a few things as they make you tempted with offers. Shower head damaged the whole electric shower. Handheld massager does not charge.Car diagnostic machine is of very poor quality with basic functions.I don't recommend buying from this company. Only buy if you are willing to just waste money.,1,28/04/2024
"I had already ordered stuff from here when I saw posts about it on Facebook, thought well there goes ??40 but I have been pleasantly surprised. Items arrived quickly and are of good quality, really pleased with order. Just goes to show don't believe everything on social media. Will be buying from again.",5,28/04/2024
"I can't believe it, I got a leather bag for 16.00 bucks, I love this site, you can get quality items at a discounted rate and free shipping too. The company credited me five dollars for shipping late and I never even complained about it. I just purchased my second order of things that I needed, like pajamas perfume and total spending was less than 50 bucks and I have an option of breaking down my payments with Klarna... Very happy with Temu, very happy.",5,28/04/2024
"Prices look low but,advertised on YouTube by temu a car tyre inflater for ??1.98 via the app,so I downloaded the app and could I find a pump for ??1.98,no. Next as advertised on YouTube,wireless earplugs for less than a pound,could I find them,no. Not a good start to gain trust,needless to say the app was deleted . There is a robot to answer questions but it didn't understand any of my questions,so be careful if you order anything and you have problems because there robot understands less than my pet dogs  sorry temu you wasted my time. Trust pilot have asked to contact Tenmu to help resolve the matter,so I did and they couldn't find a pump for ??1.98 or wireless earplugs for less than a pound, Excuse given was maybe the offer had finished but they could do a pump for ??7.68 which isn't ??1.98 so Trust Pilot my review is valid. I'm sure the company as done the best they can but I have still been mislead.",1,28/04/2024
"Am disgusted with the quality and sizes of all the clothes in my order. The quality is awful. The reviews were 5***** so they are obviously made up!! I ordered everything as a sample, as I was looking to order large amounts for my business. I would NEVER recommend to my customers. Complete waste of money.",1,28/04/2024
"The app works great but the customer support is trash! i had to wait 2.5 hours three times! And my finnal answer i got was ""sorry we can not help you, do you have any other questions?'' Very bad!",1,28/04/2024

"Bought a few things from Temu, some good, some bad, some broken. Refund always given. However, since reading the write-ups online about the app and security, I am more than a little concerned. I have removed the app and will not purchase any more until the problem is resolved.Thank you for your reply, however my concern was more to do with security and what information you have access to. Also, I did point out that refunds were given....",3,28/04/2024
"Great. Nice Quality on the clothes. Material matches the description as does the size. Fast shipping, good prices. I'll shop here again",5,28/04/2024
"I've had great experience with Temu. You just need to read the description to understand what your ordering, same as Wish , eBay or Amazon. I'm working on my 10th order now, 9 delivered as of today. I've ordered many items for crafting like jewelry, wooden blanks and  Cricut supplies. I live in Canada so the savings are huge.  Only thing I don't like is the Fishland game. As others have said elsewhere it's a no win game and only gets you friends mad and the sooner Temu realize it the better",5,28/04/2024
"I?€?ve ordered multiple items from Temu in three different deliveries. Items are as described, inexpensive and arrive fairly quickly. My grandsons, 9 and 12, are very fond of the various plastic kits. Motorcycles, ships, transformers etc.Will order again.",4,28/04/2024
I was hesitant after all the reviews but now on order number 4 and no issues. Love my latest order. As a larger chap I was thinking that the clothes would be mega small like on other 'cheap' apps so I went a size bigger and wished I'd gone a size smaller in a top although I do love a baggy top. The shorts are comfy and good quality. Also got other bits and was pleasantly surprised with the quality. Just 1 issue with some sun glasses but was refunded within 3 minutes. The range is incredible. Well done Temu keep it going.,5,28/04/2024
"I initially placed a small order to assess the quality of the items and have since placed more! Im adicted, I love this shopping experience, free shipping with a choice of regular updates of where your parcel is so you can follow it from dispatch to your door. and usually takes a week.

It's a genuine site. With great items. Fast delivery.I use a well know bidding website. Temu offers great value like for like and better quality.,5,29/04/2024
I ordered on the 21st and got my order today every item was in great quality and the service was great but the only problem was that they kept on delaying and was a day over the date idk if they actually give you ??5 after the date they think but i might be complaining just for one day but they delayed for 3 day and 5 days to give updates the updates were pretty slow too. over it was a good experience and would buy again but i have to be honest the customer service doesn?€?t answer your question a lot,4,29/04/2024

"I bought six dresses and all arrived safe and on time. The quality is not great but it does the job. They look nicer on the website than in reality.

"I ordered several items. I ordered a shoe rack for my trainers to keep them off the floor, it is if very poor quality, so please beware of this. I also ordered the black wire bathroom stick-on shelves, in the picture the stick-on supplied is transparent these are gold, not very attractive, and not so bad when you put bathroom items on the shelves as it hides some of the gold, seriously if your advertising something and place an order it should be the same. The other 3 items were okay. Would I recommend this site, definitely not.",1,29/04/2024
"I've ordered now about 10 times, never had an issue.  Every step of the delivery process I have been notified.  As soon as it is delivered, I get an email advising same.  The majority of the products have been amazing, and a fraction of the cost compared to Amazon and even cheaper than Aliexpress.  I had one item that didn't work for me - I clicked on refund for that item, and got a refund within the hour.  No issues what so ever.  I think Temu is great and I will continue to order in the future.",5,29/04/2024

"Great prices for great product. They always provide free shipping. If the order is not delivered in the window it is promised, they give a $5 credit.

Received all my shopped products really impressed with the sizes and quality and time it took to get them.,5,30/04/2024
Can't fault the company.Arrived early in one piece. All the items were as expected. Ive just made another order. A++ service,5,30/04/2024
First time I ordered the customer service were amazing and did accordingly to what I asked. Second time I ordered the items I got were damaged and the clothing items tore after a few days of wearing so I contacted customer service I was in a queue of 90 people waiting 2 plus hours( which I waited for on the app because it would give a prompt every 3 minutes to tap if you did not it would kick you out the line). After waiting the lady was disrespectful made me wait 10 minutes for every reply and at the end did not listen to me and rejected everything I had to say. Hugely disappointed and would never buy again from the app until they sort out my issue. DO NOT BUY FRIM THIS APP A SECOND TIME.,2,30/04/2024
"Ordering from Temu is easy for everyone. The website is very easy to maneuver in.  I have been pleasantly surprised and satisfied at the quality of all the products  I've ordered which is a lot. Delivery has been 99% when estimated, not the fault of Temu, yet they do honour a $5.00 credit if delivered later than anticipated.  Some packaging has been crushed but all my products ordered have been 100% in tact.Telephone customer service is friendly,  helpful, efficient and solves any issues.Above all, the Canadian prices are affordable.I highly recommend  Temu.",5,30/04/2024
"Fantastic experience. Ordered on Sunday 28th. I originally ordered a few items, but you can add on more items 8 hours before it's all packed and shipped which is what I did. It was super easy and simple and it all came in one order.I had a message the next day on my phone confirming my items have been packed and shipped. Tracking was sent with this message and it arrived today in UK. That's 5 days! And the shipping was free! Just bear in mind most things aren't of branded quality, but for the price you can't complain!Will shop again.",5,30/04/2024

"I have used Shein several times and been happy, so I tried Temu.The package is outrageous...Most of the products are either poor quality (far more unlike the pic on the site), smell bad or arrived broken. But to be fair, there were some nice staff but will never go back there, such a waste time&money.5/6 Hi Temu,Thanks for your response. I do appreciate your strict policies and guidelines however, there is no way I can agree with. I had to fix a wooden rack as some nails had fallen off when arrived, the slicer doesn't look the same as the pic and the trousers are way too short than the measurement on the website. I have already applied the return process, with all pictures attached inc. of broken items and sent the return back to you -each with the original package and on top, using a bubble wrapper for fragile items though some had already broken - this is YOUR job, NOT MINE! hence I hope the smooth refund comes through asap.",1,30/04/2024
"I have ordered from Temu several times over the past month.   Only problems I've had was a item was broken, another item was too big.   I repaired the broken item myself and Temu replaced the shoes that were too big... In fact the told me to keep the ones that were too big and give them to a friend.   Most of my orders have arrived within 7 days after I place my order.   I do receive quite a few emails keeping me updated on when my orders will arrive.   As for quality of items so far I have been very pleased.",5,30/04/2024
The products are hit or miss. I ordered & the flimsy plastic bag had a huge hole in it. I didnt get a lot of stuff because of it. Then  I had to deal with thier customer service bot & what a absolutely awful experience. They sent the wrong products & sizes also. It was a nightmare. I CANNOT recommend anyone use them after this experience. What a joke!,1,30/04/2024
"Between Evri who supposed to deliver for temu trying to trace when parcel going to be delivered that was out for delivery tuesday and nothing since, And and trying to contact temu and their chat bot not understanding that need to know if they can help.

"Temu have contacted trustpilot to remove my previous review. I have purchased items on here and have had a real experience. My concerns are that this is unregulated in the fact thousands of sexual products are being sold with no regulation or age verification by sellers using the platform and. Can be dangerous for minors especially considering how cheap they are. I purchased a couple adult products from Temu and was not once was I age verified,  just paid and awaiting shipment. Furthermore none of these products show up on categories. But once you search for adult content...",2,01/05/2024
"You get what you pay for... or actually you don't. I placed an order on May 17, and it was shipped on May 18 and until now NO SHIPMENT received. I checked the tracking number, it showed that the order is out for delivery on May 26 in ANOTHER STATE that is over 300 miles from where I live. I checked the order info and I see all my information is correct and was wondering how did they manage to get my order released to be delivered out in ANOTHER STATE. No update after May 26.I also found out that the shipping company SpeedX is also the main shipper for Shein.com, since Temu uses the same shipper and when you call their customer service number, they mention Shein via an automated message and no one answers, they might be related. Cheap items, cheap shipping, what to expect... Temu does not care if after 15 days you don't receive your items, they'll just send you a refund. Will they hold the shipping company accountable, I don't think so. They are getting Ten's of thousand's of order's every day, one or two shipments getting lost is just not worth the trouble they got lots more profit coming in. So, purchase at your own risk. If you like to gable, Go for it, either way you are loosing more money gambling then winning, this is pretty much the same. The only difference is the back and forth with the customer service that don't even have a clue of where the shipment is or possibly any means to contact the shipper.I was about to place another order, the items are still in the shopping cart and they will stay there. Not worth the headache to go through this nonsense again. Pay a couple of more extra dollars and have it shipped from your country of origin or just get something of better quality that might last longer from another online store or vendor.  Good Luck.",1,01/05/2024
"Nothing to complain about. Easy to order, full tracking details provided and items delivered on time :).  Everything appears to be of good quality and very happy - some items are games, so cannot comment on their longevity, but based on the price, am happy if they are a short-term item.I had after placing the order been told that a number of people thought this was a scam website, but my immediate response was that, if you can pay via PayPal, you're protected, so have no concerns.",5,01/05/2024

"I've made several orders through this Ap and LOVE it.  THe majority of items I've received are wonderful, and the ones that didn't work or were broken were refunded quickly (except for one item that I'm currently waiting to get back to them for my refund which is a bit frustrating waiting with no updates).   My only issues are 1) each order seems to take longer to get here....the first order was REALLY fast, but each subsequent order has taken longer.   and 2) the games are very hard to win, and each time you play, it gets harder.  I've won one game for 2 items (one was broken and had to be returned, thus what I'm waiting on) but I either run out of time or what you get for each referral is less and less.  And I don't know that many people, LOL.  THere is only ONE thing I want, but I'm getting frustrated with them continually raising the bar when I get close. when you start it's like 1% everytime you do something, but toweard the end when you're running out of time it's like .001% for each thing you do....  But overall, I refer this to lots of people through my weekly LIves.....and I'll be ordering more items after my current item is delivered and paid off (AFterpay is wonderful!)",4,01/05/2024

"I went to this website for the very first time today to make a purchase. It said Free delivery on everything so the item I wanted costed ??2.98. I entered my card details and it then said i would not be able to make payment until I had written a reveiw. I went on and then a message came up stating that I would have to bring the total purchase to ??10 for Free delivery. Why was it not possible to state that delivery was Free on purchases of over ??10 at the very outset? How does one write a review on something that they have not had the opportunity to examine and use? I immediately abandoned the website.3rd June, 2023: The fact remains that the Temu website states ""Free Shipping on all orders"" and NOT Free Shipping on orders over ??10. They are misleading buyers and this is unfair. The response from Temu does not resolved this situation.",2,01/05/2024
"I placed my first order and waited for it?€?s delivery. It was being delivered by Evri and two days in a row i received the message that they would deliver it the next working day. Both days this did not happen and then I received no updates after that. Temu did give me ??5 credit as it was past when it was supposed to arrive and they apparently reached out to Evri to see where the parcel was. Most likely Evri had lost my package as they refunded me as Evri would not be able to deliver it. I would have preferred the option of having the order sent out to me again, however Temu automatically refunded me instead. This would have been alright however when i went to add the items back to my basket to reorder (except for 1 item which was out of stock) the total order price DOUBLED. I contacted customer support over this and Alliandro did try to resolve this issue by asking me to place the order again, however as I explained to them, it would have cost me double the amount of money to reorder so I wasn?€?t happy with this resolution. Alliandro offered me a 20% off (up to ??20) discount however, the order still would have been significantly more expensive than my original order, so I also wasn?€?t happy with this resolution. Unfortunately Alliandro was not able to offer any other resolutions, which is understandable as I?€?m sure they don?€?t have much power to resolve this, however it was disappointing.I was looking forward to my first order from Temu, as well as placing future orders (instead of ordering from Aliexpress, since the delivery was supposed to be faster) however after this experience I will not be reordering my original order or placing any future ones. I hope Temu can partner with a more reputable courier in the future as well as fix the process for customers when stuff like this goes wrong in the future. For now though, I will be uninstalling the app.",1,01/05/2024

"I never received my order. It appears to be the same issue for lots of other people too. It should have been delivered by Evri who said they delivered it but provided no photo evidence. It also took a month from when I ordered it to when it was supposed to be delivered. It also said if it's delivered after 26th may I would get an automatic refund of ??5. Unsurprisingly that never happened either!  If it looks too good to be true it probably is. Update. Evri have said the parcel was out in a recycle box (put for collection by the side of the road!!) so that's gone now. Evri told me to contact Temu. I'm 51 in a queue. When I tried to send issue in a message I kep getting an automatic response saying ""please give more info"". I was then supposedly passed for a chat but was 51 in queue and it wouldn't send my message!! I will never order from this company again and will warn others not to. It seems odd that we have Evri parcels delivered all the time in the porch with no issue so it makes me wonder if this parcel never existed. All very weird. Thank goodness for PayPal. They didn't quibble at all I got a response 10 mins later to say they were processing my refund, they clearly know the company!!! Steer clear",1,02/05/2024

"I was very skeptical so started off with a small order. I am so impressed with the range, speed, and pricing that I have made another 4 -5 orders since. The quality may not always be the highest, but it is definitely better than the prices suggest. Currently looking after my grandchildren and having a box of surprises arrive each week for them to open is something they will not soon forget. Sometimes I will review an item with a negative phrase (not what I expected) and they always respond with a query if I would like a refund on it. I have never requested one, but this gives me great confidence in ordering again. The prices are very cheap, the postage is free, and the goods come quickly. The only problem is that there is so much to choose from, it becomes difficult to  stop buying!",5,02/05/2024
Ordered 2 dresses very sceptically BUT highly impressed with the progress emails charting the delivery. The dresses were fine one was too big and when i tried to return was told to donate it or keep it. I received a refund the very same day.Will certainly use again,5,02/05/2024

The quality of the T-shirts is amazing.  I also ordered some dresses and was pleasantly surprised how well made they were. Everything fitted so well. Handbags were top class.

Now today they refund my money and said they can't deliver the order. Also I'll update to see how long it takes to get my money back. Update: items arrived late. Gave me a $5 credit. Money was not refunded back to my card like they promised. They made them as credits, forcing me to buy other items. This is a genuine experience. The fact it was flagged as not is ridiculous and unfair.",1,03/05/2024
"Update -Upon receiving their reply, I contacted them on the email and was told the same thing that their logistics shows it was delivered. The logistics they sent me wasn't of my address that I had and when I mentioned that and that I had called the courier service from the number their app had and theu had verified that to me that it was returned back. I was told that I hadn't made any return request and that it shows as delivered so they can't help me. How will I make a return request for a product never received but returned back to shipper? Additionally, the delievry made in their proof is at the incorrect place even though the address is correctly provided for the order and they are refusing to admit it. I have used temu for a few orders now, it is like wish or aliexpress and had expected that. So products are cheap but so is quality. I only got a few items whose quality didn't matter much so was originally okay with my purchase but on my second and third purchase, my order kept getting dropped at different spot than they were supposed to and 15 mins later I went to pick up from that spot and it would have disappeared. I contacted temu but they don't have an easy way to reach them. You either do a chat which usually says you are in queue and after 15 mins would send a follow up to keep staying in queue or leave and that follow up is active only 30 secs, if you fail to hit keep staying than you lose and have to restart the whole process. And the second is you submit a ticket, which again is not very reliable, they will review your ticket in 24 -48 hours but only give you 5-10 mins to reply back if you don't, you recieve an automated reply about closing your ticket because you didn't respond back. I had to wait for 4-5 hour for the live chat to actually connect and had to keep hitting the keep in line waiting every 15 mins for 4-5 hours which you can understand is how frustrating and then I was refused help.I contacted the company, after a lot of talk, they refunded me for second order but when it happened for third order, I was told they can't refund or resend because their logistics shows it was delivered and a bunch of nonsense basically refusing me to refund my money or resend my order that I never recieved. They told me to call the courier which also I did but the courier they use told me the order was returned back to temu and when I told temu, they kept saying that their logistics show it was delivered and they can't help me.  In addition to their 4-5 hours of wait and constant 15 mins keep in line and then refusal for help, I think this is the worst company to buy from. So if you never get your item, it isn't their fault because they sent it, and they refuse to take responsibility beyond that.",1,03/05/2024
"I honestly thought that this was a scam, and my items would never arrive, but to my amazement, they did, and on time, well happy with my products, and well done Temu, I will be ordering more stuff.. ???? ????",5,03/05/2024
I was so excited about the great items and such exceptional prices. Well if it is too good to be true it probably is. I ordered 4 pair of shoes and two tops. All of the shoes were too large and looked inexpensive. Most if not all items come from China. The good news is shipping was free for the return.  YEAH. But it sure took a long  time to get my credit card refund.  It was as if they were hanging on to my payment. Finally 4 days after they said they had returned my dollars to my credit card account it finally posted   I will not purchase from TEMU again,2,03/05/2024

"I have had mostly quite good luck with this company, but I received three pair of shoes on May 8 which hurt my feet, so I returned them on the 10th and have never received a refund or credit; in fact; the site says I never returned them at all.  Once this happens to me, I just lose all interest in shopping on a site at all.  Really too bad, as I have loved most of the items I purchased, and the prices are very good.  Edited to add:  problem resolved; refund has been issued to me.  Thanks so much, Temu!!",5,04/05/2024
My order arrived quickly and in one piece. Everything was great.,5,04/05/2024
"Doesn't really work out cheap, most items are fakes. Constant app push notifications.",1,04/05/2024
"THE GOOD: Prices are low low low! Free shipping is what originally made me try them. Though I expected the stuff to take forever to arrive & be the same not so great quality as Wish. So far the quality has been better than Wish & my orders have come much faster (10 days w/Temu vs 3 weeks w/Wish). If an item you order is offered for less within 39 days, they will issue a Temu credit for the difference. No need to constantly check pricing, just click a link on your order details page & the app does the searching & calculates the amount automatically. I did receive a blouse that didn't fit & after following the easy refund link process, a credit for the price I paid for the blouse was immediately added to my account. I decided on a credit over refund to my credit card because it was less than $5 & I knew I would be ordering from them again. THE NOT GOOD: I tried their coupons/referral bonus/etc promos but was always just a little short of gaining anything. And that was after bugging friends to join in Temu's reindeer games. Considering how low their prices are, I didn't find it worth the effort. And if you allow notifications &/or text messages, they will send them multiple times a day, like ridiculously too often, so I suggest opting out of notifications & text messages.",4,04/05/2024

I have always been extremely satisfied with the quality and of course the price of each item. Also, Temu.com provides detailed information with each email regarding each order including price, item and the credit card that was used. Most retailers do not provide this information, which leads to having to go into the account to make sure the order is accurate. With Temu.com purchases shipping is always free.

I had no idea they were the number one rated app in the Apple App Store I think everything, they sell is legit and has potential to take over any sales United States make which I believe uses their product and ads or companies logo on there just to of the value. The company is from China. Therefore everyone knows that it is not expensive to purchase product but here in our country the same product just add a Nike logo is $200 more. Eventually, I think shipping will be better ones the world figures it out that their merchandise is worth the money and the weight.",5,04/05/2024
Order never arrived after 3 weeks even though the company promised 7-10 days delivery. Absolute waste of time.

I have a job where I have to leave my phone on, so deleting the app, and stopping notifications was the only option. I still get about 4 to 6 messages a day, but at least they don't wake me, and I just delete them when I see them. DON'T EVER SIGN IN FOR MESSAGES.",1,05/05/2024

"They cancelled two of my orders as because the packages were ?€?lost?€? even though tracking shows it?€?s being processed by customs. Instead of issuing a refund on my credit card, they issued me store credit, and the amount of credit was less than what my credit card was charged. After many attempts, I finally got a real chat agent, whom I pointed out the issues to. The agent still ignored the fact that i wasn?€?t even issued back the full amount and refunded me LESS than what my credit card was initially charged. I could see the pending incorrect amount refunded via my online banking, even though Temu claims it takes 5-14 business days. Totally sketchy company. Will not support or recommend! I?€?ve submitted this as fraudulent transactions to my credit card so I don?€?t need to deal with this company myself anymore. Will be submitting this to BBB too.",1,06/05/2024

This is a shopping app with fake ads for things at prices that are not the same once your in the app. Don't waste your time downloading  this false advertising app.Edit: Your response was also part of the ads. There was no flash sale for the advertised item that was commercialed a few hundred times to me that same day. Yet no flash sale for it at $7. Your company is fraudulent and false.,1,06/05/2024

So far so good!  I wasn?€?t sure about ordering but the prices are so attractive I thought I?€?d take a chance.  Received all items within the timescale specified and all but 1 were satisfactory.  You shouldn?€?t expect really high quality for the prices so I was pleasantly surprised how good the things looked.  I item I had to return and after following instructions the refund was issued as soon as the carrier had received the item.  No complaints from me. I?€?ve made 2 further orders so fingers crossed that they are as good as the first!,5,06/05/2024

All items arrived- pretty good quality for what we?€?re paying to be honest! I was going to place a second order but still wary as so many bad reviews. I may send a little one at my own risk. If I don?€?t receive it then I?€?ll know to not do it again. Overall-with  Temu I?€?ve had a brilliant service start to finish. I understand why everyone is wary, guess it?€?s a chance we take- or don?€?t. Each to their own choice. For now- I?€?m really happy with my purchases!Thanks Temu!! ???€",5,06/05/2024

"Temu - Another scam/poor quality company from china.Luckily, paypal refunded me for the absolutely shocking quality piece of clothing I bought as a ""Test purchase"". Just like I did with wayrates and Aober's multiple subsidiaries.It's your typical printed on piece of polycotton design that has faded and was printed in the lowest possible resolution... The type you see facebook spammers posting up about the dodgy tee shirts with ""I fix stuff"".Now, Based in Ireland at a PO box/virtual office you are not able to hit them with Trading standards UK.

"I happened to find Temu on the internet, placed an order, was extremely happy with speed of delivery & the items I received. In particular the shoes I purchased, size 37 perfect fit & excellent quality, although noticed the price increased immediately I put into my Cart (as did every other pair of shoes, which I did not purchase). One of the items I purchased was a silver shoe trim, assuming there would be two in packet but there was only one. I was happy to purchase more items from Temu & ordered another silver shoe trim, but inadvertently ordered twice, tried to delete one from order but totally impossible no matter what I did as only able to ?€?increase quantity?€? but not ?€?decrease quantity?€?. I stupidly thought perhaps the one I tried to delete would not show up on my invoice but it did. I immediately contacted Customer Service explaining situation, did not receive a response but again stupidly thought perhaps that was because they had seen my attempts to delete & had now done that. Ordered two pairs of slip on gardening shoes size 37 (same size as previous pair) the price of these did not increase when put into the cart. Again order arrived in excellent time. The two pairs of slip on gardening shoes were huge even though size 37 is stamped on bottom of shoes, I will never be able to wear them & know of no one I can give them to. Both pieces of silver shoe jewellery were in the order so it was a waste of time sending my explanation & request to Customer Service to delete one. I have no idea if there was a glitch in the system during my order/request but something clearly was not right. In hindsight I am the one who placed the order therefore responsible for consequences of that. However it is very frustrating when items cannot be deleted, requests to Customer Service ignored & items way off the expected size. Basically two thirds of the cost of my order is down the drain. I have another order waiting to go to Checkout but am very reluctant to take the risk & find I am out of pocket again. On the positive side Temu do have fast delivery & keep you fully informed however, if they fail in other areas, that is of little consequence.",3,07/05/2024
"Customer service is 0 with Temu and deliveries so far 3 out of 4 were late.  For the past 10 says I have been trying to call customer service with no luck. Waited on hold up to 4 hours some days and gave up. I have tryed emailing and no one calles me back. The first few times I called customer service was early May. Now nothing. I feel they help you in the beggining and then you are on your own with a robotic chat that is ?????To speak to customer service thru the chat you are put in line and I was # 124 on the call list.  I waited forever to get to #47 and then was cut-off.  Oh and if you are not by your phone to keep texting yes I'm still waiting, they give you 30 seconds to reply and if you don't they assume you are not there and cut you off. Very frustrating.  I need to return some items and do not have a printer to print off return labels.  Website says you must print return label or they will not except. The first calls I made early May they answered right away. The first returns I had customer service helped me with it no problem. Now? I feel like I'm going to go crazy waiting on hold to get help. What is it going to take to have someone call me? Most of their service employees are not in Canada or USA so I'm not sure what's happened to them but I will not be ordering anymore untill this is resolved.",1,07/05/2024

Parts were not too bent up but the boxes were mangled.I also ordered three of another item, charged for one and did not receive any of them at all.Efforts to navigate the return page failed after uploading photos and wasting a couple of hours of my life.

Not too much of an issue because the order wasn't urgent, but just beware this is not an 'Amazon' next day type service as the goods suffer from transport & customs delays. Overall quite happy and may order other items, if needed.",4,07/05/2024
My experience with Temu and their merchandise and the customer service has been very positive. (For me)?€?My input is a logical one I have order from top department stores. Guess wha!!! I have encountered bad service and bad delivery and damaged merchandise?€?So I have order about 10 orders already and they are perfect for me and the delivery amazing?€?So my take is be aware of you details on items you buying.. Trouble with the delivery we?€?ll call their carrier and deal with that problem?€?I have a three deal rule I give three chances if I have any problems with any merchandise or quality of it?€?it only takes me 3 x times to exclude myself from buying?€?.

It?€?s especially good for things like filling goody bags, party gifts for kids etc. The shipping is free. Same day despatch, arrived within a week. The app and the website are both good and are  an Aladdin?€?s Cave of stuff, well worth checking out.

Which is what I wanted,keep up with fashion.throw away or charity shop by autumn. Done 3 orders now and nothing and I honestly mean nothing is the same as what you see.  It's like wish and shein had a baby. Ta da temu. As soon as my last order comes through,I'm deleting my account and app,therefore wont forget myself one night and order rubbish.This way I can start buying rubbish I don't actually need locally..probably there stuff made in china,but I'd rather keep a small business going than somewhere that turns out tat and makes billions out of it.

"I made a purchase for .83 cents for some cleaning sponges. Not only was my item late but the packaging was terrible. Temu did give me a $5 credit to use for the item being late but, then without notice supposedly they updated the checkout balance having to be over $10 but, I had literally just made a purchase under $10 within the same time frame of trying to use my $5 credit. So, I guess the $5 will just sit in my account or I'm considering deleting my account altogether. Yes, they have cheap items but not worth the hassle just my opinion.",1,08/05/2024

"Helped a friend buy a skirt from Temu. But it turned out to be too small.So when we contact temu they respond that it's not a problem. We just need to download and print a Return Ticket from their Courier Company and return the product for free and they will either give us a credit within a few hours upon receipt of the item or if we want a refund back onto a credit card it'll take a few days.The problem was the courier company was ""having difficulties"" sending through the returns ticket, but it would be fixed in a couple of hours. Two days later and we still couldn't get the Returns Ticket from the courier. Temu only have an automated response to queries and it was useless. Giving us the runaround. No phone number, no real person to talk to.There was an address on the parcel so did a search. Address had a different company listed so I rang them.They've had at least 10 calls in the past fortnight. The address used to be theirs months ago but has been empty since they moved out.So Temu is also using a fake address.  All sounds extremely dodgy to me.Beware of this company. Personally I will never buy anything off them no matter how cheap. Would rather pay a little more to a company I can trust... or at least contact if I have problems.",1,08/05/2024

Tried to order some labels today for ??1.98 to use my credit and when checking out, was informed that I have to make a minimum spend of ??10. I am not about to give them any more money as I am getting suspicious. I go on their customer service chat to ask for the refund to be made in cash or to be allowed to spend the ??1.99 without having to spend another ??8.01 and got nowhere. The chatbot did not have a clue and kept asking me to wait while it checked on my request. My only conclusion is that this is a scam advertising cheap prices on to induce you to part with your money, and then to keep it in their credit account which you can't spend unless you send them more money without ever knowing if they will send you the goods. Good thing I didn't spend more on their site.",1,09/05/2024

"I've had five orders with temu and they have all been satisfactory. I'd admit I was somewhat skeptical, but they proved to be a reliable company.They had free delivery on 20.00 or more and free returns. I have used both those options. Returns are something that make people hesitant to order from sites such as temu. I can say with full confidence that when I had to return two clothing items because they didn't fit, I had zero problems. The returns were free and I had a refund within 5 days. People who have ordered low end items expecting to receive high end product should not order. I've seen the few complaints and it seems that the purchaser is to blame for their dissatisfaction. With such an easy return policy why would you not just return for the quick refund? I will order again in the future.",5,10/05/2024

Everything arrived before expected delivery date, and good tracking info as well and I was really happy with my order, everything actually looked like the photos and the quality was good for the price paid. So I ordered again, this time I had a promotional voucher (get ??30 off if you spend ??100) so I ordered some clothes for summer, some Xmas gifts for family and a few other random bits (that cost 3x as much on amazon) again items arrived before the expected 2 week timescale given, good tracking, nothing missing and good quality for the price. Will definitely be ordering again.However the games are a fix and you do have to get people to join to win and Im not into that.But today in promo gift box I got ??3 off my next order. And the free shipping makes such a difference!I do however find I spend a lot of time looking through products on the site and adding stuff to my basket when I should be doing other things but that isn't their fault, just good products.One point for improvement would be to add a wish list you can categories, separate to the basket, as at the moment my basket has soooooo many items in it makes it difficult to find what I'm looking to actually buy on that particular order, but again won't mark down for this, but it would make shopping easier.",5,10/05/2024
"It?€?s a fun shopping app and the prices are very low and I really like the free shipping. I?€?ve received everything I?€?ve ordered. Some things take longer to receive and I?€?ve forgotten that I ordered something, so when the package arrives, it?€?s a mystery what I?€?m receiving because I forgot what I ordered. Some items didn?€?t work or arrived broken, however they are quick to make it right by offering a refund or a credit. They send a lot of text messages. However if that is an issue, one can always silence notifications from them, so their messages won?€?t interrupt sleep or meetings. The discounts and offers for free items are appreciated.",4,10/05/2024
Great Quality Highly recommend and affordable and games are a bonus. Tell your friends and family,5,10/05/2024
"I have had about 4 orders of stuff and have had no problems what so ever, I was a bit surprised by the negitive feed back to be honest! I even sent an item back as it was to large for what I was after, and that was hassle free.. All the items I have ordered I am happy with.  I have told my friends even how good this site is...",5,10/05/2024
Have order several items very happy with purchasing alll good fit excellent price,5,10/05/2024
"The package doesn?€?t have any bubble wrap and delicate items like earrings are not separated into little boxes(mine all came with the posts bent). Everything is packed in bags, in flimsy plastic mailer, and scotched taped. It?€?s hit or miss with items. They do tend to make things look like you are getting bigger items. Don?€?t be surprised if things come not in the exact color you asked. That happens a lot.",2,10/05/2024
"Good prices , good stuff, will buy ogain",4,10/05/2024
not a scam!!i received all my items on time for the chip prices don't hope to receive a very good guality but that is enough to get out of trouble .,5,10/05/2024
I have been very pleased with the service and items that I have purchased from Temu.  However I see now they are selling glass pipes.  I feel this might be something that should not be sold or marketed on a site like this.,3,10/05/2024
"I've placed 3 orders with Temu so far, and am thrilled with everything,  the quality and cost is UNBELIEVABLE,  It saddens me to read the negative reviews because that's so far from the truth I've ever heard. Each order I received my items within 2 weeks, the owner is a genius,  he or she makes money and definitely gives the customer a big cost break, now days that just doesn't happen, everyone wants more and more money for everything.  I've never bought such beautiful p.j's for 8.00, or shoes for 5.00 in years, I honestly don't know how they can afford to charge us so low, that's a business owner that really wants to help their customers.  I bought a microwave magnet a year ago for 12.00 at walmart, I just saw the exact one on Temu for 5.00, I'm telling everyone about them, I'm thrilled to give that a great review! Thank you Temu for giving your clients such a low cost and not being greedy like most companies,  I will be with u forever, and am so sorry for the negative reviews you certainly don't deserve those low ratings. Barbara",5,10/05/2024
It is a really good app it is Cheap and the stuff is good and if it is not good you get your money back,5,10/05/2024
Happy with the craft items and other bits and pieces.  good value.  DID NOT APPRECIATE TWO PHONE CALLS IN MIDDLE OF NIGHT.  AUTOMATED CALLS SAYING PARCELS ON THE WAY AT 4.00 am.  VERY WORRYING AS I AM DISABLED!!!,4,10/05/2024
"Firstly, you can save 100 friends and you won't get anything, secondly, they have access to all your data, e.g. fb bank account and everything, Thirdly, order something and after how long they will steal your bank account!! scammers and thieves",1,10/05/2024
Let me save you time and money the material on their products are so bad and cheaply made Dont waste your money with this app go to dhgate pay a little more and get quality they use polyester for all their products wish make them shiny and cheap looking save  your money and buy quality this app is not environmental friendly everything will end up in a damp one day I repeat Dont buy this rubbish safe your money,1,10/05/2024
"To be very honest, I was very pleased with the products I ordered. Im disappointed to see the other reviews on them scamming people etc. This is a true company. I don?€?t play the games that they?€?ve got on there, because I know I won?€?t get far. It?€?s not a scam. They haven?€?t taken any money off you. People need to read the descriptions correctly. The website states how long delivery will take. Mine came 2 days before the delivery deadline. I was updated with when and where my packages were and when they were out for delivery. People forget that these products to come from China and that the products are flown over by the Yodel Currier.",5,10/05/2024
"Ordered 6 items and 5 were excellent value 1 looked good but arrived not working, delivery was very good and arrived 3 days early, Item that was not working will be sent back as returns are free, bye the way the non working item only cost ??1.09 so no problems, if I wished to put the other items on ebay I would easily double my money, however they are all items that I wanted.",5,11/05/2024
"I was kept informed about my order on a regular basis and it arrived within its 3 day window. All of the items were in stock and as shown/described in their advertising. The prices are excellent, so there's nothing to not like. I'm a satisfied customer and happy to recommend Temu to other shoppers.",5,11/05/2024
"Quite surprised at some of the reviews. Everything I've bought has had better quality than expected, delivery was actually a few days earlier than expected. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is because they're mini games are obviously a very predetermined coding trying to get customers to bring in new people.",4,11/05/2024
I honestly dont know why anyone is putting negative comments i did the sharing it about and won free items my items have come fast delivery lovely quality the material is brilliant not cheap thin stuff honestly could not fault at all my son got the little portable printer and hes obsessed just takes photos and prints he can draw or write anything on his phone and it prints instantly so easy to use would definitely recommend temu,5,11/05/2024
"I've never had a problem. Items are o of expected quality, arrived within 2 weeks and the prices and variety are great.  I shop there often",5,11/05/2024
"Ordered a number of items, mainly to see what they were like and the type of service I would receive and can only say both are brilliant.  The clothes are good quality and beautifully packed and the cutting dies are such good value.  I will definitely purchase again",5,11/05/2024
"Saw this ad while watching a video on YouTube. I was skeptical at first but seen the low prices and free delivery, I thought why not give it a try. I ordered 6 items who arrived within a week. Everything was just like the picture. I was happy with all my items. It's been three weeks now and everything still looks great. I didn't buy any electrical items.",5,11/05/2024
"Worst place to shop, part order sent for refund 3 weeks ago, still no airing for goods to be delivered back to supplier. Do t wast your money and time. Poor quality goods, worst customer service ever, long wait and at the end they are unable to help",1,11/05/2024
"Made an order a week and a half ago, received most of it through Royal Mail yesterday, the other half has been delivered to my local ParcelShop by Evri and I will be collecting today. The items that I?€?ve received so far have been great quality. When you?€?re paying 0.50p-??3 for items I don?€?t expect them to be elite, but so far they do what they say on the tin. I?€?ve had a mix of electrical items and normal items and the electric items all work perfectly. I was a bit skeptic so at first but thought I?€?d take the risk. I made three orders, ??20, ??30 and ??20. The ??30 one was actually a ??50 order but the ??20 off coupon made it ??30, so I basically got two free handbags. Clothes are good quality, bag I received is sterdy and perfect size, and the make up isn?€?t salon style but it does for the budget I?€?m on. Only thing I will say is that even though I?€?ve been getting tracking from the get go which is fantastic by the way, my Temu account is telling me Evri will contact me as I have a late delivery, but Evri is saying it?€?s at the ParcelShop so something has gone wrong along the line somewhere?€? I guess I?€?ll update this when I?€?ve popped to the shop in a couple hours to see if it is actually there. All in all, I?€?m so impressed and already have another ??80 order in the bag ready to make via Clearpay. Thank you ??????",5,11/05/2024
"Annoyed with some of the negative reviews - TEMU is a company not a charity - I say this all the time ?€?you only get what you pay for?€?. All of my order was as expected, on time and tracking info was spot on - I think if you?€?re trying to get loads of free stuff or large incentives you?€?re on the wrong track!!   Just remember to research what you?€?re buying!!!",5,11/05/2024
Best shopping site ordered many times never have any problems,5,11/05/2024
"Really like the quality of the products, the website experience, delivery times and their customer service. There was just one instance in which the product received had a few scratches, but they happily refunded the amount almost instantly. They have a great assortment of products relating to daily household work, DIY and accessories. Way to go!",5,11/05/2024
All.iteks delivered on time and as described great experience for us and we were worried after reDi g other reviews,5,11/05/2024
Fantastic from price to quality of products to speedy delivery how can they make any money ?????€??????? All 100% would use again !Edit to my last review the trainers lasted a couple of days of wearing before they started to peel on the bases yep cheap toot as I thought initially,5,11/05/2024
"Easy to order the product, payment process was easy, order status was updated regularly and goods arrived faster than I expected. I would use TEMU again.",5,11/05/2024
Absolutely delighted with my purchases fabulous prices quality items and fast delivery thank you Temu,5,11/05/2024
"Was rather sceptical before placing the order but I was wrong. Received  ??20 off my first order and ordered some handbags and they got delivered in few days and really happy with the whole shopping experience and the products!!! Will definitely shop again, thanks Temu????",5,11/05/2024
"Delivered 3 productsc kitchen strainer, bathtub strainer and children's stickersI threw the strainers out the quality was sooo poor, the metal was so thin I could bend it with two fingers, yeah it might work but it looked like something bought in a toy store, quality is extremely poor , worst ever and I'm not fussyThe children stickers were reasonable, not amazing but not poor. I'd say buy what you're willing to lose as you can't garantee quality",1,12/05/2024
"Ordered twice already and will order again arrived by time they say, and give you regular updates on parcel, great prices and good company to order from",4,12/05/2024

"Every item arrived, came in 3 separate orders, each tracked every single step  of the way to the point of ne going ""not another bleeping text"" lol but fantastic communication. Everything was as described, even better than expected. Was posted with 2 to 3 days of ordering ( this was a large order so that itself was immoressive) all in all would highly recommend and have already ordered other items. *****",5,12/05/2024
No worries about ordering.   Order came promptly to Northern Ireland.  Well packaged.  Good prices and will certainly order again.,5,12/05/2024
"I placed an order for a smartwatch (at the time the reviews were good). It was delayed, so they gave me a ??5 credit. Then they cancelled my order, but, instead of refunding my money, put it as a credit on my account. My emails asking for my money back were seemingly ignored. I was about to raise a dispute with PayPal when the money was repaid in full. I would have given a higher rating if I had been kept informed.",3,12/05/2024
"I have ordered multiple orders from temu. Have never had any issues with their products or their delivery. The delivery on one of my orders got lost in their system , they automatically asked if I wanted a credit or a refund. I chose credit.I have also never been charged with delivery. The items u order most are very inexpensive and u can't expect something that's a couple dollars to be high end.lol. I love Temu.",5,12/05/2024
This is a totally legit site and all the things I ordered came within the stated time and were exactly as described. No problems whatsoever.,5,12/05/2024
I have tried multiple methods and multiple times to contact Temu. I have spent over 5 hours waiting on hold on a phone call and around 4 hours waiting on their Chat line. Nothing has been successful. I completed all the requirements of a Promotion including have additional people sign up but they did not provide the promised promo. VERY shady business - make promises and then do not keep them.I had already ordered twice from them but I will not order again - They are not reputable at all.,1,12/05/2024
"As a NZer temu has only recently become available in nz. Before that aliexpress was what most kiwis used to buy cheap stuff from china.  I like that with temu the shipping is fast and free if you spend $30. They have a guarantee that you get 5$ credit if it is late.  My orders have all arrived early so far so have not had a chance to test thatOf the products i have ordered and received  so far the quality is on a par maybe a little better than aliexpress.  What I like is that everything is shipped together and is so fast, i suspect their service model is to have all products at a central distribution centre so that shipping is combined and consistent and they must have some sort of deal with dhl. And maybe that is also why the quality is a little better than aliexpress as thereis probably some sort of pressure on individual supplier's if they have to send goods to a centralised distribution warehouse to ensure they are fit for purpose.So far I have purchased some couch covers which i have wanted for ages for my caravan but not seen anywhere else, plus some float valves which needed a converter to convert from 10mm to fit my taps so not used yet, and some tape which was as described and works well.Everything I have ordered has arrived and has been of acceptable quality so I cant comment on the return or disputes process. Should I need to in future i will post again.",5,12/05/2024
Excellent quality at an excellent price. I will be shopping there again. Very happy.,5,12/05/2024
Order arrived this morning everything fits perfectly. Quality isn't great but u get what ya pay for. Can't complain at all!!,5,12/05/2024
"Poor customer serviceI placed an order with a wrong postcode it's my fault fine the address was correct but the postcode was not correct where was a mistake on an alphabet I quickly contacted them to rectify the problem (this was just before shipment) they didn't reply me and they kept sending me mail concerning discount offers. My order was to be delivered to me yesterday but it was sent to the wrong address which is the postcode and the worst part is it's the same street as mine the postcode I mistakely typed does not even exist it's a garage, so I contacted the delivery agency and they told me to contact TUMU because they are the ones that have business with them, yesterday I contacted them I sent them an email explaining everything and up till now I haven't got a response it's just bad, this is my first time ordering from them and might be the last time.",1,12/05/2024
Fantastic everything came.Its exactly what i ordered and everything is the same as the pictures( some times thing go wrong). Very very happy with my purchase. I was a bit worries because of the reviews but this is great.  Definitely order again,5,12/05/2024
Temu is perfect you get what you order its amazing and the shipping is perfect very very proud thanks Temu ????????????,5,12/05/2024
"1st time uk buyer everything came a day early and I received all my items which I was happy about I usually don't use sites that I think are bogus but a friend that I trust recommended it and I confirm it's legit it would have been 5 stars if the quality was better its giving thrift store for stuff and things some things will be of good quality and near to decadence others not so much overall good site for keepsakes, quick gifts and trinkets. One more thing... they should offer more sizes for wrist watches seems to be one size only but it can be adjusted you would just have to go get it done at a jewelry store if you don't know how to do it or YouTube if you wanna save money.",4,12/05/2024
The items I?€?ve bought are of good quality items are as advertised  so happy,4,12/05/2024
Looks great! Items came on time and are ok quality.,5,12/05/2024
I had doubts at first but I now have purchased over 50 items at incredible prices and free shipping. Can?€?t go wrong.,5,12/05/2024
Horrible company.  I entered my address correctly and somehow a different city was entered...despite the zip code that was entered correctly.  It's a full on scam don't use it.,1,12/05/2024
I called 3 times for a total of over 5 hours on hold just to try to get a customer service person to get a return label.  I never got through. Now I have to try again tomorrow Bad customer service.,1,12/05/2024
"What a great company! Free delivery, free returns, what's not to like? I've ordered dresses,sandals, make up brushes, beauty bits etc, all perfect! You get what is exactly stated on the website! Delivery details are emailed daily to tell you when you're package arrives, I can't fault it, definitely recommend 100%. Love a bargain!!! ????",5,13/05/2024
I have unfortunately used their service to within a few deliveries I have been charged a delivery charge because I have to pick it up at a post office. Lies about no delivery charge. These are items that could be left not large items.,1,13/05/2024
Awful. Ordered several shoes. All different sizes arrived and not the size I ordered. Sent back a load of items and almost two weeks later not received my refund. Returns can only be sent via yodel and not any choice. Won?€?t be ordering again.  Will stick to Shein. Full refunds within a few days and always send correct size. AVOID. Will be opening a case with PayPal to get my money back,1,13/05/2024
"I have mixed opinions. I have had 3 parcels so far and they all look like they've been thrown around. 1 make up product was damaged, the rest were in boxes that were damaged. The clothes are OK for the price, but nothing special. My delivery today included a DIY model. Whilst the model is good quality, again it was in a box so damaged the parts fell out the bottom. If you wanted to give as a gift you wouldn't be able to. There's no point returning it, as it would likely be damaged as they don't use boxes. So I would rather pay more from another outlet for an undamaged item. TEMU...Please use boxes to stop the damage, and stop using the plastic that's not recyclable.",2,13/05/2024
"Ordered even after being told bot to by a couple people! It was cheap, affordable prices! The size was true to fit! The delivery was way faster than i thought it would be! The only thing wrong was i ordered a 60 pc set of nose rings and it came with 40 and 20 empty holes! I jus ordered my 2nd order tho!",5,13/05/2024

Amazing I love,5,13/05/2024
Your online NZ/AUD sizing chart does not reflect the actual size you receive which is way smaller than ordered based on the chart.  This is very misleading and annoying.  Makes it impossible to use your service ever again.,1,13/05/2024
I have shopped on Temu for over six months and have absolutely no complaints. Most of the customer complaints are because they didn't read the description or size! I had one complaint and they gave me a $25 credit. Everything I have received has been just fine. Their tracking info is very thorough and derailed. I always receive my stuff in a couple of weeks.,5,13/05/2024
"I love the app and I love how we are rewarded with free gifts. Never had a bad experience with them at all and I do understand that people aren't perfect, mistakes does happens. I've never paid a dime for anything just share app for new users. Can't complain about anything you are receiving for free",5,13/05/2024
"They have a great selection of things, from clothing to kitchen items to pet accessories. I have ordered from them several times. The shipping time is good. Sometimes the clothing is spot on, and sometimes it?€?s a little different, however you can return it with never a problem and they pay the shipping cost to return, and my credit card was refunded within a week! Great experience!",5,13/05/2024

"Scam all the way told my order was delayed, then what I ordered was so cheap they had nothing left in stock sent me a stupid gift as compensation but would not give money back as the sent something I did not order orwant ????",5,13/05/2024
I like the website but they are blowing me up with emails.,3,13/05/2024
"Well this is a difficult one, I got sent a link where when I download the app I would receive 20 pounds! I never got this, so I started on the games, im 1 point away and ive invited all my friends and still you don't give me, so on that basis I believe it is a con to scam people! Which is a shame as their is pros about this shopping website, but for now I will stick with shein as its a company I can trust.",3,13/05/2024
"I have order more times than I can remember in the past 4 months!  I was very skeptical at first because of their extremely cheap prices on most of their stuff. But, I?€?m amazed by the quality of the things I have bought!  There have only been a few items that were not what I expected, but I had not spent anything for them hardly anyway, so it was no loss.  I Love, Love, their men?€?s & women?€?s t-shirts/shirts?€????. Great Quality?€????. And feel fantastic?€????. I?€?ve also bought their leggings. They won?€?t disappoint!  I?€?ve bought so many things that were less than $1.75 down to .38 cents & most things are really nice!  They deliver in the time frame they set.  This will be the only time I will have to return anything, so I?€?m not sure how that works.  But I completely Trust them!  I don?€?t want to return the items, I need to exchange some leggings for a few sizes smaller.  Can?€?t wait to get them back!  They feel great & are of good quality.",4,13/05/2024
"First time I orderd from TEMU. I ordered on may 15 , parcel deliverd on may 20!! Wow that is so fast, well pakaged, happy with the items. Will be buying again here. Thank you!",5,13/05/2024
TEMU is an international SCAMNo product was delivered to me or my neighbour as claimed by the delivery company.No one called me about the delivery so i wonder why they delivered my goods to my neighbour when i was at home at the time of delivery quoted by the delivery ageny.summarily TEMU IS A SCAM!!!!!DON'T PUT YOUR MONEY THEREA follow up on the above postTEMU responded to my post and made adequate effort to correct the misunderstanding between it and the delivery agent. Eventually the package was delivered which showed that the delivery agent was responsible for the initial mix up and every effort to get in contact with the delivery agent proved abortive during the course of the mix up. Thank you TEMU for making sure you redeemed yourself from the delivery agents unprofessional way it handled the package.Now i can see TEMU can be trusted as against my initial perspective. Thank you!,1,13/05/2024
"Very impressed with this company. The goods are great quality for the price, shipping is fast and communications are good.I will use them again without hesitation, highly recommended.",5,13/05/2024
"It's a better Wish. I find it decent. Good for buying small things like crafts/sewing supplies. Semi decent return policy. It has a better system for clothing selection than Wish and much better filters.1. Good shipping/delivery, usually within time frame given or else they'll give you $5 credit!2. Returns are free for the order's FIRST return, so please check all your items and pack returns in one return. Within 90 days.3. You can check your order for price adjustments, even when processing and after received. It'll count towards your credit.4. Most items I received so far (I am guilty, I bought like ten different orders already) are actually decent. Always read reviews first. Have returned four items out of forty items received.5. Cons: the free gifts are a referral system. Sorry if you run out of friends.",4,13/05/2024
"Hi guys,I am totally smitten by Temu ????I have ordered many times and I have received all my items and I have Loved ???? every one of them.Always packed great and they arrive within, up to 14 working days to Australia.Temu offer free items and lavishly slashed priced items every day.I can't stay away, I have to look many times a day and save items I would like to buy when I have money.By the looks of it, I will be forever buying on Temu as my cart is always full ????Don't listen to the bad reviews, I am not sure what they see or do to write them but each to their own.I LOVE SHOPPING ON TEMU ????Thank You ????I have been buying now for around 3 to 4 months.",5,13/05/2024

"Ordered from Temu for the first time on May 14, 2023 and today went to check my order and its status.  Found my order page blank.  Nothing.  Zip.  Checked at PayPal and saw my payment had been made and taken by Temu.  Contacted Temu to ask what is going on.  Was given all sorts of excuses that made no sense as to why my orders do not appear on my order page and yet payment was taken.  One of the excuses Temu provided me with was an email address that was not mine and asked me if maybe someone else had used that address to place the order and may appear on that person?€?s order page. Made no sense. I placed the order using my email address and using my credit card.   All my other info was correct but yet some false email address was used and that is why I have no order listed and yet my money is taken?  This is a scam.  They list cheap prices because their items are cheaply made and to hook people into purchasing their cheap items. And then they take the money and do not ship the cheap items.  They are running a scam.  I guess they think that operating out of China they are untouchable by both U.S. enforcing agencies and the public that they scam.  I paid them by PayPal and have filed a claim for a refund.  Additionally, I will be filing a claim with the BBB.  They will not remain untouchable as they think they are if people keep getting a refund and those U.S. credit agencies stop doing business with Temu. If you have an issue with Temu I strongly recommend contacting your credit card company and requesting a refund.  And file a complaint with the BBB and leave reviews for other people to avoid Temu.",1,14/05/2024

Took over 8 hours of my time between a Wednesday till Monday - they used EVRI as a carrier - that?€?s also part of the problem",1,14/05/2024
"If YOU do your due diligence, you can get good deals on items from TEMU. Read the reviews. Read the sizes. Read everything there is to read for each item. If you do order after all that and something is wrong then send it back! Their expense. Simple as that. I have ordered three times. Out of approximately 180 items, I have been happy with 172 of them. Got my money back on the rest. Just be CAREFUL! Do your part of it and make your decisions.",4,14/05/2024
Don't bother referring any one to get your free gifts as you can never get it. As they keep making excuses up. So that you don't get it. And if you buy anything they send it in a bag. I have had so many items that have nearly been damaged becous eof this. Better to go to wish and buy from there,1,14/05/2024
"If you like to pay for garbage GO! Low prices for cheap stuff that you will put in your trash can upon receipt. I ordered reading glasses that were so warped I could not put in my face, a plastic cube puzzle that arrived broken, a metal back scratcher that leaves scratches on your back because of sharp edges and a pad for scouring pans that was in fact sandpaper sticked to foam with a handle. Arrived late so they offered me $5 off on my next purchase, anybody wants it?",1,14/05/2024
My first purchases from Temu and impressed by the service and delivery.  Goods are quality for the prices paid too.  Four stars at the moment as it?€?s my first review. But keep watching?€?.. I?€?ll be back!,4,14/05/2024
"Absolute bs con.  Got one of those recommendations from someone where I download the app.  It's impossible to actually get the free gift they flash in front of you.  Mine said buy 5 and get 3 free, good offer.  Trying to do it though you just go round in circles and every road leads back to getting someone else to subscribe.   The stuff on there looks the same as Ali express and similar sites.  Hit and miss if you get what you see in the picture.  Buyer beware!",1,14/05/2024
"Received all the products I ordered , I got a lot from referrals but only paid the excess which I went over . The quality is ok it?€?s not nasty and cheap but it?€?s not what you get from the other department stores , just like SHEIN and primark quality  . I suppose you pay for what you get so you can?€?t grumble . The sizing is very accurate . I?€?ve got two more parcels on the way from referrals . I?€?m happy with what I?€?ve received. I?€?ve got two more orders to come now .",4,14/05/2024
"I recently came across this company and although I have been caught out in the past with companies that show lovely looking clothes and then come and are flimsy, badly made, too small or nothing liked they looked like in the picture, this was the opposite. I ordered 12 items thinking they would all be going back.  Instead they were all gorgeous. They all fitted and were great quality.  Only one item was a bit small but at ??6.90 I?€?ve kept it for my sister who I know it will look great on.   Thank you and I?€?ve ordered another three orders and imagine will be just as happy.  The prices are incredible and the delivery is about a week but it?€?s well worth looking at.",5,14/05/2024

"I LOVE TEMU?€?. Yes the first time I ordered from temu I was very scared! I had seen a video on someone getting something free and I was like hey I love free stuff! I received my first order in the beginning of May and let me tell you was I surprised! Not only did everything come that was included in my order but it arrived the day it was supposed to! My friends and family aren?€?t really fans of temu but I love it. I have placed about 17 orders now and guess what everything is FREE! That?€?s the beauty of it all is most of the things you can get are free if you play the little games they have! Now are you taking a chance full disclosure yes! Now even though there maybe a picture of something big, don?€?t be surprised if it comes in way smaller than the image itself! That?€?s just the risk you gotta take with apps like temu! But all and all I truly do love this app! Also quick little fyi* don?€?t listen to any of the trolls that say temu is a bad app! It is a really good app and on top of that it?€?s literally the doupe version of shein and you better believe all those trolls stay on shein! But again just make sure you do your research before purchasing anything from this website, in fact from any website in general!",5,14/05/2024
"Just saying if you share you can get free gifts,tired of sharing and not getting any gift?Be I am receiving every I order was please with most stuff so stuff was very small.All I'm saying it you need to in prove on saying if you get one more gift you win but it really doesn't work that way.It just may you think you are getting ready gifts",1,14/05/2024
I made a order with Temu and somehow it got lost with delivery so I guess it's my fault so I am out a package and I'm out $23.04 and I'm very highly mad upset you know I spend a lot of money with y'all I can't believe you're not going to make it right you don't believe a very good customer and I have friends other customers and if you don't make it right you're going to lose a lot of business.thanks.,1,14/05/2024
it is a great app for cheap priced products. I've shopped here about 2 times and haven't had a problem. The only downside is the gifts you can get for credit by sending people the link to sign up it doesn't work very well. But I find its a good experience without those credits.,4,14/05/2024
I purchased some solar lights delivered before timebut one didn?€?t work . They refunded for the faulty one strieght away . The delivery was better than i expectedthat good i recorded some more .now i know it?€?s a good place to deal with i will be ordering again from them.Keep up the good work temp and keep the prices down.many thanks Terry,5,15/05/2024
I wandered what Temu was all about when friend requested to join was very sceptical  at first and did think quality would be shoddy but was pleasantly surprised up to now all goods have been great quality  considering the prices and the free items were good qaulity too  shipped in less then a week and free shipping. Read reviews of some unhappy customers  all I can write My experience  whether been luckily  time will tell as I?€?ve ordered again at the moment happy with delivery time qaulity,5,15/05/2024
"Was cautious about ordering but bit the bullet.  Ordered some men's T-shirts, a couple of women's tops. a couple of rain ponchos and a bag.  Agreed delivery date was between 16-19th May and arrived on 19th by Royal Mail.  All matched their description.  Men's T's were of good quality for the price.  Women's tops were also nice quality for the price, sizing bit hit and miss - ordered XL and ordered according to the size chart - both fit but one fits better than the other.  Bag was decent quality but bigger than I expected but maybe that's my fault for not checking size properly but again reasonable quality for the price paid.I'd be cautious of buying any electrical products as they won't necessarily comply with British Standards.Did have an issue with tracking number as I had 2, was able to contact the company via a live chat.  Very pleasant and helpful but couldn't actually answer the question as to why I had 2 tracking numbers.So my first experience has been positive.",4,15/05/2024
"Ordered some items. About ??30 worth. Arrived quicker than I imagined it would! A few bits of household tat. Set of 3 plant pots, All good. Fake ivy is lovely. Bag for bags does the job. Cooking oil sprayer is very good for ??1.19!! My only issue was a very nice t-shirt I bought in a L. I am a 12/14 and it looked like it was sprayed on. Oh well. I started a return on this item and have recieved a refund. I have not had to return the item either. All done on line. Very easy. My hubby bought a lazer level for buttons and it is surprisingly good. Can't complain about anything. Would definitely use them again, just probably not for clothes.",5,15/05/2024
"Ordered almost 65pounds worth of items. Almost all of the items were damaged, missing parts or different than the description provided. Contacted customer service to settle it and I was kept waiting for 3+ hours on multiple occasions and it still didn't get solved. They're not willing to give a redelivery even with items that I really want and the refund is not promised either and I have been told to wait for almost 2 months to see if I can get a refund and then I can order again. Value for money is so bad, customer service is literally non existent and even though some delays are expected with a cheap service, but this website is outrageously scamming me. 65 pounds down the drain here. Would never recommend anyone.",1,15/05/2024
"First time to order from temu , the item was sent to me a week and the clothes were very nice and good.my daughter loves her dress and shoes so much. Thank",5,15/05/2024
Cheap items delivered to day.  I got exactly what I paid for.,5,15/05/2024
"Not an honourable company. I had a partial shipment and for the items not delivered, Temu sent me multiple emails and texts telling me that they refunded my order BUT will still send the item. BS, its been 3 months and they still haven't sent anything. CS is very difficult to deal with. As long as you know up front that its cheap crap and the company cant be trusted.....",1,15/05/2024
"I placed a order and was sceptical, the order was split into 2, the first order was early but the second a day late.As good as their word they discounted ??5 back into my account.I was pleasantly surprised with the items, I had thought the quality wouldn?€?t be fantastic with the prices but they are all okay.I will be ordering again.",5,15/05/2024
For anyone who says temu are crap or a scam etc it's a lie. I was a bit worried about ordering at first. But I did. I ordered first time received my ten items. 5 of which were free. They were very nice items. So I ordered four more times. And I received all of my parcels apart from one because evri didnt deliver it. Was nothing to do with temu was evris fault and temu refunded me within 3 days. The money is now in my account. The clothes are well made. The items are very nice. They are well worth the money. I am very happy with their products and service and I will continue to order from them....,5,16/05/2024
"They have lots of promos guaranteeing you free items if you refer your friends, but when I actually reffered a friend she wasn't able to accept my invitation as she got a message that my account has 'Suspicious Activity'!!!They just want you to do the marketing for them but they pull tricks on you to avoid their promises!!Also, don't expect any customer service:The online chat isn't a chat at all, instead they ask you to open a ticket! I opened my ticket a week ago, but no processing has even begun and obviously no response from them!!No other options to contact them!!!UPDATE:Their response below isn't worth much, as my ticket was finally (but poorly) handled and I received a response that they can't do anything about the referral issue as their system does it automatically and they can't change anything!Obviously their response below is just their 'dry' & official version of pretending to actually care about the customer... What a shame!",1,16/05/2024
very pleased with the shoe's i received.they are good quality and price is amazing.I am waiting for more items to arrive the delivery service is great.,5,16/05/2024
Ok so I had ordered three of the same items because they not legal to buy here and it was buy 2 get one free and they charged me for all three so I complained and what did they do? They refunded me the entire amount for all three and they arrive tomorrow. I guess I can say issue resolved. I had explained the situation to them several times and said I just needed to be refunded for one,2,16/05/2024
Where do I start...with the positive !!!  The order was delivered and was as stated. END of positive . I spent just over ?? 10 and it must have cost almost that  with the repeated calls to my landline . This morning at 6.30AM.....Last night there was also a call and all this just to tell me the item had been delivered. Last Friday 4.24 AM and another just after midnight To inform me that my order had been processed. I am 70 years old and DO NOT APPRECIATE CALLS TO MY HOME AT THOSE TIMES...IT IS RIDICULOUS AND I WILL NEVER EVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN. Please remove all my details from your data base. There is no need to be phoning people throughout the night especially as you ALSO sent me emails saying the exact same thing............,1,16/05/2024
"I have now made 3 orders from this company. I'm ordering things that are a third of the price on amazon.Just be careful and read the descriptions and measurements as I have ordered something that was smaller than I expected - that was totally my own fault.The clothing I ordered was true to size and I've no complaints.I'm beginning to think that the negative reviews are from disgruntled retailers who are charging over inflated prices. My best buys are the hair accessories and costume jewelry, I compared prices and it averages around a third of what I usually pay plus you get some really good money off offers.You are kept up to date on your delivery but I can also see why some people would get annoyed at this.4/5.",4,16/05/2024
"Recently received 6 items from them. 4 very good and 2 not so much. Kept receiving invites from friends with ""free gift invites"". These are a con. Neither me or my friends no mater how many invites u send have ""free"" items. Just wish they'd stop advertising lies.",3,16/05/2024

I?€?ve just put in a larger order today (19/05/23) costing ??59.59 already had updates! Not an issue at all it?€?s NOT a scam it?€?s just being aware of certain sellers the same as Wish, Ali Express and SaraMart and Even Tiktok  it?€?s the sellers and some offers that are too good to be true that you?€?ve got to be careful of. Know your stuff and it?€?s safe, if you read the terms and conditions within the app payments are protected but if unsure you do not have to input bank details advice is to use Apple pay or Google pay. The free stuff isn?€?t a scam it?€?s just difficult because not everyone wants to join and you don?€?t know if your free gift is coming from a rated seller or not.",5,16/05/2024
This is my third time buying from them. Was skeptical at first but you?€?ve got to try it to believe whether it be positive or negative comments. T-shirts I bought are all good quality and comfy (and we usually buy Ralph Lauren?€?s). Yoga pants of $11 is a lot nicer and stretchier than cheap Kmarts or targets leggings with pockets. All other gadgets I bought are usable (e.g chair legs pads were only less than $2 for 4 piece and fit perfectly in my chair legs compared to many other stuffs I tried) and their refund policy is the best by far. You get instant credit without having to even return the product! So you get to keep them pretty much for free. And I don?€?t believe the reviews were fake.,5,16/05/2024
"We were happy with most of the items we purchased,  however we have serious concerns about the plastic dog chews. They are hard plastic which break off easily.

"Contacted Temu?€?s beyond garbage support several times to make sure my order is good to go. Was assured through the phone call several times that my order will not be canceled.Guess what happened? Order was still canceled. I?€?m convinced that temu is a scam site that just steals your data. Support is virtually non existent.Edit:I have replied back to you through email, let?€?s see if communication is still nonexistent.Edit 2:One day later and I?€?ve yet to receive a response back after sending an email to the email address provided. Instead temu has taken the liberty of flagging this review as being false, and is trying to have it removed. The fact that Temu tries to scrub negative reviews should tell you enough to be cautious about this company. ?€?Just a reminder that temu.com has flagged your review because they don?€?t think it?€?s based on a genuine experience. You have 2 days left to reply with more information and keep your review online.?€?Edit 3: Three weeks later and I have yet to receive a valid response back after emailing the address below. All I got was a generic message and then got ghosted. My review holds. Temu is a very poorly run company, with nonexistent support.",1,17/05/2024
"This is crazy, Im putting up yet another negative review due to the fact this site will not give me my ??26 back on some items I returned on the 29th of april, They dont even try to help you instead they send a sarcastic bot which just tells you to contact them, I paid using apple pay too making this refund harder, If I dont get my money back in 2 days from now minimum im going through my bank as this is frankly unacceptable and dont even get me started with the live chat which has such ridiculous wait times you may aswell not bother, I dont think they realise some people have lives to liveTL;DR Dont ever try to get a refund/return from this company",1,17/05/2024

"I've had my third order just arrive today and my products so far over the month were mostly great in quality and many free too. There may be hiccups with the time it takes for delivery/tracking (which is understandable especially since shipping is free I didn't mind) and one parcel had a tear which may have caused one item to be missing (it was only a pound which makes up for the free items I got so I'm not mad).. Maybe the other downside is the minigames being too excessive however I don't think temu deserves some of the super harsh reviews I've been reading.. Maybe it's because I've had a good experience thankfully?... Personally, I've cut down on the excessive ordering now because I'm understanding the general unsustainability and ethical concerns of contributing to fast fashion and low worker wages. Before temu, I really wasn't ordering anything.",4,17/05/2024

"As always, especially with new companies outside my own country, I look for positive reviews from unpaid verified members of the public. Having done all this, I sent an order for ??32+ and ETA was 18-20th May'23It arrived today,17th and I have no idea how they pack it all into such a small parcel, individually wrapped, without compromising the goods. I should have know that Chinese companies are on top of their game. Expert packing, 5??? communication, excellent delivery and payment options and when I went on their chat page because I could not find one small item, I was refunded before I had finished the sentence. It's all automated so you tick which order you want to discuss then a page appears with your order and you click the circle by the item. I can't rate them highly enough after this, my first experience. Innovative items, superb everything and delivered by EVRi on time. I'm stunned at the seamless transaction and I have already sent another order.",5,17/05/2024
"I ordered from Temu in April, I had my doubts period. I didn't have a problem. They were clear about the shipping dates, they do give credit to your account if it goes over. I returned two items, they refunded me in four days. They sent me an email the next day to keep me informed. Some people claim that this site is cheap  or only selling cheap BUT.... When my son wants socks just to run around in, I don't care. When I was a wind chime that worked every single day without batteries and it lights up the back yard so I can see clearly, I don't care. The price on a 1 dollar net for my morning glory flowers was appropriate. The flowers don't care, they appreciate that net to get them up in the morning. I'm sure you would appreciate 50 cents off your coffee to get you up in the morning. The shirts were just fine for the store, the check out reps don't care.",5,17/05/2024

The items took over 2 weeks to arrive.  They took the money immediately though....Items were far too big.  Website says 12/14.  They are more like 16/18.  Huge.  Pointless returning...can only imagine how long that takes.,2,18/05/2024
"At first I was very impressed. I placed orders on 3 different occasions. Some small items were to be returned, Temu immediately credited me, and told me not to return the items. Fast forward. My 4th order had some small items that didn't meet the description of Temu's website listing, so I asked for return. They offer free returns, and they supplied the UPS shipping label. I sent them back. They have been delivered back to them. Their policy is to immediately refund upon receipt of return. I haven't received refund. I called and waited and waited. Twice. Never speaking to anybody. I tried to chat, 3 times, again, never chatted with anybody. Their que kept removing me even though I kept active. I still haven't communicated with anyone there. I think I am done ordering from them, it's just not worth the aggravation. The refund amount is very small, less than $4, so why would they treat it as such a problem. I sang their praises, not anymore!*Update 5/18/2023, Temu has acknowledged receipt of my return. I still have not been refunded. I received an email telling me that I should expect refund in 5-14 days, then additional time for it to post to my cc account.*Update 05/20/2023, Temu has acknowledged receipt of my return, I still have not received my refund.When will retail learn to treat customers with the respect they deserve?",1,18/05/2024

Temu I ordered some stuff from you and I was suppose to have received it since 13th of may and up until date have not received the package and have heard from other people that it?€?s always like that when things are ordered from you Evri sent me a message that the delivery address was wrong same Evri got a package delivered to me today from another brand using the same address I contacted Evri and I was referred back to you I never knew it?€?s a scam buying from your brand My address remain the same no changes and I don?€?t know where the problem is coming from am going to cancel all the other items have picked from you brand and stop buying from you I need my package or my total refund,1,18/05/2024

"Alrighty I have tried to get answers about five times now or at least some simblance of the process that was going on with my account, the first time I tried to used the customer service hotline I was on hold until your customer service line closed down. The second attempt I opened a ticket for customer service through the live chat, when I finally got a response it wasn?€?t an answer at all and wasn?€?t really told anything then was told to wait 14 days and ask for an update then they closed the ticket not answering any of my questions, then I attempted to call again and was put on hold for 3 and a half hours and no one spoke to me and yet again was disconnected when the customer service line closed at 7. I have since sent two replies to the ticket I put in  5 days ago and it?€?s still processing. It is not a matter of figuring out what is wrong it is a matter of what is the process and steps to fix it? There was unauthorized activity on my account which is why I received a refund from my financial institution and from Temu, so now there is store credit that is my refund that I cannot access and I can?€?t even order on my account as of right now, so I?€?ve lost money and my account and no one is even trying to help with even explaining the process. I don?€?t know what to do at this point because it just seems like I?€?m talking to a brick wall I?€?m not trying to be rude at all I?€?m just extremely frustrated because that?€?s $106 I can?€?t put back in my bank account and have to use as store credit. So if anyone could help me with the problem or just explain what the process of fixing this is so I know something is being done I would greatly appreciate it. I?€?ve already talked to my bank and to pay pal, and they both told me this is an issue on the apps end that I had to work it out with Temu. I'm starting to get extremely stressed about this whole situation. I can't imagine the amount of tickets they have to go through and problems they have to solve, but I now have $106 that I can't get back because it's store credit and can't use it either because my account is locked and I can't even order anything anyways.Update:?€? I have now sent and email as well so we will see what happens with that (may 17)?€? I was finally responded to by email but they didn?€?t understand that I wasn?€?t asking for a refund or money and told me that it?€?s my bank?€?s responsibility and they were unable to do anything for me. I?€?m asking for someone to fix my account so I can use my store credit and place orders on my account and I don?€?t understand how that?€?s something my bank does. I explained that in an email and am currently waiting yet again for a response since 8:44 AM (may 18)",2,18/05/2024

"I am very happy with my purchases of women?€?s clothing and the Temu return policy. The blouses I purchased do look like the photos. Of course I am realistic that my body shape is not that of the model. I found the plus size blouses to be true to size as per their size chart and are of very good quality. My shipment came surprisingly quick, less than one week. Returns are easy. The only con is that once you order they will bombard you with multiple incentives to get you to return over and over again.",5,18/05/2024

"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. In March 2023 I Purchased two pairs of Ladies wedge flip flip arch support sandals at a cost of $US54, with shipping and it amounted to $64 in total. They arrived mid April and I took them on a cruise with me in May. Unfortunately both pairs tore apart after only 4 days wear on the cruise (obviously faulty)  leaving them unwearable. However when I complained and sent photos of the sandals to TEMU they offered me an insulting $10 saying because they had supplied the product I ordered there was nothing they could do.

"I'm changing my review from 1 to 5 stars.The original review (the reason for the 1star):I placed the order. I was given a delivery date of 16-17 May. On the 15th I got a message that the the courier was on their way, and as it was close to 5 PM it seemed great as I would be home soon to pick it up. But in less than half an hour I get another message that the courier was delayed and it would be delivered another day. So DHL tried to deliver it again today (the 16th). I was at work. They didn't leave it with a neighbor, they didn't leave it at nearby pick-up location, they are not coming back tomorrow. Nope. It goes back to the sender. So I contacted customer support. I had 114 people in front of in in the chat box, I waited around an hour for my turn, and finally got someone. As I was trying to see if there are any options to the delivery, the person was running through their script. Apparently their recommendation is to have someone at home while the delivery is taking place. Even though you don't know in advance when the delivery will take place and even if the courier is on their way the delivery could be cancelled. In the meantime the script was asking if some products are not in stock, or not available for other reasons, would I accept a refund? Yes. So now apparently I am getting a refund for the order. I'm not sure if this was because they assumed from my questions about the delivery options that I was requesting a refund, even though I had requested reshipment; or if they just didn't want to talk about delivery options and they decided that a refund would end the conversation.The reason for changing the rating:At 7:38 PM, when I was still at work (mostly because I had decided to go to the cinema straight from work) I got a notification that the package was delivered. The shopping app was still saying that I am getting a refund, and the DHL message from earlier in the day hadn't been changed from 'return to sender' to 'will try to deliver again', so I thought that maybe they were informing me that the sender got the package. But no, I got back from the cinema and my package was with the neighbours. ????So I am changing my rating, and I am giving full stars because DHL doesn't just try again on the same day, so I think that this was the work of customer support. ????But I would recommend adding an check box to the app where people can indicate that the package can be left with neighbours.",5,19/05/2024

"Mixed feelings. Ordered three items to try out the service. These arrived today but one was neither the colour nor size I requested. Checked my order and it shows that the item delivered IS on my order. The item I selected is out of stock. So I now have an item 3 sizes too small and a colour I'd never have chosen! I'm not going to go through the hassle of returning as I can pass it on to someone with a tiny dog. I may order again but am concerned that my PayPal account was suspended due to ""suspicious account activity"" shortly after placing the order. Other items were good quality for the price.",3,19/05/2024
"I have ordered a few times from SHEIN so I thought I?€?d give TEMU a try when it launched. I ordered a few items and they arrived perfectly in time. All the items match the photos and description, obviously it?€?s all cheap Chinese quality which is perfectly fine for most things but you should keep that in mind when you order. One of the items I ordered was too small when I tried it on so I asked to return it, TEMU gave me the option to get a refund on my original payment method or in credits for the website that I can use on a future order (faster option). I chose the credits and the app informed me that I didn?€?t need to return the item to receive the refund so all in all I?€?m quite satisfied with the service. Whenever you order from one of these chinese Shops it can be a little bit of a gamble but it?€?s probably one worth taking if the refund process is so easy.",5,19/05/2024

"I have been trying with no success to reach someone, anyone, with Temu customer support. They show my order as delivered but it was never received. The order was shipped but there was an issue with the post office losing it or delivering to the wrong address. I followed all of their suggested recommendations of what to do if an order is not received and I'm trying to get a reshipment. On the Temu app I entered the required info for reshipment and whenever I hit submit it pops up with "" please contact customer support. I've tried numerous times to contact them thru the live support and it's nothing but a frustrating waste of time. After being # 586 in line and waiting over an hour each time when I got to the 160's in line it says they have disconnected from the chat session and to recontact them if I still need help. Now when I try to contact them thru their live chat option it says there's no connection and try again later. I've tried calling every customer service number they have listed. They're ALL disconnected. Take a look through the responses from Temu to other reviews on this site. Every phone number they have listed is disconnected. Sent emails with no reply or acknowledgement from them.There's no way to contact anyone.",1,20/05/2024
"I rather skeptically purchased a  watch for monitoring sleep and activities. I did not want to pay the extreme prices well known brands charge for the same product. To my surprise the watch arrived, late delivery, and I was given $5 credit which I learned later that there is a minimum spend before i can use it. That is a little deceptive. However, the watch does what I expect accept it misses the first two hours of sleep every night. I also use the Google App on my phone to compare and the App on my phone records a better night sleep that the App that comes with the watch. The App and the watch are connected by ""bluetooth"" and it is a little disappointing. However, for $38 what can one expect. It is cheaper than $500-$600 you would pay for a over priced well known brand watch. I think if the Temu company did deals with the well known brands and sold them cheap it would be a 5 star experience. I will be ordering a band for the watch as the rubber band has already split from the watch itself. However, I can't just buy the watch band for $2.00 using my credit because there is a minimum spend. A good marketing strategy to get people to buy more of something they don't really need. I believe in a free market so if you want to compete, be innovative. Better quality at a good price will always win over cheap poor quality.",4,20/05/2024

"I have never had a problem with Temu in Canada.  I think I have only returned 1 item without any trouble.  Some times the order is a day or so late and if it is, they give you $5.00 on your account which will be used against your next next order.  There are a couple of things that I would like to mention: 1)  Is the bright orange packaging.  The porch thieves can see that orange bag from 10 blocks away.  ;)    A nice elegant black bag  or even just a plain brown wrapper.  The porch has a couple of places to leave things so they are hidden but our delivery people put it smack dab in the middle at the top of the steps for all to see.2)  You have to really look at what you are buying.   Right now I want to buy 2 ink cartridges for my printer. In looking at them they talk about the black and colour combo but when you put them in your cart the price given is for each cartridge and not a combo.Sorry for those having issues.",4,20/05/2024
"As a first time customer overall I am very satisfied with Temu.   I ordered a few hundred 3-D sleep masks to use as blindfolds during our TV game show style programs (plus a few other things).  Temu had the style of blindfold that we wanted (does not allow blindfolded person to see anything, good looking on-stage and in photos and inexpensive).  I needed the large quantity because we give each contestant the blindfold to take home at the conclusion of their games and use a new blindfold for the next contestant.Ordering was easy.  There were many discount offers that I accepted.  Temu kept me informed about delivery, etc. The items arrived in large plastic bags (not boxes).  Many of the items were exactly what we wanted and in mint condition.  However, there were two problems: 1) A substantial number of the blindfolds were not the style we ordered and 2) Due to the tight packaging in the plastic bags a substantial number came damaged.  Temu's customer service team was very helpful and promptly issued refunds for the incorrect and the damaged items.   I plan to order from them again in the future.",5,20/05/2024

"I was skeptical about ordering from this company due to some negative reviews. With this information to work from, I ordered using Paypal as a safeguard, as some reviews highlighted their credit card was compromised after using this site (suggesting Temu need to address the security on the site). The order I placed was regularly updated and arrived within the specified time slot. The clothing I ordered (2 tops and a swimsuit) was accurately sized and a much better quality than I would expect from the price-tag. I ordered bags and odd bits and pieces (gadgety type things) which were okay in quality (unlikely to last long), but for the price they will serve their purpose - pound land quality at less than half the price). I ordered a cheap holdall, which I have used for a night away, and although flimsy, it served its purpose (useful for Ryanair flights, who charge you for every breath you take lol). I ordered false nails, which look to be the same quality as I usually buy (as yet I haven't tried them). A couple of things were a bit naff, but that is the nature of this type of site. Overall though, I would say I got value for money and will order from them again.",5,21/05/2024

I have since placed an additional four orders for multiple items.I am not sure what the issue is regarding the quality of the items: They are from China. You are not buying ROLEX or MERCEDES quality.

"I saw opening ads on social media and did small order but then I read reviews and felt very deflated But was no need my order arrived quicker than expected and everything was great.I?€?ve since ordered 5 times lol and been really happy with whole experience. Temu keep your updated with tracking on order and everything I?€?ve received has been good quality, until today one of ramen pots lids was cracked but returns procedure is so simple and trouble free.Great value, clear tracking free delivery and simple returns.Honestly great company to deal with have no complaints at all.Promotion games Ive not took part in but have received voucher for money of order simply for make order and ??5 credit because order delivered day late Wow.Really have no negatives other than so many bargains I keep order lol put another order in today.Keep up good work I?€?m recommending to all family and friends",5,21/05/2024
"If ordering fragile items.. don?€?t bother. I ordered 2 glass mugs and they came completely in thousands of pieces and got glass all over my floor. I also ordered a new lunchbox on there and it was thick plastic and still somehow was smashed up, so the glass had no chance. Things come fully damaged or don?€?t work, no better than Wish or eBay. Temu isn?€?t worth it.",2,21/05/2024
"Quite good!One item broke, I filed a return and they let me keep it.Came within a week and a half, that's very good. Spent ??20, got about 8 items! Would shop againOnly downside is the referral scheme, you need to refer about 10 people and it keeps saying ""free gift"" but makes you refer more each time , and realistically you never get a gift.",5,21/05/2024
"I was very untrustworthy of this website due to the bad reviews. But I have to say I was really surprised. I ordered ??60 worth of items and gadgets, I was sent tracking information through the whole process, my bag of goodies turned up on time, all 48 items were correct and I am very happy. Already got a cart full of items ready for my next order. Thank you Temu.  ????",5,21/05/2024
"Great stuff and so inexpensive. Ten stars for all the cute stuff I have. One star for the fact that whenever I shop on there, I get a bunch of spam texts. I use the website on my phone to shop. It comes from a gibberish email address and says your Netflix account is locked! Etc.",3,22/05/2024
"Good for picking up cheap bits for the home , and decent sensory toys for not to much money. Got a heavily reduced childs back pack with my first delivery which my youngest now uses for school. So far it's faired well and was exactly as picture . Delivered in good time with packaging that suited the nature of the items I bought.",4,22/05/2024
"I am giving a 4 star because from start to finish I knew where my delivery was. My shoes are fantastic. the dresses how ever I think will be going back the material is so thin it would be like putting on a nightie, It is a great shame because I really liked them",4,22/05/2024
"Actually surprised that I?€?ve received everything and the quality has been half decent. It?€?s very much like SHEIN! My delivery turned up a week later, only one faulty item. I did try contacting customer services but there was a 2 hour wait and for a free item I?€?ve just left it. I?€?ve been playing the games for the free credits and coupons and so far have won ??30 credit, so I?€?ll be placing my next order soon. The games are 100% worth playing if you can refer 4 people. Download the app and type BBB5044420 in the search bar and it should bring them all up for you.",4,22/05/2024
"Done the refer a friend for credit games a few times and it?€?s amazing. I got over ??200 credit to spend and received my items within 5 days. Lovely items too for the price. Usually if it?€?s too good to be true then it usually is, but in this case it actually is just what it says. Definitely would recommend!!",5,22/05/2024
"I was advertised and had Temu shoved in my face constantly, finally, I sign up, get a few items and?€? get slapped with minimum order of $30 condition, which wasn?€?t ideal, especially considering it wasn?€?t the same for everyone. I wrote a review and mentioned the minimum order. After using it for a few orders, here is an update. The minimum order requirement was scrapped, not sure if just for me or for everyone. I had all things tested - the delivery timeframe, the price adjustment and the coupons. Happy to say everything is as promised. The most surprising part is the delivery, which is where Temu really shines. The delivery timeframe is 7-10 days and the order literally gets delivered on the promised date, for me it was 7 days, tracked all the way with ?€?out for delivery?€? being exactly as stated. After waiting for months and missing quite a few things from other similar website, this is the best thing. Other similar website started charging some crazy delivery prices post-pandemic, but deliveries remained pretty hit and miss and took even longer. I am on my 4th order, I try to pack everything in one go, all items arrive in one large bag, nothing arrives smashed, mashed or not as described, quite a few items exceeded expectations. None of that one item arrives a month later, others you check every day to see if there. I know my initial review wasn?€?t glowing, I take it all back, Temu has fully redeemed itself. I didn?€?t have any issues and I am truly pleasantly surprised.",2,22/05/2024
I love everything I've ordered except for the bath towels which were actually wash clothes.The prices are very reasonable.,5,22/05/2024
"Temu is your typical third party shopping experience. Sometimes it's gonna be great, sometimes it's cheap crap. So far I've placed about 5 orders & I haven't been dissatisfied, you just gotta know how to shop & read the product description/reviews.",5,22/05/2024
"Received my first order from Temu . I love everything I got , apart from night shorts and top set , the top being way to small . The order came really quickly , at a bargain price , and they?€?re better than I would have an imagine . I would order more stuff but I do t want another app on my phone",4,22/05/2024
One of the poorest e-commerce site bad service first time I order from here order totally wrong with someone else name on there crossed out and place my details . order was delayed and took longer then usual waiting for a chat with customer support and I am 380 in the queue. Outrageous,1,22/05/2024
Received my order today and couldn't be happier great fast service.and items as pictured.,5,22/05/2024
Recently ordered some kitchen items and artificial flowers.  I cannot fault the service provided I was missing a couple of items and received refund within a few days.  Kept informed of delivery and order from start to finish.  The items are not John Lewis stand which some people expect....be realistic at this prices they may not suit some people.  I am more than happy.,5,22/05/2024
Never used and don't want to.Tried to block this site. Constantly receiving promotion emails and keep saying I do not want this ad. Getting thisc2vorc3 times a day. Sick of it. If anyone knows how to block this please let me know.,1,22/05/2024
Very pleased with my purchase. Ordered two tee-shirts and I like the material which is quite silky. Liked the way I was kept informed all along about delivery and what stage it was at and offering money back if it was late. It arrived exactly when they said and that is great. Prices are very good too. Well done.,5,22/05/2024
To be honest after seeing the negative reviews I was sceptical but 4 of my tops are really lovely.Only 1 top not so good but that could just be my taste.Well done Temu,4,22/05/2024
"I've placed 3 orders and received my first. Really pleased with the products I bought. Was a bit worried when I read some other reviews of Temu. Packaging isn't important. Getting the right products, value for money and on-time is what matters. The shipping process is great. They update you every step of the way until your order is delivered. Will definitely continue to be a customer.",5,22/05/2024
Honestly I?€?d ordered and then read the reviews so I wasn?€?t expecting much - but I was surprised when everything came as ordered - I always use PayPal on these things anyway and keep track of any extra transactions but everything was perfect,5,22/05/2024
"Delivered on the day stated, full order, lounge wear super soft.",5,22/05/2024
"I ordered lots of car accessories and I was so surprised. The quality was actually lovely! I was really put off ordering at first because it gave me the same vibes as wish, but honestly overall it was brilliant and came in under a week!",5,22/05/2024
"At this price, temu is unbeatable... looking to the Singapore station as soon as possible!!!",5,22/05/2024
"I have ordered more than 10 products at a time?€? all products are delivered successfully. In the app it mentioned as for late delivery some amount will get credited . The amount is not credited yet. Other than that, Products are amazing especially for kids????????????????????",5,22/05/2024
"I received my package which was poorly taped together and when I checked the items inside, I had multiple missing items. I requested a refund for the missing items but was denied. I raised a ticket on this issues, and the agent just responded giving me instructions on how to file for the refund and closed the ticket, this is a method I already followed and was denied a refund. I'm not given the option to live chat anymore (I had this option before) but I checked with my friends who haven't ordered from Temu yet and they they have that option. I'm not sure if they're taking this option away from everyone that placed orders to avoid having to answer concerns, but this is just crazy how this option was taken away from me. I then tried calling customer support and am now waiting on the call. It's been over 2 hours now and I'm still waiting. Very bad customer service and no way of resolving issues. Never seen a company with such bad and slow customer service.",1,22/05/2024
"Until now, everything was real ????",5,22/05/2024
"I ordered because i was curious after my husband came across the online shop, i ordered random bits and tbf it made me giggle opening the things because they were so cheap but absolutely fine products, only issue was i ordered 3 claw clips 1 had a lil break but iv glued it and its fine.",5,22/05/2024
I was pleasantly surprised. I was apprehensive about ordering as I do not normally do online shopping. So i put a small order to check it out. My order arrived on time and I was kept upto date via email and sms. The quality of the good was definitely ok for the price I paid. And I will be ordering again.,5,22/05/2024
Why do they need my email password before I can buy even via PayPal?Update 13th May.Very good but that still doesn't tell me why you need my email password?Now you won't let me buy via PayPal your site is not easy and after reducing the price from ?? 10 you are now saying to make it up to ??10 from the tat you are displaying. I don't want the tat just this one shirt which I will pay ??10. I'll try once more on your inept website,1,22/05/2024
Received my order on time & paid ??0 due to referring friends & receiving free credit from the games on the TEMU app! The quality of everything I ordered is really good! Would recommend!,5,23/05/2024
"I have used Wish before and tbh wasn't expecting much different. However I ordered craft bits as I make my own greetings cards and the items were of good standard and had free delivery via Yodel, only taking 8 days whereas with other companies I have waited weeks before so I am completely happy with my purchases, I am not sure if the quality of all items will be the same standard but you get what you pay for, in my case it was not much at all but as good as I would get for card making elsewhere",5,23/05/2024
I am totally sick of Temu emailing me. There is no unsubscribe area and I am extremely fed up with them.,1,23/05/2024
"Good app for shopping cheap items at discount. Found it similar to aliexpress. However Their referral reward scheme seems like a scam, don't waste time in trying to win anything.",4,23/05/2024
"I ordered a backpack and a couple of shirts from Temu.  Paid less than twenty quid so didn't expect much.  Was pleasantly surprised when they arrived within a week, nicely packed and better quality than I expected for what I paid.  Would use them again and I have in fact just placed another order.",5,23/05/2024
"It's always refreshing to see something new, and Temu has come up with some very interesting and exciting products that are very inexpensive. I ordered quite a few items already and I am very satisfied with the products and the delivery time. I love the fact that they always keep you in the loop of where your product is on the delivery timeline and even though it takes a bit longer than other online stores, it is free! The only thing I find kind of funny is how messy the packaging is. Looks like a 10-year-old wrapped it in a rush. I think if the products are packaged nicer it would be a better experience for the customer and a better image for Temu.",5,23/05/2024
"Got my second order early than what was told, everything I ordered and all worked. Love this site",5,23/05/2024
"Ordered through the website. All items arrived in the specified times and were of great quality and were well packed. Recieved text and email notifications with tracking info throughout the purchase process. Brilliant, will definately buy again and ty for a great service!",5,23/05/2024
"Liars thieves and scammers. Temu offered bundles when you order. My offer was a ??70 bundle, which never was received I checked coupons and other tabs and nothing. They also hike prices I saw senbowe wireless headphones for ??47. Plus and elsewhere the exact ones were less than ??5 Do not trust do not place orders.Also they charge for out of stock items. Be careful.Dear tee moo... why bother replying,  if you ignore the reason for complaint? Spp is now deleted. Bye ????",1,23/05/2024
Iv won loads and all items are coming. And decent quality,5,23/05/2024
The promotion games are fake and impossible to win I did everything it told me to do I refered a new user to get my reward and when I contacted customer service all I got was some fake excuse do not fall for this Its like a pyramid scheme,1,23/05/2024
"Unfortunately I have to give one star only as I?€?ve spent online over ??120 and when I have received the packages, it came just covered by orange plastic foil, no even in the box to protect the product so when I?€?ve unpacked the original packages were visibly damaged like when car drove over it. This is not the quality that I am expecting. Very bad first impression",1,23/05/2024
2 stars because delivery was quicker than I thought. I bought a 5 tier book shelf for original price 37$ with 10$ off it was as 27$ plus 1$ tax total about 28$. It was a very flimsy plastic shelf. Not worth $37 original priced. I duck taped it so it would stay together for the time being.,2,23/05/2024
"Great new app! I won ??40 to spend on this app so placed an order for some bits then found some more things I wanted so ordered them too, I got one parcel yesterday and one the day before. I?€?m so happy with everything I got it was all as advertised and didn?€?t take long to come at all compared to wish, SHEIN etc?€? as long as you bother to read the description you?€?ll get what you want! Really happy",5,23/05/2024
"Worst site ever! If part of your order is damaged, you?€?re out of luck. They don?€?t offer exchanges. And the minimum spend to place an order is $20. I got an item for $3 with a special promotion that arrived crushed from shipping damaged. Temu refuses to allow me to exchange it. They said the only option was to return for a refund, and then I have to buy $20 worth of stuff I don?€?t want in order to repurchase the one item.  Plus, they won?€?t honor the promotional price. So it will be double the cost plus I?€?d be forced to buy other stuff I don?€?t want. Horrible. I will never shop here again.",1,23/05/2024
"I was completely skeptical like everyone else is with this app, I've recieved over ??900 in credit and put no bank details and my orders have come relatively quickly. I've still got more to come but my tracking is updated every day by text & email. The stuff is decent too most is amazing quality some stuff isn't but it was free and I genuinely have no complaints at all.",5,23/05/2024
Was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised! Thank you Temu .Will shop again .,5,23/05/2024
"Ordered from the app once - received a $5 credit as package was not delivered on time, but in order to use the credit I would need to spend a minimum of $20. Not worth it, as most items already purchased were of poor quality - some were damaged prior to shipping or produced badly (sunglasses nosepiece was attached incorrectly). The Temu branded bag had an overwhelmingly awful smell when opened (similar smell to fish, but so much worse)...it literally stunk up the room. I will not ever order from here again based off the poor quality and hassle of returning items that should never have been sold. Also, I don't want to spam friends to get ""free"" stuff. Deleting the app now.",1,23/05/2024
Breaking New Zealand consumer law by continually advertising products as being on special....but that is the normal price for them.   If your going to sell internationally then should be abiding by local laws.,1,23/05/2024
It was very good free shipping first order and completely cheeper that Amazon.,5,23/05/2024
"Okay, i had update my review. The order was delayed but it got delivered today. I got a little anxious when it was delayed. The items all came and it was exactly as expected. I will be ordering again for sure.",5,23/05/2024
"Great for the price! It's very similar to Shein, but with faster shipping. I've placed a few orders and almost all have been perfect. One wasn't delivered, which was a USPS issue, but Temu gave me a full refund when I let them know it didn't arrive. My experience with them has been amazing!",4,23/05/2024
"Don't play there games I am still talking to them to honer their ??200 credit from one of their games, this is fauls advertising and against the consumer rights they only get back to you once and you wait 2 hours to talk to someone even then they don't know about their own system very wellMy ticket number for the case is 1683652971210121",1,24/05/2024
"My order was late they gave me ??5 credit which I used yesterday but then became wary and started reading the reviews and became scared. Then I checked tracking and found that the parcel had been delivered. What a surprise everything is great. The quality, for the money I paid is brilliant. The parcel was in very good condition without any damage. So thank you Temu!",5,24/05/2024
"Just received my first order ,everything fabulous ,really happy with the whole transaction from start to finished ,they kept me well informed about my parcel ,arrived a lot earlier then expected ,can?€?t fault a thing ,incredible to receive all this at such a low cost ,thank you temu.com",5,24/05/2024
needs to give more free stuff but other than that good,5,24/05/2024
"I received my first order yesterday. I received a tracking info message every day. I was skeptical about opening it, because the outside packaging was thin and crinkled, but I was pleasantly surprised! It contained my six items. Two figures were inside formed styrofoam in their individual boxes, one plastic item was in bubble wrap. The others did not need special packaging. I will definitely be ordering again!Katie",5,24/05/2024
"I will say first Temu is definitely worth a try. Some people like it, some don?€?t, and there are some who go into it planning on not liking it in order to be disappointed and share this with the world as nothing pleases them. The thing about Temu that many do not understand is that all of the items you buy are from many different shops. Temu being the name for this combined effort, gets all the the feedback, negative or not. So before making a purchase, be a responsible buyer and check reviews. Also, read full descriptions, and check for photos from other buyers. This will help you determine whether or not the item you want to purchase is actually the item you want to purchase. Not everything is going to be the exact quality you want, as this isn?€?t Saks Fifth Avenue..  but for the price, quality is well worth it. I myself have made many purchases, and so far I am pleased with all but one. And it is from one particular shop that sends its items without any care. It is merely placed in the Temu bag instead of a proper box to prevent bending and such. I have still bought multiple of this item, knowing that I will receive a somewhat damaged item. But that is my choice, and I find it worth it even though most would not. For the price I simply cannot complain. I have had a customer service complaint, and it was handled. The situation was dealt with, as Temu had to contact the shop, and the shop worked with Temu. Everything was made right, and I was happy with this. Shipping isn?€?t always the fastest, and I cannot always see where my package is, but I always recieve what I?€?ve bought and that is fine by me. Also, if a price of any purchase drops, you can ask for a price adjustment and they pay back whatever the difference is. All in the 30 days after purchase. You can open daily boxes and win change each day too. So in turn, you can make money by buying from them. That?€?s just awesome.  Overall experience dealing with Temu I have to give it 5 stars. Another thing, this is not wish, so you don?€?t have to wait a year for your order, and the quality, in my opinion, is much better. Just be careful.. Temu is very fun and addictive! So make you?€?re purchase and enjoy :)",5,24/05/2024
"I ordered some products for my new Ebike, Items were shipped, But it now says arrived at airport 5 days ago, and still no more tracking updates on this shipmentMy Ebike will be here Friday 5/12/2023, But still no updated tracking from Temu, Ok not Temu's fault it was USPS not updating there tracking info, My package arrived within Temu's time frame for tracking",5,24/05/2024
I have referred people and got the free gifts and money and everything has arrived as ordered nothing is missing or broken some things r different quality but as we all know we get what we pay for and some things r really good I would recommend them,5,24/05/2024
"No issues, ordered a sofa cover to test quality and a backpack for my babies stuff as my other broke I was blown away by the quality so just put in my second order to fully protect my sofa the only issue I found was the sofa cover set I brought I couldn't find the armrest covers for but I easily sorted that by buying the 1 seat covers to go on the outside from bottom to the top so they have some protection",5,24/05/2024
"My daughter kept bugging me to click on the links she sent on WhatsApp. She wanted to get free stuff. I was unwilling at first. Clicked reluctantly. I think you need to send to as many people as possible. I could not believe my eyes when they sent her a big package. All free stuff: lip gloss, summer dresses, essential oils, hair accessories and a whole lot of other goodies. She absolutely loved every single one of them. This app is truly delightful! Wow, well done Temu!!",5,24/05/2024
"I have now ordered three times from Temu and I?€?m awaiting forth order. All have been delivered on time and I do agree with other reviews that packaging so very good the items inside were not damaged. I have been very pleased with all the items I have received, especially the girls princess dresses. They were a fraction of the cost I?€?ve paid in stores  and of standard quality.",4,24/05/2024

"Bought shoes, flashlight, foot support insole. Had a coupon for 5 bucks, free shipping. Arrived in about a couple of weeks. All items are as described will buy again. there in the future.",4,24/05/2024
"I have updated my original review after reading the reply from Temu with the offer of a refund. For the cost of my order I'm not going to follow up on a refund as I online shop due to convenience and lack of time, so I'm not interested in buying packaging and going to the Post Office to return. However, the offer is good customer service and I'll increase the stars for that reason. I stand by my comment that the packaging was the worst I?€?ve ever seen with everything screwed up in a ball and squashed together. This meant the small ring binder plastic envelopes I bought are so creased they won?€?t lie flat. I have dealt with other companies that sell inexpensive products and the packaging has been good so there is no excuse for poor packaging.",3,24/05/2024
The site is legit with fast delivery by evri you get a tracking number for every order and theres good quality items for the money happy shopping ???€,5,24/05/2024

"I just recieved my 1st order and I can not fault a single item, I read some of the reviews after placing my order which did not look too great with many one star reviews, a lot being about the time for delivery and not knowing when their order will arrive so I would like to give my advice to anyone reading this by telling you to make sure you select tracking notifications and not to worry as I was updated on the whole journey of my parcel every day regarding its whereabouts. I am very impressed as everything has turned out to be perfect so far with not a single complaint.Thank you TEMU, I am very greatful.Until next time my new friends!Best wishesDaniel Price",5,25/05/2024
I have enjoyed the quick shipping and the great stuff at cheap prices!!,5,25/05/2024
Delivery came with in the time scale no issues or problems at all trainers fit perfect and are so comfy would certainly order again thankyou,5,25/05/2024
Two stars instead of one because postage and tracking was good. Clothing is very poor quality. Sizing is rubbish and all over the place. In the process of sending everything back. Not sure how this will go. Don't waste your time.,2,25/05/2024
"Cannot stop or delete their ads in my emails.  Since the new ad choices in my phone no longer enable me to block senders, I have to delete each email from Temu. Then another one appears and it has been constant.  I tried to send a query on how remove my email address from their mailing list, but had to register to do that so now I'm stuck!",1,25/05/2024
"Let?€?s be honest a lot of the negative reviews on here don?€?t quite add up, I joined temu uk a couple of weeks ago and have already placed over ??800 worth of orders and it?€?s cost me ??0 in total!, all you do is get friends and family sign up with your link to hit a bonus to then spend on the site at no cost to yourselves!, I?€?ve received some of my orders so far as the rest are currently on there way with 2 delivery companies so due this week, the quality of the products are alright but I wouldn?€?t expect anything better, customer service is also great I had an order which Evri left on my doorstep while I was out and wasn?€?t there when I arrived home, temu was not to blame it was down to Evri for leaving it there, however customer service refunded the order amount back on to my account as credit because I paid with the bonus funds as again I haven?€?t actually spent any money on here myself, so overall I?€?d definitely recommend this app join up go to earn credit and share your link with people you know you?€?ll soon have some free orders arriving at your house!, I think 99% of the bad reviews on here are down to people who can?€?t get sign ups so therefor don?€?t get a bonus and then moan about it after!",5,25/05/2024
"All products arrived on time if not earlier than expected, it's launch in the UK was a success, your able to save on things you may not have needed around the house, the toys are brilliant, sturdy and well put together, all electronics are great. my boys love them, I'm yet to try and order clothes. But overall the experience is great",5,25/05/2024
I love this app its so easy to work and iv received all my orders UK ???????? People keep saying it's a SCAM 10001% NOT A SCAM LIKE IV RECEIVED ALL MINE AND GOT MORE COMMING JUST BECAUSE YOU CANT GET YOUR CREDIT DONT GO ABOUT SAYING ITS A SCAM....SO GET BACK IN YAH PLANT POT AND GROW UP :P,5,25/05/2024
All these people moaning and complaining about everything. They signed up for emails. If you don?€?t want the spam then just delete your account and unsubscribe from their emails. I have no problem with this app. I?€?ve had 7 parcels. 2 arrived 5 on the way with the courier ???? the quality of the products are amazing and I?€?ve no issues whatsoever. This app is legit and to all saying it?€?s not you tried to say that about SHEIN and now look it?€?s one of the most popular used daily LMAO. NOTHING MORE THAN A BUNCH OF KARENS MOANING Cause they can?€?t get referrals to get credit! You all ordered off wish too ;) and dhgate and aliexpress no one believed in them but now they?€?re well known companies LOL. Man up. If you don?€?t want to buy then don?€?t simple :),5,25/05/2024
"OK, initially I purchased stuff from temu and the stuff came as quickly as expected and the quality was pretty good. So then I ordered more and same thing ... pretty good quality, quick arrival, great pricing. So on my 3rd order that I was about to place I found that they had craft stuff (for my hobby). Unfortunately I found craft stuff is a direct copy of things that have been crafted by my favourite ETSY suppliers as well as high quality craft supply producers that I regularly buy from. I was disappointed.NOTE... from their reply below I will contact them with screen shots of some of the counterfeit stuff that I found - we will see what happens!",1,25/05/2024
"I placed 3 orders before checking this site! After reading the trust rating I was mortified and convinced I was going to learn a hard lesson. Today, my first order arrived. It was mainly baby items for a friend who recently discovered she was pregnant. I bought a sleeper gown w hat, swaddle blanket w hat, transitional swaddle, Velcro swaddle, milestone blanket, and wooden hangers to separate clothes in the closet. I bought all of this for $32. On Amazon a transitional swaddle alone costs that much! Even before reading the reviews I was half expecting the product to arrive and be bad quality or garbage, but I'm so glad I took the risk. The quality was just as good on anything you could buy here in the US! One of the swaddles was so soft I almost wanted to keep it for myself. The milestone blanket wasn't as soft as I anticipated, but it wasn't rough either and it was beautiful! My only actual criticism would be that the Velcro swaddle had some loose strings (which as a sewist I know thats no big deal and is easy to miss). Also, the package had so much tape I had to cut it open. My upcoming two packages include some toys, yard supplies, and one electronic so if those are not acceptable I will update this review.Oh, and I forgot my biggest complaint is that they really blow you up if you consent to them sending you marketing information. I am very close to reporting the text as spam, but that won't prevent me from shopping with them again.",5,25/05/2024
"Honestly, for the price I expected somewhat sub-par products (quality and description).  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the products!  Whoever thinks they are getting top notch, expensive clothing for these prices are out of their mind.  I am very happy with shipping (lower costs with less waste), quality and description.  And, the return process was SO easy!!  Thank you TEMU!",5,25/05/2024
"I have never signed up to Temu and yet, somehow they have been sending me text messages, claiming I have a delivery coming for the last 3 days. I've never been on their website, never downloaded the app and certainly never opted into marketing from them. Be very careful as this feels like one huge brushing scam. I have now attempted to unsubscribe my phone number, despite never having actually subscribed. Let's see if it works. They're clearly not an ethical or law abiding company.",1,25/05/2024
Advert on Facebook (UK) with a product priced ??3.09 for new app users. I?€?m a new customer and downloaded the app as required. The price was ??30.49.,1,25/05/2024
After constantly seeing there adds on YouTube I fell into there trap and ordered some items I haven't received yet but that's not it I have a new phone and I haven't give out my number but I give my number to this account and within 5 hours I started receiving scam calls so they've sold my details on I've now deleted my account what a bunch of con artists don't trust this site.,1,25/05/2024
I joined this app through a post I had seen on fb. I have made money through referrals and made alot. I have so far had 5 orders delivered that haven't cost a penny. All delivered in a week and the quality of these items are spot on for what you are paying. Give it a go.,5,26/05/2024
"Temu- over aggressive advertising of poor products.2nd UPDATE Temu still continue to push their tat in my direction.I've never experienced a more aggressive marketing campaign.UPDATE: following MY original  post I got a further advertising/ promotion email from Temu. Read their response below, they are tone deaf to their actions. I want notifications from some brands, ones I like and respect. I don't want to turn off all notifications. Why can't Temu get the message- they push enough out.This company floods your email with their aggressive marketing,  no matter how many times you instruct Google to stop the adverts they just keep coming.It is an age old belief that only low quality products/ cheap products  need advertising. Good products speak for themselves and sell.Temp is pushing tat hard and I'm never going to engage.",1,26/05/2024
"I've had no issues with this company. I've placed multiple orders, and all have arrived on time,or if delayed, I've received $5 to spend on the app. All products have been in good condition and exactly what they look like on the site. Currently waiting on 3 more larger orders. Hopefully all will go well.",5,26/05/2024
"I had very good luck with the 2 orders I had. Today I making another order and there 5 items in my cart, ready to checkout and 2 items all of a sudden are sold out. Don?€?t understand so I will not order from this company again.",2,26/05/2024
Totally unbelievable sent my paid items to wrong address contacted them wasn't interested also putting free gifts around saying u can get ??50 off and get 5 free gifts if you get friends to download the app every time the download it you get money in credit trust me u get nothing at all big con so be aware stay away from this company,1,26/05/2024

"I actually have a few mini dresses from Temu and I love them! They're super cute and comfortable, and they're perfect for dressing up or down. I've worn them to parties, on dates, and even just for everyday wear. They're really versatile and they look great with different types of shoes and accessories. Overall, I'd definitely recommend them if you're looking for a cute and stylish mini dress!",5,26/05/2024
"I placed order Monday 1st May and received today Sunday 7th May. Everything I ordered was there, there was no missing items, all in good condition no damage. This was my first time ordering with this site with no problems so possibly may use again",4,26/05/2024
"Promises all these free prizes and chance to win credit, but you have to CONSTANTLY have people click on your link and sign up and it can only be people who have never used the app before, once someone has already used the app they can no longer help you, you also have a time limit for people to sign up and use your code or back to the start, you have to harass people essentially and it becomes almost impossible to actually gain the credit unless you know 100s of people, waste of time tbh",1,26/05/2024
Really disappointed in my experience. I ordered some makeup which almost all arrived broken because there was no protective packaging at all. I've bought from many other cheap shops and palettes are always in bubble wrap and have never arrived broken. Ordered some postcards which were almost folded in half. Thankfully I didnt spend much because by the time I repackaged and travel to the post office to make returns I will have spent half of anything I get refunded. I understand that things can get damaged but packed with zero care it's almost guaranteed and shows complete lack of regard for customers. Spent 3 hours on hold to report it to customer services and eventually gave up. Would never shop here again,1,26/05/2024
"First purchase, 5 items.I must say the products I ordered were better than expected given the price for each. I find the quality very good for the price I paid.Payment with Paypal was easy and delivery time was great. I actually received the package sooner than expected delivery date.Packaging could be a bit better,but all products arrived fine without any damages.Overall my experience was excellent ????.Thank you.",5,26/05/2024
"Hi I gave them low rating previously as could not resolve the issue now they have come back and have refunded. Thanks, Temu",5,26/05/2024
Your customer service has gotten  unbelievable.   You are losing customers including me.  I'm sorry I told friends and family to give you a try.,1,26/05/2024
I love love love Temu! I literally use to own nothing but pajama pants this store saved my life! The clothes are very good quality and so affordable! Customer service IS very polite they were able to fix my refund in less than 5 minutes! Currently waiting on my 10th order. Thank you Temu! ???,5,26/05/2024
"I don't get the negative reviews. I have placed 3 orders with them now, all over $100 each with multiple items. I received everything exactly as described, and everything worked and fit properly. A little advice: when buying clothes, look at the actual recorded measurements after you select a size, don't just select a size and go. Often, the recorded measurements are very different from the size selected, and all of my clothes fit near perfectly when I relied on those numbers.All of the electronics work exactly as described, also got some bike accessories that are quite decent.Not everything is super high quality, but there definitely are high quality items on this site. You have to be selective and compare pricing and products to other sites. Temu is like a mix between Amazon and AliExpress, without the scamming (not being able to tell something is low quality isn't exactly a scam on the company's part).All deliveries had proper tracking and 2 arrived within the delivery window, and the third was just a day late. Got a $5 coupon for waiting 24 hours extra for delivery, not bad at all!Haven't dealt with customer support yet, as I haven't had a reason to. Can't comment on that.All in all, I don't understand all the negative reviews. I have had an amazing experience so far, and have saved a ton of money to boot. I recommend this company!",5,26/05/2024
"Ordered items, received items in timely manners.  Items were as described.",5,26/05/2024
"I received a text confirmation of delivery of my package at 2:41pm, while I was waiting for delivery. I checked outside my door thinking the driver must have left the package without knocking, but it wasn't there. I looked for contact info in the text message and I saw the delivery details including the picture of confirmation. The delivery time was actually 1:40pm and the package was left outside of the back door of my apartment building. I immediately checked my (shipping) address to make sure I listed my apartment number. So why would it be acceptable to leave my package outside? The company's contact info is useless, I want to speak with a person not email or recorded messages. At this point I just really need my money back!!!",1,27/05/2024
Love Temu I always recieved my packages that I ordered Just made 3 more orders with them The Quality of the items I ordered were good Nothing damaged It only took a week to receive my orders,5,27/05/2024
"Very good, superb intro offer. Ordered 11 items came within 2 weeks all seem good for the price. I will probably be ordering again",5,27/05/2024
"Don?€?t fall onto this scam. I order about $39 of stuff I wanted to try it out and received a package that was clearly open, stuff stolen and replaced with a bunch of useless things. Contacted customer service which is useless because it?€?s a robot and the delivery company involved none of which would get back to me. I will never buy from them again and if you were smart you would not either.",1,27/05/2024
I will simply say please stay away from this Fraud company and it products.Customer Services is horrible as if you are speaking to somebody on a different planet and you ask them a question and reply is 180?? opposite to what you have asked.I will never ever place an order with them again.,1,27/05/2024
"Well I ordered 2 different times on April 29th,2023!! THE UPDATES THAT ARE BEING GIVEN TO ME ARE EXTREMELY VAGUE!!! I AM BEGINNING TO WONDER IF THIS COMPANY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GIVE ME MY STUFF!!! FIRST IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN BOSTON WHY DOES MY STUFF NEED TO CLEAR CUSTOMS!!??? 2ND YOU SAID MY PACKAGES WERE AWAITING FLIGHT FROM THE AIRPORT OK WHAT AIRPORT!!???? THEN YOU SAY OH IT ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT!! OK IT ARRIVED AT WHAT AIRPORT!!??? SO I AM THINKING THIS STUFF IS COMING FROM CHINA!!! IF IT COMES AT ALL!!!! THEN YOU GIVE ME A TRACKING NUMBER FOR THE USPS!!! BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO CHECK!!! IT SAYS PRE- SHIPMENT LABEL CREATED ON APRIL 29th!!! DON?€?T YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT FROM APRIL 29th!???  AND WHY WOULD THE PLANE LAND IN CAROL STREAM, IL!!??? I ONLY LIVE 1 HOUR FROM THERE!!! THESE UPDATES THAT ARE BEING SENT TO ME PERIODICALLY DO NOT MAKE SENSE!!!! WHY NOT MORE INFORMATION!!???  WHY DOES THE POST OFFICE NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION SINCE APRIL 29th!??  HOW CAN YOU TRACK A NUMBER IF NOONE HAS INFORMATION!!??? I ORDERED FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY YEARS AGO AND IT LANDED IN CAROL STREAM, IL AND I NEVER EVER RECEIVED IT!!!!

"I  received  my first  order  today, I didn't  order  anything  too expensive as I wanted to be cautious.  I  bought a T-shirt for my husband, I'm  pleased with the quality and the size  is just  right.  I  bought a small travel bag for myself and it seems well enough made, just what I wanted. The order arrived 3 days early, so that was good.  I've put in another  order so I'll let you know how I get  on, but all I can say at the moment is so far so good.  I'm pleased ???€",5,27/05/2024

"Zero if I could. They are using a courier that says they will deliver and don't. Tracking doesn't work. So go to customer support ...... well, 215th in the que ! Says it all really, only ordered a few things to start with and won't be ordering anything through them again. If they sort customer care, and deliveries out then maybe half useable. Better sticking to ebay or amazon.",1,27/05/2024
"If I could give zero I would. Attempted to make a purchase, it would not accept a PayPal payment, my first sign it was dodgy! Since then I have had multiple attempts to hack my personal email account. It appears to be a scam site or that are at least selling info on to hackers.",1,27/05/2024
I will actually give them zero as this is a follow up from my last review. I contacted their ?€?Customer Support ?€? which is the wrong name. When I contacted them on Monday they told me 24-48 hours and today being Friday I called them and they again said another 24-48 hours,1,28/05/2024
Absolutely fraud and don?€?t even think of falling into their trap at all. It?€?s such a bunch of fraudsters who either sell defective non functional products or even to make it more worse they even don?€?t have any customer service. Also these days to ?€?cut the cost?€? they have eliminated customer service person and started a method where you are compelled to CREATE A TICKET and then after few follow ups the ticket gets closed without any sort of resolution with some predrafted messages. In short it?€?s such a total fraud platform where you?€?ll surely be running into troubles and hassles and Ofcourse your hard earned money is at a stake. Be aware buyers don?€?t fall in trap of any flaw looking discounts or spinning wheels or any other foolish concepts they have on their marketplace. It?€?s all basically a trap to get your money in lieu of their crappy defective stuffs and to make it worse they even won?€?t sent them/meaning you even won?€?t receive it. If you read all the complaints here most of them are for non receipt of goods. So stay away and never even think of visiting or buying anything from here.,1,28/05/2024
"Zero stars!!  I ordered 2 wooden animal shaped puzzles with animal pieces for a 9 year old. I got 2 8"" square flimsy cardboard puzzles with cartoonish characters a 2 year old could have put together. I demanded a refund, they demanded I return the puzzles which weren't worth the cardboard they were on, they offered a fraction of what I had paid, I counter-offered, they agreed, but I have never received a penny.",1,28/05/2024
"With all the bad reviews, I was skeptical about ordering. A month ago I made a small order, 2 weeks I received exactly what I had ordered. Since then I have larger orders and so far no problems. Pleased with what I am receiving. It's no Macy's Fifth Avenue, but it is very practical for the price. Thank you Temu.",4,28/05/2024
"Zero stars. So cunning. I feel like I'm in an app that constantly sends me spyware. Ridiculous. Deceiving. Shady. Very unprofessional. Since all you want is more app download, that's all you're going to get. Because on the long run, nobody wants to do business with scammers like you! Ridiculous!",1,28/05/2024
Temu is doing very well with delivering service. Thank you for your great customer service.,5,28/05/2024
"They deliver fine and the products I got are quite good quality. However, it happens they change the pricing while the item is still in your cart and your shopping.I wanted to order a memory foam bath math priced 0,89 cents. When i went to pay for it, it was priced 2,89. I think it's a really bad customer experience and feels they are trying to rip you off while you're ordering.",3,28/05/2024
"I have ordered a lot from Temu and I have received a lot of damaged items. Any metal pictures I have ordered are always bent. They are usually fixable until the last 2 and both were bent completely up on the ends. I have have had 2 insulated cups arrive damaged. They are great about replacing items, giving credit or refunding money. It gets to be a bit much when it seems like at least one thing is damaged in every shipment. It's really inconvenient if something is a gift due in a certain time frame. I ordered lids to replace the broken ones on the water cups and I think that is my last order. They need much improved shipping containers and boxes. A plastic bag which is all they seem to use offers no protection for the merchandise",3,28/05/2024
"I've ordered from Temu and haven't had a problem with delivery. Of course some items look great on the app but are cheap. However, I ordered phone charges, planters, couch cushion covers and a bathroom floor mat, flip flops and I've received everything within 7-10 days",5,28/05/2024
Spent 192 dollars on temu they already took the money out of my account but they are trying to say I don't have ownership of my card so I did all that I can do to verify my order and they are still claiming it's not my account but they already took my money and won't refund it!! Very unhappy will never shop here again!!!,1,28/05/2024
"I was extremely disappointed with my products, in my personal opinion, the clothing quality is the worst I have ever experienced.  I ordered several clothing pieces that I don?€?t have the heart to even donate, they will go in the trash. DO NOT SHOP IN TEMU, it is not worth your time. The only thing good was the on time delivery.",1,28/05/2024
"Shopping with them in general wasn't bad, they have a lot of nice products?€?my concern is the app itself. USA Today posted an article by a cybersecurity expert who said it's dangerous because it's spyware. I don't feel safe using it anymore.",2,28/05/2024

"Boy after reading all the negative reviews, I am here to say I received what I ordered, same items that I have seen advertised for 3 - 4 times the price. Any differences were due to me not checking the size. Only thing I would comment on is the poor packaging, however, nothing has arrived broken, just incredibly ugly packages. I received items quickly with good tracking info. Not sure what everyone is grumbling about, read the descriptions, check the size, blow up the photos, take a good look at the merchandise. I have no idea how they do it, but I feel I have cut out numerous middlemen for items I would have purchased anyway.",5,28/05/2024
"Ordered a number of small items from Temu which came on time.  However, the items were not packed appropriately, e.g. a pack of 3xcraft tapes were stacked/squashed/damaged, ring size adjuster (foams were squashed/damaged), deformed aluminium tape roll, etc.  Also, 80% of the 20 items bought are not of good quality, thus I didnt really grabbed a ""bargain"" & as the saying goes...""I got what I've paid for"".",1,28/05/2024
I'd like to return packages to temu to recieve my credit back but it asked me to give it to ups or Canada post. My last return it told me a could keep the package. Is there anyway to do that with my 2 recent packages? I want a return not a refund,3,28/05/2024
I read the bad review in the beginning but decided to try it for myself. I have now ordered 3 or 4 times. I am happy with everything. I got dog clothes. Some were only 1.88 or so and on ebay and amazon they are 9 10 or higher. I got a little washer. It is a folding type little bucket you fill with water and turn on and it is wonderful for my dogs clothes. It would be great for any hand wash item. I am so happy with this company that I wish other people would try it and not just rely on bad reviews that some of them do not even sound like they ordered anything from this company. Not only that but Temu tells you every single step of the way what your order is doing including the flight to the US. Everything is updated 2  or 3 times a day. You can not ask for better than this.,5,28/05/2024
"Flea market quality of items, some not worth the advertised price. Overseas items according to Temu's detailed tracking. Washed the polo shirt and the stitching has started coming apart, I haven't even worn it yet. The watch is pretty to look at, but lost one minute of time in just 24 hours. The The sunglasses are probably the only items actually valued as advertised, none worth more than five dollars. But do not get the motorcycle glasses because they are not impact resistant and are not safe for riding.",2,28/05/2024

Which is not at all what I was supposed to get and I even read the rules before hand to be clear before I purchased. This is my first time shopping from Temu after hearing all the rave about it and also my last because I don?€?t like to be mislead when I?€?m spending my hard earned money.

"Recently, I have starting purchasing items on line via TEMU, and each item purchased was listed as a viable price and purchase.  When items that I purchased were delivered, I was extremely pleased with the items purchased.  In addition, if you download the app, you can track each item that you purchased until it is delivered.",5,29/05/2024
"I stayed on phone in their ?€?queue chat?€? for almost teo hours, cant get anyone to answer the phone. They must be a business that runs out of a car or something. Sent me a camera with no instructions no uid number no ip address. And they wont refund. Something has to be done to shut thia down",1,29/05/2024
The stuff I received was ok but you get what you pay for lower quality items but ok. I won?€?t buy anything else.,3,29/05/2024
"Wow what a great company.  Ordered on the 26th April and arrived at my door on the 3rd May. Both my orders were put in together, very well packaged.  Highly recommend Temu.",5,29/05/2024
Items were as described and arrived within a week. Definitely buying from them again,5,29/05/2024
"My very first order was taking weeks. Checking the Temu website?€?s tracking, it was in transit, but without locations provided. But when I checked with FedEx directly through the link provided by Temu, a packing label had been printed but nothing had ever been given to FedEx.  The last activity on the  FedEx site was 12 days prior, and confirmed nothing had ever been shipped. When I waited for over an hour to chat with a representative with Temu, they continually directed me to their tracking, which offered no insight because it was not consistent with the shipper?€?s tracking. The service rep refused to check the FedEx tracking page, so I took and sent screenshots. The rep kept repeating that I had to wait another few days to claim a refund, refused to look at my screenshots of FedEx and declined to explain why these two sets of tracking information were completely different. The rep declined over and over to provide a refund, despite it being clear that nothing had even been shipped with FedEx. I repeatedly asked for a refund. Toward the end of the interaction the rep admitted that they had not even viewed my screenshots. I waited for over an hour to chat online with someone who wasn?€?t reading anything i wrote. Everything was copy pasted. They insisted at least twice that my package had been delayed in order ?€?package your items very carefully?€?. I was so aggravated by the end of this conversation I stoped being nice about it, told them they were offering horrible service, and demanding my refund repeatedly. He repeated that I must get back in touch in a few days, to spend an hour and a half of my time again to get a refund on an item that never shipped. I have a lot of patience, but this was next level. After all of that they refunded my 40 dollars, and being left with zero incentive to do business with Temu again, I decline to make any further purchases. FIRST TIME customer!!! Temu's response below is similarly tone deaf and copy and pasted, just like in live chat with their agents. Note that they never account for the shipping tracking discrepancies, never acknowledge that my package was never received by the shipper, never address the behaviour of their agents, or the company's apparent inability to effectively ship products to their clients in Canada.I am far from alone. This experience was unnecessarily complicated, aggravating and a waste of my time, money, and energy. And all of this over less than $40. Shame on Temu.",1,30/05/2024
"I highly enjoy their products and shipping times. I'm just wondering why I have an allergic reaction to the packaging? When I get a package in, my eyes and sinus cavity feel like they are on fire for a few days. Has anyone else had this problem?",4,30/05/2024

"I wanted to write this review for other people who want an honest and thought filled response to ""Is Temu worth my time, and is it legit?"".  Please bare with me for this reply. TLDR: Temu is a relatively trust worthy site from what I have seen based on my experiences.  Not everyone will have the same experience, purchase with caution but the site is not as sketchy as some others and your items will be a decent quality in most cases and come on time or sooner.  (NOTHING LIKE WISH.COM WAS)-----------------------------------------------------------I was highly skeptical of this site at first due to as many of you can probably remember... Wish.com HA.  My sister told me about the site in early March, telling me about all of the items she had purchased many of being ""free"" and she had got me some I would like as well.  Which to me was a super red flag, so my response was ""You will see those items in 3-4 months or your will not receive them.  Low and behold, two weeks later she was giving me the ""free items"" she ordered.  Which was honestly a shock.  I did not order anything from the site until the beginning of April when two coworkers told me about this same site and how everything was so cheap and they actually got their items on time.  So it was time for me to see for myself.  My first order was around $40, which was for four dress shirts that elsewhere would have been around $80 - $90.  A steal honestly so finding out if this site was legit for that prioce couldn't hurt, along with being able to use Afterpay, Klarma, and Paypal isn't to bad (seeing these three third party options as a way to purchase these items eased my mind a bit.)  So I ordered, and I waited.  I got my items 8 days later, and the quality shocked me.  All but one were genuinely like what I had reviewed before purchase.  True to size, all and all I loved them and I wear them to work.  One of the items however not at all like the photo (it was a shirt, but came in super large and more like a dress), it was still nice and super cute to wear as a sundress for a day out.  I was not disappointed.Ok, I am sold.  I order more items, this time, 5 shirts, three pairs of shorts, and a sun hat. All for $60.  I ordered them on April 20th, it said they would be here by April 28th - May 2nd (today).  My whole order came by the 26th.  Everything was great, true to size.  I have no complaints.  I really recommend this site to people who are looking for decently priced items.  Though that does not mean everything on this site is legit (I mean this as not everything will come exactly like the photos but for the most part it does), as I have only really order clothing items.  So I would still proceed with caution on other items.  But for clothes I give it a 8/10.Edit: I have ordered some more items of which again came on time, three pairs of shoes, a carry on bag for plane travel and some luggage locks.  Everything came and is great.  I just made another purchase yesterday I am waiting on to arrive.  I don?€?t know if my luck is just insane or is other people are just not taking caution when ordering.",4,30/05/2024
have tried to contact temu for the last 4 days went to chat and called but NO I MEAN NO response so i am returning... i wanted to replace a top i bought for $2.54 for a smaller size but when i went to the web site to reorder it the right size it was for $8.08 so i tried to get a price adjustment and they showed me another top..i have tried for over an hour with the phone number TWICE  and with the chat and sent about 9 tickets....i have one more order and then iam done with TEMU....need to have representatives to talk to customers....bad bad place and i have found out their clothes aren't true to nothing and they do not last....,1,30/05/2024

Well Temu you exceeded my expectations! I ordered my items less than a week ago and the delivery date was estimated for the 3rd - 5th of May. It arrived today..

"This site has been quite frustrating to use. It's great that there are opportunities to win free products and discounts, however there are only so many referrals one can make  that it seems a little unrealistic. I understand their tactic to have more people join which is smart, but referring and sending links over and over again is a little ridiculous and quite annoying.

"I'm surprised at how well it turned out. I was prepared for a bad experience. I ordered some large size ladies clothes, the order took about 9 days. So far, everything looks great. I have yet to wash anything, so maybe they'll fall apart, but straight out of the package, the sizing is good and the quality looks fine. I did not order things that were two or three dollars, more like $15, so maybe the negative reviews are because people are ordering things where the price is too good to be true.",5,31/05/2024

"They lure you in with something at a very discounted price, but the things you have to buy  at a markup to make the minimum cost for shipping kinda equalizes it. Don?€?t get me wrong, overall it?€?s still good prices.. but the first impression is misleading.",4,31/05/2024
"I have ordered 12 times from Temu.  The only negative thing I can say is that the orders take some time but every time they are late, I have received a $5 credit so I am giving them 5 stars. I have compared prices with other companies and Temu is always substantially cheaper.It's important to read the size charts before ordering along with customer reviews on the products, but returning items is very easy.  You can disable notifications but check your coupons/credits often because I have had some nice surprises in there.  Be patient when waiting for your orders and you will become addicted to this site.",5,31/05/2024
"If you use the site correctly in the sense if keeping your expectations in line with prices and limit the scope of products that can be good for such low prices, then you will not be disappointed. I think too many shoppers expect too much for so small a price on many items. Stay with the things you know such as paint rollers, drill accessories, sponges, the real basics. I have saved quite a bit of money instead of getting these at the big box stores.",5,31/05/2024

"Ive ordered from Temu before, it worked out great but until recently I?€?ve made a $100 order that got marked delivered when I looked it wasn?€?t, I contacted Costumer multiple times asking for help with a refund and all they keep doing is declining and saying that it got delivered over and over. This has been going on for days and still haven?€?t got any help. Iam chatting them as well I write this and they responded with the same ?€?it has been delivered check around ur house?€? message in attempts to push this further I kept chatting and now they won?€?t even respond even though the chat is still open and going. It?€?s a shame that so many people liked this app and now they can?€?t do simple things. The worse part is that under there purchase protection program this should be covered meaning I should get a refund but every time I tell them that they skip over it or send the same delivered message.Edit:I?€?ve already contacted the carrier and they said to contact temu in order to resolve the issue as it has been delivered to my house, as I told temu support it has not, and I?€?ve still not got the help I needed, I waited in a damn Que for 3 hours just for them to say the same thing and still not give help, the worse part is, is that under there protection program I should get a.

I order a pair of sandals from them. First time using this company. Took almost 2 weeks to get the shoes. When I got them. They were the wrong size. I order a 14 and they sent me a 13. My order clearly said 14. Extremely dissatisfied. I feel like they just stole my money. Sent me something I can't used. Now they expect me to wait a month for a refund. No thanks. I will donate the shoes. You can keep the money. I will never order from them again.,1,01/06/2024

For example, I want only cotton clothing, not polyester. There is always a place to click to get more info. There I can find out what the fabric is. Terrific buys on shoes. Would give 5 stars but for the fact that they say all returns are free. You don?€?t have to pay for shipping to return an item, but it is for an adjusted credit amount (slightly less than what you paid that may cover shipping costs).  There is print somewhere that says that but I only recently noticed it. Overall, I am very satisfied with Temu.",4,01/06/2024
Good Morning everyone have many orders and getting a little nervous as my tracking information doesn't match the delivery. Called FedEx and Canada and they have NOT received my package . Found the customers service number 1-857-302-1192 and the agent said free call no charge . Provided all my order numbers and all orders have shipped and all at customs clearance so the date is for when the package will be released and then I can track Canada post and FedEx to see when my package will be delivered . He name is ARA she was great customer service . And said to call if the packages have not been received by the date to get my 5 dollar credit on all my orders .

About 70 to 80% of the stuff that you receive from them is nothing but pure junk. Then they want you to go to the post office to send it back to them. They want me to pay 6.99 to send back item that cost two dollars. So if you return it you are 4 dollars in the hole. They do not take into consideration if you are a disabled veteran and unable to just get up and go to the post office. I would definitely not recommending buying anything from this company.

I recieved my first 2 orders the bad looked like they were opened and taped back up the boxes were mangled. I'm waiting for my next 2 orders which I've been trying to get and answer for why they have been in one place at the airport for 6 day's now and some bogus response saying it's on it's way. Have been given 2 phone numbers for customer service and neither worked. I'm shocked that a company can get away with this. Buyer beware!!!,2,02/06/2024
I have been using the app mainly for referral bonuses so far have made 150 into my bank account (they transfer to PayPal) No I?€?m not an Indian prince scammer just a normal person taking advantage of ?€?free money?€? It was a super easy process and easy to use.Super impressed with the feature available. I haven?€?t ordered anything from site so can?€?t give a recommendation on their items.,5,02/06/2024
"Spammed with this sale and that giveaway, I was finally suckered into buying a ""Nintendo Switch Joycon"" for only $4.  It was advertised on Temu as being a legit controller manufactured by Nintendo.  Weeks later when it finally arrived it was just some cheap Chinese knockoff.  I didn't even bother syncing it up with my Switch.  I instead synced it up with the trash.Avoid this bs, shady company.  They lie.  Period.(reply)It doesn't matter if I can apply for a refund.  This was a PROMOTION SPECIFICALLY DONE BY YOU, and it was a lie.  How are you going to act like you can cover that up by replying some automated response to me here.  It was false advertisement, in a promotional sale that YOU (Temu) directly put out into the world, claiming that you were selling OFFICIAL Nintendo Switch Joycons, for a limited time offer of $4 so long as the customer downloaded your app.  It was a blatant lie.  But because you have some silly refund policy, everything is supposed to be okay?  No.  You're a shady company, and truth be told...  I'm starting to believe all you guys were after in the end was our personal information.  Well...  I'm a poor nobody.  Enjoy my information.NO ONE SHOULD EVERY SHOP / SUPPORT TEMU.",1,02/06/2024

I ordered items months ago and I have not received any of the things I ordered. I Now understand why the products are cheap because you don't get them! After reading other reviews I understand why. A scam site for sure and I will let all my friends on social media know to NEVER buy from this site. I read other reviews and there are so many who have experienced the same thing. How are they allowed to do business?,1,03/06/2024

I'm very disappointed in temu. They trick people into thinking that the gifts are free when you have to invite new users people hence promoting their business! But at the same time Jamaicans cannot claim these advantages because even if you get your whole household and friends to download the app they can't benefit and neither can you. It's just frustrating and unfair. Dear owner you need to do better and get Jamaicans involve because we are more than half of your supporters. Jamaicans love to shop online and you guys are not giving us any form of chance to do so whether for the free gifts (which are not free) to inviting people and why is it that people have to invite new users for everything!!!!!! Oh come on ppl be realistic.,1,03/06/2024
"I didn't receive a few of my orders due to OOS...I received my $$ back. A few weeks later, I received my order at NO CHARGE!  Not many Companies do that.  I gotten lots of free gifts, $5 refunds due to delays, and money was always refunded.  I use PayPal to protect myself and yes, a lot of it is cheaper products.  I just watch the dimensions on each item, because some things are smaller than they appear.  I have a whole new wardrobe of Summer tops and tees.  Thin material but when most tops are an average of $5 a piece, so what if they don't last a long time. I love their tees!  So soft, and I love all the sayings on them.  I order mostly kitchen items and things we can use in our camper.  I'm finished ordering for awhile....but I would order again.",5,03/06/2024

"Terrible, terrible packaging! Sent everything in some orange bag with tape all over it. Boxes were crushed and damaged!

There's no way to contact the carrier and phone calling takes forever. If they were to at least refund me or send me my items then I would think about buying from them again but they didn't even try. Is there a way to contact a different customer support worker?Edit: I got my refund. Thank you Temu. Sorry for my harsh words.",5,04/06/2024
"Their stuff is amazing and quick delivery,BUT the second time I ordered stuff, the left it downstairs in my condo lobby,where anyone could have taken it. Why did the carrier NOT deliver to my suite.",3,04/06/2024
"I did not receive any emails regarding my order (It's a shared order, 11 items totaling $76.26), nor did they pack an order list along with my parcel so I could verify the items and the prices, so that I could calculate how much the other party owe me. And I did not get any late delivery credit!",1,04/06/2024
"I have never received the order, I contacted customer service they said they assign someone to me, the lady closed my cases without telling me or ask me anything, she said it was delivered to the right address, if it was delivered to a right address why would I be contacting, where is the purchase protection that I seen from your website advertised, so it fake ?

"I had three orders w a temu of about 60 items - one order was many socks to give to a local homeless shelter. other orders were for misc items for house, car, clothing, kitchen etc. every aspect of doing business via their app was totally satisfactory. no problems, no glitches.great technology to track items and return as well. I had one of three sweatshirts I ordered that I just didn't like the style so I requested to return it. I instantly got an email telling me that I would get a credit on my PayPal (which I did in two days) and to keep, give away or recycle the product. no need to return.everything was legit and easy to do business with. their prices are very low and you just need to recognize that shipping, if from china, takes some time. my longest wait was less than two weeks. the quality of the 3 sweatshirts and dozens of socks was fine. so I was wrong. I thought that if it was too good to be true it's not true. well it's true.Sam Marcus",5,04/06/2024
"So I have received my first package from a TEMU order. I admit I bought a lot of little stuff to try it out. This first package had lightbulbs (5) with other stuff and I must say that the care of quality in packaging is non-existent. Two bulbs were just smashed throughout and the rest of the stuff appeared to be undamaged. Now. The cost of the bulbs was cheap so I made no claim and just cleaned the shards of glass off the rest of the stuff in the 30+ piece package?€? (some things were bent but I could straighten them) so needless to say?€? if you want crap stuff that does the trick for why you buy it and you don?€?t care what company you buy from?€? then TEMU is for you. I can say that this experience was nostalgic but it will not happen again.So far a 4. No clothing ordered or shoes, just gadgets and kitchen items etc?€? I will try to review again sfter I see the quality and functionality of the gadgets. First order placed today. This could be my GO TO for trinkets, golf tees, and little stuff!! So damn cheap. Let?€?s see how the quality is when I receive my first order of $130.00",2,04/06/2024
"I placed two orders with Temu. One on April 7 and the other on April 8. The delivery dates were between April 15-19 and 16-20. I kept getting messages that they were out for delivery twice a day. I received a message on April 21 that there was a problem verifying the shipping address by Canada Post. The parcels were being returned to sender. Although I did get my money refunded back into my bank account today, I will never purchase another thing from Temu and highly recommend avoiding this scamming company.",1,04/06/2024
"I ordered several items. 2 were happy faced novelty plant pots, 2 were soft gnome kitchen themed decor pieces, and a pair of embroidered slingback sandals.The planter pots were much smaller than what they seemed to be in the items picture, but I was careful to scan the full item description and ALL of the pictures shown. One of the pictures included a picture of the pots WITH very clear measurements, so I was not surprised at all by their size. They are absolutely adorable and exactly what I expected. They were well packaged and arrived in perfect condition. The gnome decorations are super cute and seem to be well made. The quality of the stitching and materials is very good. They also came in with no rips tears or soiling. The shoes are absolutely beautiful. The embroidery is well done without any loose threads or mis-stiching. They also were well packaged and arrived without scuffs or damage. The size was correct, they fit well, and they are comfortable. The pictures were super accurate as to the design and colors. The only thing that could have been improved upon was the slingback faux leather strap. It feels a bit flimsy and I am concerned as to how well the strap will hold up. After examining the strap closely it does appear that it could be replaced fairly easily though, should the need arrise.They were accurately described as faux leather, so again I absolutely knew what I was getting. All in all I was super pleased with the quality and my overall purchase. I have shopped at several different little overseas sites, and received the wrong items, items of poor quality, items that just were not what was described or pictured, and of course items that simply never showed up. Receiving packages from other sites has usually taken 6weeks or longer. The expectation Temu set was several weeks as well. So, needless to say, I was super shocked to receive a text saying my package had been delivered AFTER ONLY 5 BUSINESS DAYS!!!!!I was one happy shopper! I will definitely be willing to order from Temu again. The prices were great and I think as long as you read the descriptions well and look at all the pictures you will do pretty well with Temu. I think that keeping in mind the price and setting your expectations with clear product descriptions is super important. Don't assume details that aren't written. Check the sizing guides and the reviews too! Happy shopping!",5,04/06/2024
"Temu has some good values on the RC toys and electronics components we've purchased so far but they need to take a lesson from Amazon on how to pack and ship. The radio control toys we ordered came in the manufacturer's flimsy plastic/cardboard display boxes wrapped only in an orange plastic bag. One Work Team RC toy we got this week was the wrong item in the right flimsy box, which was crunched in shipping. (Muliple items on one web age can be confusing.) Ironically, returns to Temu have to go back to them in a  UPS standard box, which would be totally unneccesary if they had just shipped all items in an appropriate box in the first place.  There is no UPS pickup for returns, so they have to be dropped at a UPS store before a long delayed refund is issued. And, as in almost everything purchased from China, instructions for English-speaking customers are tiny and the translations often make no sense whatsoever. The prices are right, but Temu is the poster company for the old adage that ""you get what you pay for"".",2,04/06/2024
"I tried to order an item and it stated free shipping until I entered my credit card info and then it stated there was a $20.00 mininum order .  I can understand charging shipping but it should be stated up front not wait until checkout.  I won,t be ordering from a company that does that",1,04/06/2024
"I recently tried Temu and I have to say that it's definitely not a scam. The platform is really fun and addicting, and I found myself spending hours browsing and looking at different products. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of five is because of the scummy attempts to lure people into getting free products. While I did eventually receive my ""free"" RC Truck, the process was slow and frustrating. They made it seem like I would get it quickly, but then slowed things down at the last minute, forcing me to invite friends or buy products in order to receive my ""free"" item. However, overall I would still recommend Temu as a great way to discover new products and have some fun in the process. Just beware of these free gifts!",3,04/06/2024
I?€?ve been an independent jeweler for the last 15 years and I see a lot of familiar work on Temu sold for a dollar or two. The photographs are stolen from real artists and I don?€?t know what you could possibly receive for a dollar and free shipping. The site has no respect for intellectual property and is obviously fraudulent. There?€?s no way I found to report these fake sellers on the site.,1,04/06/2024
"I downloaded the app like a week ago. The amount of spam calls and messages I?€?m getting is crazy. I got woken up by all these strange numbers every morning for the past five days and all of them left the same voice message in Chinese saying press 9 for some stupid ass customer service I didn?€?t request. Today I got bombarded by three phone calls nonstop in the morning and I?€?m sick of it and it?€?s not letting me update my phone number unless I put another phone number with a verification code dude this is insane? I have no control over my personal information!! So I deleted my account and then I receive an email saying my account will be deleted in 7 business days BUT ?€? We may be required to retain certain information for legal, regulatory, tax, security, integrity, or compliance reasons for a limited period of time, after which it will be deleted.?€? OH MH LORD PLZ I wanted to buy your stuff but I DO NOT LIKE GETTING THESE SPAM CALLS DUDE WTH?

"Good service so far.  I haven't had many problems with Temu.  I don't pay them directly, I go thru Paypal.  The only problems I have had is that one of my gloves had a rip in it, I got half of my money back, a pair of shoes I wanted were not available, got my money back.  Was able to order those shoes and they were too big (size 8) gave them away to co-worker.  I have another pair and those fit.  I have purchased other shoes, yes they are plastic but they work.  They do smell but that is temporary.  I guess what also works for me is that I do not purchase over $30, I use coupons when I get them and I purchase a lot of kitchen stuff",5,05/06/2024
temu is a great app too order from but the shoes arent like what you see but thats it the smart watches are so cheap and they work so well i ordered a smart watch and and coffee mixer the coffee and a purse and so necklaces and rings and they were so prettyyy the coffee mixer wouldnt start at fist then it worked fine order here NOT THE SHOES!!!!!!!!,5,05/06/2024
Items are not good quality..takes a long time to get the orders.too many notifications.advertises free shipping but after your first order has a minimum for free shipping.,3,05/06/2024
Temu seems to be a scam company they took my money then suspended my orders I have called customer support and even emailed them to no avail  no one knows what's going on. Then they send me a partial order and try to play it off as an error I'm assuming but suspended the rest of my orders,1,05/06/2024
"False advertising. Online says free shipping on all orders; when you go to check out says $20 minimum. Product description poor; for instance, sizes S, M, L; however, doesn't state corresponding measurements; search function poor; for instance, cannot search out ""wide width"" for shoes. Complete waste of time trying to put together an order. My conclusion; they'll take customer money; I'm leery Id ever get my order anyway. I cancelled my attempted order and will never attempt to order again. Waste of time.",1,05/06/2024

"The best online shopping app by far! You cannot beat their prices and quality, and do not let me start on the variety of items they have! I can understand that not everything will be 100% amazing quality, but you can?€?t expect that and at the same time pay something a dollar or so, plus there are reviews so you can always check the reality of their products. So people who have only negative things to say I feel like their points are not valid. The ones who expect to get everything for free and based on that only leave a 1 star review are not being fair nor realistic. Temu is killing it honestly! They are on top of their game so far! Keep going like this!",5,05/06/2024
the quality of goods is actually better than I expected (compare to any dollar store).  And free shipping.wide variety goods while OZ retailers only sell limited high margin items.  all my orders delivered within 2 weeks.Already hooked to it (that's the only downside),5,05/06/2024

I've been shopping on Temu sine November 2022. Every other I've gotten is always correct. Cloth's are well made. You have to make sure to check if the size you are ordering is what your body measurements are on the guide. That's where people make mistakes. Some things run big and some small. I personally would not try to buy intimate items because you can't return them. The household items I've bought I look at reviews and if I see satisfaction in the comments I give the item a try. 9.5 out of 10 the item is well made and works as it should. Give TEMU a try lots of their stuff is really handy that you didn't know you needed it until you buy it.,5,05/06/2024
Temu asked for me to verify my card that I used by sending a Pic of the last 4 digits I used so I did. Then they said they couldn't verify me &asked me to send a statement. I told them I am not sending them a bank statement & they should not be asking people for information like that!!,1,05/06/2024
I downloaded the App and became very disappointed. It offered me free gifts. It told me to pick out two in which I did. Than it asked me to share my link with a friend. Well guess what. In order to receive a free gift the people you sent the link to much download the link. It never said for a free gift you must do this nor did it say they must download the link. This is a scam to get more customers. Be honest about your promotions for free gifts. We all know that nothing in life is free. I only gave it a one star because I couldn't give it zero. I said what I had to say. There is nothing you can offer me to change my mind. Stop with the cover ups. False Advertisement is just what it is!!,1,05/06/2024
We are very happy with Temu! We like computer memory and everything else!!,5,05/06/2024
"The order came, alhtough a day late. It is coming from China, so it takes a while. The products are low quality, but may do in a pinch. The wallet was from a cheap plastic that smelled and was oily, the knock-off tracking tiles didn't work, but the electronic thermometer was fine. What I don't like is that somehow they seem to preferrably display the positive reviews and are very keen on parsing even reviews on Trustpilot. I had to supply order number information or my review here will be deleted. I will not order anything again, for me it's just not worth it, I don't think I will be able to use most of the products, definitely not the tracking tiles (will hopefully be refunded) and not the purse. I washed it twice but I feel I get an oily chemical residue on my fingetrs from it. I applied for refund for the tracking tiles.",2,05/06/2024
"Delivered my package to NY NOT NHTamu, who decided to ship package using some shipping service I never heard of; who does not respond either!I opened a case Tamu closed stating to call shipper which I did and still no response!!Refund my money!!!!",1,05/06/2024
"I recently had a terrible experience with Temu. I placed an order for some items and was promised a specific shipping date, but not only did they miss that date, they completely lost my shipment! At first, they tried to lie and say that the items were out of stock, but eventually, they admitted that they had lost the shipment altogether.To make matters worse, they refused to disclose where my items were or what they were doing to try to locate them. Instead, they offered me credit to their store in an attempt to get me to buy more from them despite their inability to even make a simple shipment.To add insult to injury, I waited for a month and 7 days, and my items never arrived. It's clear that Temu has no regard for its customers or their satisfaction. I would not recommend doing business with this company, as their lack of responsibility and transparency is simply unacceptable. Save yourself the headache and shop elsewhere.Update:After they saw this review they tried to take it down unless an order number was provided. I did provide them with one. They tried offering me $30 credit to their store AGAIN! They still have no clue that I don't ever want to buy with them anymore for multiple reasons. 1. Their customer service is awful.2. Their products never arrived after a month and 7 days. And if I didn't ask where they were they would have just let it be.3. Their refund hasn't arrived yet.4. They lied when asked and never gave an answer to where my products were. 5. Their customer service Mathers and Kersen were dismissive and offer the classic I'm sorry they were trained for but no real answers or satisfactory resolution. Of course, they are scared to death of reviews like mine. And they will continue to push their narrative, but they are a scam. They kept saying that they are not but when you promise something that you can't deliver and you don't do anything to solve the situation A MONTH AND 7 DAYS AFTER  you are by definition running a scam.UPDATE: July 1st, 2023They never refunded me for the products I purchased. Steer away from this company if you don't want to lose your money. This is the biggest scam ever.",1,05/06/2024
The whole idea of this app is that you can get items for cheap. But what they don't tell you is that you have to spend at least $10 in order to actually purchase anything. You may as well go on Amazon and buy something for under $10 instead of paying over $10 on the scam that is temu.,2,05/06/2024
I am addicted to this site.  Never had a problem with shipping or timing of shipment.  Have only purchased baby clothes but the quality of the product is amazing.  I love this place and have turned many friends onto it as well.,5,06/06/2024

Keep up to the good work!",5,06/06/2024
"So I?€?ve ordered over 400 dollars worth the stuff from Temu. I have to return a lot of it because the quality is terrible. But the few items that are good are perfectly fine. Unfortunately most of the time it?€?s crap. I?€?ve tried 3 times over the past two days to get in touch with them via Temu live chat, the first time I was number 900 something in line so obviously that took hours. The second time I was 832 in line?€?. Took hours. And this morning I am number 253 in line. What is going on? Anyway if you use this app don?€?t expect anything better than wish. You get what you get. Be warned. The custom service doesn?€?t help if you can even get ahold of them",2,06/06/2024

"Temu has been very honest. I get my orders on time, with several alerts along the way to let me know their status. When I have issues, they are quick to resolve them. I am surprised to see so many negative reviews. Some of the products you get aren't top quality, but I haven't gotten any junk. They have a good variety of nice items to choose from",5,06/06/2024
Every time I went to checkout it tells me I haven't spent enough for this that or the other promotion. I got sick and tired of it and closed out. What a waste of time.Edit: I wish I had known beforehand that if the 30% off code drops you back below $20 you can't put your order through. I wouldn't have wasted so much time on the site.,1,06/06/2024
"Watch out. There is something shady going on with the first purchase discount scheme. Let me explain.  I downloaded the app due to the heavy discounts shown on advertisements. I put my order and they gave me a tracking number for AUSPOST. However, this where the shady part happens. The item gets a delivery notification, and soon after I get another text message from temu (no less than 2 minutes later) that the item failed to deliver. At this time I rechecked the shipping label and it says it was successfully delivered to PADSTOW (not my address). I clearly did put my address in the shipping information when I ordered. How come Temu knows so quickly that it failed to deliver to my actualaddress? Why has Auspost stated 'successful'delivery to an address different to my own?On top of that, At the end they offer a refund - but it was misleading. Instead of transfering the funds to your bank account, they gave credit on the site (now full price on those items I orded). Those items are now available at a much higher price than I purchased..The only reasonable and sound explanation i can think of is that the first heavy discount is incorrectly shipped to an address known to Temu (maybe to local warehouse). It then deliberately informs the customer that their shipping failed right after 'delivery'. It's a very sly ploy to give discounts without the product and then storing that credit on the person's account. This is one sly tactic to attract a user to sign up without giving them the said discounts.Temu, I'd like an actual refund into my backaccount not your site.Edit: Temu has replied, but has not addressed my questions. 1. Why was the package shipped elsewhere? 2. Why does Auspost claim successful delivery at PADSTOW? Why isn't my address viewable on the auspost tracker? How come you claimed that my delivery was unsuccessful prior to AUSPOST determining it? Isn't the courier the first one to know about the item's whereabouts?",1,06/06/2024
It has been a pleasant surprise that the 2 orders I made was sent promptly and received (in less that 12 days) all the way from China. The items arrived safely and as described. I have since placed 2 more orders as their prices are very competitive. I was also kept well informed of the transit of said orders and delivered by NZ Post with tracking numbers,4,06/06/2024
sent me what i believe to be fake merchandise..... 2x shure sm57 microphones ....... send me real 1's ..... these units are well under the official weight of real shure's units ...... this is false advertising and fraud. please correct this situation for me. thanks .,1,06/06/2024
"I ordered things for photoshoot that I really needed for my photoshoot as a photographer and they never came. As someone on the budget it was the best option. Package is in transit for more than two weeks. The deliver company indicates that they have not receive the package yet. I'm sad because I needed those things and I still want them. The 5 $ store credit for ""late delivery"" is not enough for my opinion.",1,06/06/2024
You show a product with a low price But when I go to order it I find out that the price posted is for a lower quantity item? I don't think that's a fair way to do business. It's just makes me not want to purchase it.,1,06/06/2024
"I Love the App the price is right and so is the product , you get what you See, I have been shopping there for a few months and everything I have order and received has been a good product and looks or not better than the pictures. It's a awesome site fill with everything you could ever want. Delivery is not bad never. It's a Really Good Site.",5,06/06/2024
"Sort of legitimate scam. All discounts, gifts, freebies are not real.Absolutely no guarantee that you will receive what described and the amount ordered. The website has a lot of funky features, trying to convince you that you are getting a bargain, good quality at a good price. Well, not the quality and not the quantity that you pay for. The only good thing about this site is that they refund fast, at least now. Not worthy my time.",1,06/06/2024
I recently bought several clothing items from Temu and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The website was easy to navigate and I found exactly what I was looking for. The clothes were high quality and looked just like the pictures on the website.,4,06/06/2024
"I bought something small on temu.com for $10. The next day, my bank freezes my card due to fraudulent activity of temu.com charging me $99 and some change. I research where and there was no order history except for my  $10 purchase. Temu.com tells me they can't help. The Temu company took my bank account information and expected I wouldn't notice an extra charge so close to my first transaction. Temu stole my bank information and tried to send themselves money. Shame because I love online shopping.",1,06/06/2024
I had very bad experience with my first order No one ever came to deliver package and said its wrong address where living for almost 8 years.When finally contacted temu and courier company and track package sent to ware house and picked up by myself. And some items arrive defective and never got any answer about return or refunds.And after that when I try to give other chance 2nd order keep declining my payment and asking for verifications and resulted in blocked from temu. Glad I found out these in one order. Beware or keep hassling for your packages. Temu Customer service is useless.,1,06/06/2024
"Website claims, ""free returns"" They do not have free returns.  Very very low quality products. Poor customer service",1,06/06/2024
"I. Love. Temu!! I have only had one issue with a late order but I received a $5 credit. Since October 2022, I've bought electronics, clothing, shoes, miscellaneous items and everything was great. I will continue shopping this app because the prices are incredible!",5,06/06/2024
Temu is a great company to deal with they honor their advertising commitments and the merchandise is as it looks on the website. You get more than what you paid for and if not happy refunds are quick. I will definitely use them in the future,5,06/06/2024
"Made a BIG MISTAKE do not order from this place. Placed my order 4/7/23 just arrived (4-17-23), moments ago. One pair of shoes to small other pair way to big.  Very Poor quality, connection seams can be seen and felt in shoes. I received updated about the shoe three times a day and text messages to purchase something else 3-4 times a day. Could have made me a shoe in all this time it took for the order to arrive.  Waste of time",1,06/06/2024
"I have been using TEMU only for a short time, but I really like what I have done so far.   I have had two refunds credited back to my credit card, no problem.   So far the products that I have received have met with my approval.  My only concern is that I want to make sure that any electronics that I purchase are CSA approved for use in Canada.",5,07/06/2024
WORST COMPANY EVER! ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! THEY DON'T CARE!!!!!,1,07/06/2024
No problems some things on Here are things Amazon has but lower pricing. I've purchased several items and had no issues. I love this site Received products in about 1 week. Depending on item in stock.,5,07/06/2024
"I love Temu, but you have to be a good shopper. Some of the stuff is identical to stuff on Amazon - if you go there, you can read reviews (Temu has some, but frequently items have no reviews). But be serious - you aren't going to get high-quality leather shoes for $12.99. This is cheaply-made mass produced stuff. If you buy clothes, pay attention to what the fabric is - most of the stuff is polyester junk, so I don't buy it. I'm picky about shoe quality, so I don't buy shoes. I wouldn't order makeup or perfume either because I like to be sure of ingredients. But I've ordered garden ornaments, wind chimes, bathtub hair catchers, dusters, magnets, bracelets and rings, canvas artwork, string lights, crystals, a little light that looks like a planet, and have been pleased with all of it. I've received all of my orders within 2 weeks of placing them. So I give 5 stars for my own experience. Overall, I look at Temu as somewhere to get some fun stuff for a good price. I won't be doing all my Christmas shopping there or anything, nor am I going to use them as my main source for things I really need immediately. If you use common sense, pay attention to what the product materials and measurements are, and understand that you might have an extra wait when you order from China, you can have an awesome time with the site and get really cute things at a great price. Plus, some of the stuff is literally the same thing sold on Amazon at half the cost.",5,07/06/2024
This site has great deals. If it's not what you want it  fit or cheap they take it back asap i gave received it in mail rather quick.,5,07/06/2024
The delivery time  is unacceptable.the emails are sickening. Lots of time items not available. Keep changing delivery times.  You offer a 5 dollar credit on late orders but Noone gets the credit . Unreliable company,1,07/06/2024
"Yeh, we get it.....the items are cheap and ""they"" may be spying on us -- what IS safe and who ISN'T spying on us? Our own government does the same crap and more! And yes, the products are of questionable quality sometimes and, no, I wouldn't buy a life preserver from them or a parachute (i.e., something my life depended on) but of the many things I've purchased on their website I've been very pleased overall. And in many cases the exact same items are on Amazon but for a fraction of the price with the only difference being shipping times of 2-3 weeks, and oh yeah, paying much less than Amazon's 2x-3x marked up prices.",4,07/06/2024
"I took steps to delete your website from my phone and you said it would take up to a week!  Not only that, your ads constantly show up on webpages I'm viewing non stop after I requested removal.I'm making a formal complaint to the FTC and I'm letting the world know to have nothing to do with your company as you practice deceptive advertising and are as far as I am concern, are in violations of FCC rules and should not be allowed to do business in the United States due do these illegitimate business practices, as far as I can see.",1,07/06/2024

"Received very shoddy merchandise and deleted the app after 1st order. Electronics broke, jewelry broke. Necklaces all too short, choker length. Everything smaller than it looked. Bought 2 items of makeup I'm afraid to use. Won't get fooled again.",1,07/06/2024
"I love Temu. Not sure what the big deal is with the person writing this article. If you aren't happy with something, you have 90 days to return it. So far, I'm okay with what I've gotten. Hit and miss on a few things. But, I'm sending back what I don't want. But, I'm not buying anything like wedding dresses. My purchases are a lot smaller than that. Good luck and happy shopping.",5,07/06/2024
Overall so far so good.  But I am curious/comcerned about sizing.  I see many 80% say true to size but many say to order two sizes larger than normal.  anyone have experience with this?  thanks!,3,07/06/2024
Stay away from TEMU. They are a Chinese company with locations in America selling Chinese cheap products. When I first started shopping there they were very good they sold me good items reasonable prices and packaged well with gift boxes. Now no gift boxes. Sellers lie about metal being stainless steel when it's only copper silver plated and will turn you green. I've been shopping there for about 6 months. If I buy a bit of items they jam them all in a bag and the delicate ones are damaged and ruined they want you to send them back for a refund taking my time and money. I suggest you stay away from TEMU. They have done me wrong many times. I have kept giving them a chance after chance. Their prices have doubled even though a lot are still reasonably priced the items are junk most of them anyway. They offer games and prizes for referrals I won three watches and a guitar I never got them I complained many times and then they tell me they can't find anything about this. Their games and referral program are a scam I believe don't refer anybody tell people to stay away. Stay far away.,1,07/06/2024
"This is a legit site. But do not waste your time doing their activities to get free stuffs or credits. They are only good on their first 2 months in Canada. Now the app glitches sometime that you won't be able to get what was promised. If you want something from the site, buy it. But of course do not expect for best quality.I emailed Rachel Zhang but no response until now.",1,07/06/2024
"I have been using Temu.com for a lot of online shopping since just before Christmas 2022. 16 orders to date--they usually arrive well within a 10 day period, but I think they've gotten more popular and we are now up to about 12/13 day arrivals. The prices are great, and the products are good quality. I've ordered a wide variety of items and only been disappointed in a few of them; not a problem though, because they are spot on with refunds/returns, and I have NOT been disappointed in their customer service! One thing I will NOT order is T-shirts in particular. I've ordered 3-5 of them. The graphics were either crooked or the shirts did not fit--ordered the same size and they were physically different sizes...both on the small side.As someone else mentioned in their review, you do need to be aware that if you order delicate items, the packaging is not padded. I've ordered a couple of metal signs and both of them were bent upon receipt. A couple of resin Xmas ornaments were broken, as well. Items come in a plastic bag and not much else; maybe a bit of bubble wrap. There are SO MANY items in their inventory, I know I haven't seen everything yet, but give me more time and I'm sure I will!",5,07/06/2024
"I love Temu. Yes, I'm a real person AND a very real happy customer.  I am addicted to shopping on this site. Of the hundreds of items I've bought, only one return. Piece of cake easy!I see the bad reviews saying the merchandise is cheaply made and I totally disagree. Critical of China made...if the USA did what this company does, that'd be awesome, but they can't. I don't like the bashing and scare tactics being used to sink this company.  Shameful.",5,07/06/2024
"Advertised Grand Opening Sale. Ordered $8.50 item..go to checkout, then they stated that the minimum order is $15.00..Just a scam..can't buy what you want have to buy extras you don't want or need.Give them a miss guysTheir reply was useless...Every other reputable site lets you order and pay for your selected product...What they are saying is buy extra products you don?€?t need to save the environment.What about when I throw them in the trash, because I didn?€?t need them in the first place...more landfill!!Try it on someone else...What a joke!",1,07/06/2024
"I was reluctant to order anything from TEMU until finally I looked on their site. I am totally happy with them. They have endless items to simplify your life. While shopping, I started copying the descriptions and looking on Amazon and Walmart to see if their prices actually were better. Oh, yeah. I found the very same Chinese made goods on there (as well as  Chinese goods in every other store I shop including grocery) , but Temu's prices are half as much and many times, even way more than that. I've gotten every order and it was late twice and I got a $5 credit both times. I'm in no hurry. It's not a big deal to wait awhile. If I need anything quickly? I'll buy it from one of the faster retailers. I love it. I buy all kinds of stuff that's cool and give it to family members. And I can afford to at their prices.",5,07/06/2024
I so enjoy Temu. Great prices and great Customer ServiceThey automatically credit your account if previous purchases   are cheaper or they let you know. Temu keeps you informed daily about your orders. I have nothing negative to say. Thanks Temu,5,07/06/2024
"I was referred to temu by a friend. I placed many orders so far and for the first 2 orders, half of my orders did not arrive. They gave me a credit, so fine, I was ok with it. Now 6 orders later, I never received my latest order ""delivered"" by speedx. I looked at the photo and noted that they delivered it to the wrong house. I screenshotted the wrong address that speedx delivered to and opened a ticket on temu. Temu closed this ticket as they ""confirmed it was delivered to the correct address"". How did they confirm? Did they even look at my photo with the wrong address? Been on hold with temu for 2 hours now and once I get this refund, I don't plan on ordering again.",1,08/06/2024

"I've ordered several times from Temu.  Nothing major, just a lot of cheaper things.  But I've been really happy every time.  My orders arrive relatively quickly and complete.  Packaging is very rudimentary so I'd be careful ordering delicate things.  I haven't had to return anything yet so I can speak to customer service.  I love buying the little gadgets but do have my eye on more expensive things so we will see.  But so far I am a happy repeat customer who us awaiting an order as we speak.",5,08/06/2024

"Update: April 22,2023I received my order and before the deadline as promised. I take off 1 star because I don?€?t like how I couldn?€?t contact Temu and 1 of my items has a bit of rust. Hopefully they pay attention before packaging if I purchase from them again.Previous review:I wish I can give zero stars. I received an email from temu saying my order is shipped, with a CP tracking number. I waited about 3 days to check the package tracking. The information said the seller has only submitted electronic information and they to inform me that I?€?ll receive updates. I attempted to contact temu using the same email that was used to send the shipping information. I received an email stating that my email cannot be delivered because the email does not match any record , so therefore it cannot be fun. My first and last purchase. I?€?ll be contacting my credit card company to dispute the charges. NEVER AGAIN.Update: Temu is responding for details? What I would like is for Temu to explain why their business email (the one they send my ?€?order shipped?€? information from) cannot be found when I send a request for details about my order.Response to Temu:The tracking information are not clear. My order ID is in my update, so I am assuming that you did not read my review since that you?€?re asking for it.",4,08/06/2024
Temu is not a legit business they do the bait and switch when ever possible for instance they advertise a 3d printer for 11.98 then the send just the filament this is one example be careful ordering from them but what can you expect from a Chinese company,1,08/06/2024
"I have shopped in temu 8 times ever since I have found out about it from my mom. My experience from temu has been good,I haven't had any issues when it comes to my orders & I have gotten my full refund when my packaged was lost. I always get what I've ordered, now on temu you sometimes get good things or sometimes get some cheapy crap that sucks. It could either way but they do have some things you would on Amazon or any other places for a much more affordable price. I have bought makeup, a perfume, bags, jewelry, pins, a pipe( yes I have gotten a pipe) keychains & many other things. Now I haven't bought clothes but my mom has for my siblings, for me for my birthday & for herself. The only thing that did suck was some overalls, some of their clothing can be very thin & cheap like wish or shein. All the stuff I've gotten was good material & still work for me till this day. The only down side of it is that it takes for ever to ship, somethings are out of stock by the time you wanna buy them & I feel that the coupons they have don't really work (at least for me they didn't). They tell you to spend a certain amount & the coupons don't work. It's definitely a bit better than wish in my opinion, I don't have to wait months for it to show up & everything gets packed in one bag which I like. You get what you pay for, you always have to read the reviews & look at the pictures of whatever item you wanna buy & don't always get your hopes up because in temu it could be good quality or bad quality. It's a good place to get cute accessories for your room or for your home & kitchen. Even some clothes & shoes which be careful with shoes. I wouldn't trust any intimate toys there, I haven't bought those because I'm not a cheapskate like that but idk if they work & they seem very untrusting so don't even bother unless you're a penny pincher & don't care.",4,08/06/2024
"I was skeptical because of other's complaints, but I placed a $50 order anyway. I received messages from Temu about my order arrival.

"Had 2 separate orders from TEMU, my first order arrived only less than a week to Melbourne Australia ???????? tracking delivery showed accurately, and my second order is on the way. Delivery was excellent by Australian Post, they're taking care of my parcel. So my impression of my first time order from TEMU is excellent the quality of the item is equal to the price and free delivery is a bonus. You cannot expect $100 quality with a $2 price. Overall GOOD JOB TEMU KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ????",4,09/06/2024
"Temu is legit! I have gotten a total of 18 free stuff and counting off Temu and they have been amazing. Some of the offers seemed like a scam at first, but if you learn to get used to them and find the easier campaigns, you would be able to get a lot. I probably got over $150 worth of free stuff over the last month and my experience with Temu has been great, and their customer service is extremely helpful, and they would give you $5 credit towards your own shopping if they can't solve your problem. This is one of the few companies/apps that actually stay true to what they do. Thank you Temu!",5,09/06/2024

"Temu is a dangerously addicting China made crap shopping app. 10 bucks here and there adds up. You could lose track of how many purchases you made and be shocked when you check your bank account. The app has access to everything on your phone. The games are rigged so you need to make a bunch of new user referrals and/or purchases but mainly new referrals. The deals are great, the shipping is too (temu alerts you every step of the way-temu notifications are nonstop) returns are simple, often you even get to keep the items, but the gra moissanites for example are fake complete with fake certificate, theres questionable stuff, a discount choking suction device, a metal chain necklace for infants, they could be strangled with (or put in their mouth once ripped off and choke on). A toy gun that looks like a real gun, etc alot of stuff thats not just offensive but could lead to death. Probably all sweatshop made, some things are decent but its alot like Amazon, not high quality materials. The thing is despite the security issues and the questionable items, the app, the sales, the spin the wheels ..its all so addicting that its quite disturbing. I decided not to make any more purchases and am deleting my account. Id advise everyone else with self control and self respect to do the same. Im sorry because right now Temu is being great with shipping and returns and prices are rock bottom but theres something off about a shopping app thats like a casino slot game. They really have gotten into a rewards center part of peoples brains (no surprise, China tracks every single thing on everyones phones they know how your brains operate).",3,09/06/2024
"I absolutely love shopping on Temu. The prices are awesome and you get FREE shipping!!! That's a win win in my book. I seen a couple reviews that were negative. I have had nothing I could complain about. Sure, shipping may take longer than Amazon, etc BUT it's FREE!!! ...and a huge plus is that they give you $5 for each day the shipping is delayed past the day it should arrive, I don't know any other site that does that. Also, I seen someone say the site is a scam and they don'tt actually give you the bonus cash if you spend a certain amount. That is NOT true. I always get the bonus cash they offer. I just received $20 today. Their items are almost always better than I expect and if there is a problem with the order, they are super helpful and always get the issue corrected. Awesome customer service!! I am SO happy I found Temu because I can buy all the clothes and things I want at huge discounts. I highly recommend Temu!!! I will keep ordering and racking up savings!",5,09/06/2024

My neighbor happened to see the package and saw it was for my apartment and brong it for me. One hour and a half later TEMU sent a message that my package had been delivered.

I love temu! I think I have placed around 20 orders. I did get five little dinosaur eggs that came broken but everything else has been great! However I pay for things and then I am told they are sold out - after I have been charged? I have yet to be refunded for the items? At first I thought it would just send to me when they came in but so far that had not happened? And I have a lot of things this has happened with? Do I need to have my lawyer look into where my money is? I don?€?t know how to vjnract Temu. However besides this I am obsessed with Temu snd have places 20 or close up 20 orders! I love this site but I just realized that I don?€?t think they refunded me. Others say they got a credit. I haven?€?t. So I sm frustrated about this,3,09/06/2024

"So, Temu has a Loooooong way to go before being compared to other on-line shopping! The quality of their products are your very basic ""made from China"" garbage. Their delivery takes over two weeks to a CA address. I used their $100 coupon and bought what I might otherwise purchase, from gifts for the littles and a shirt for me. I lost nothing for this test run. Oh, and their CONSTANT texts! OMG I'm so over them! Return shipping is non-existent. Won't use them again until they get their stuff together, and improve the quality of their items. I'm sticking to established businesses with something at least using / wearing.",2,09/06/2024
This app is a scam. They claim to give free gifts after you make a purchase and invite friends. You pick 3 gifts and uoy play a game in the app to get them. It stucks on the third gift to complete the draw game and it keeps saying that invite a friend to claim the third gift which never happens even if you invite friends. They are scamming people. I will never purchase from Temu again because they are scamming people.,1,09/06/2024

We need to get off the needle of cheap Chinese goods, I?€?m guilty , but I?€?m in rehab on junk from TEMU! And it is junk ! It?€?s now April 20th & I?€?ve had 4 20 minute calls with the very nice TEMU reps . Doing all they can , but the credit has yet to be issued .I have printed out the details of the refund issued Feb 24th at 12:40 am .I was promised urgent care , but all I have is 2 more calls . Nice ladies , doing best they can . I?€?m looking at their math & confirmation , but no execution to date .",1,09/06/2024
I got my stuff back nice and quick not a problem in shipping thank you temu!!,5,09/06/2024
"UPDATE: I have been contacted by the company and have been issued a full refund. When I finally spoke with Customer service was friendly and polite. No package received to date.I placed an order 2 weeks ago, and it was paid for right away, but nobody can give any information on the shipping  status. It says it has shipped but the tracking information that was given to me is invalid. Customer Service won't confirm or deny whether it has actually shipped or not. Once I requested either proof of shipping or to cancel the order, they said they'd have someone be in touch with me to help me out. So far, it's been 24 hrs without any communication.",3,09/06/2024
I had a problem with the way they did their coupons and I wrote a bad review and in the meantime customer service contacted me and attended to the problem rapidly and now I feel like a jerk and I should of given them time to respond to my message but I didn't and I'm sorry. This company is 5 star's all the way and in every way. I want to thank Beveral for going above and beyond to correct my problem.,5,09/06/2024
"Temu is awesome!  Do NOT believe all the bad reviews people are giving it here.  While all that glitters is not gold, not all bad reviews can be trusted either.  I have had 5 packages delivered so far of all different types of things and have loved it all.  They have beautiful jewelry, nice clothes, and lots of other great things at the most amazing prices.   Yes, they are in China.  No, they don?€?t hack into your personal information.   The worst thing that happens is that US customs opens every package and then tapes it up again like a 5 year old wrapping their first present and uses the whole roll of tape.  Be smart when buying from them!  Clothes run small so REALLY look at the size.  Don?€?t assume that a 16 is a US 16.  Look at the schematics and full description of everything.  I love that returns are super easy, as are price adjustments.  Yeah, they send a lot of messages.  Don?€?t allow notifications and it?€?s done.  Oh and the jewelry didn?€?t turn your skin green or anything.  Save some money and have fun!",5,09/06/2024
Everything has been going fine and then all of a sudden my account has a hold on it. Have reached out via chat and nothing. Have called 3 times sat on hold for over a hour each time to still not talk to someone to fix this hold issue.,2,10/06/2024
"I made a big purchase in Temu , my items were divided into two packages , in my first package came some makeup , and in the other package electronics , and since I did not get some makeup items in my first package , I thought I had it . lost, because in the app they specified that the makeup items would come separately, for that reason I had filed a claim, All my items arrived, they are very nice, they put them with the electronics, Thank you Temu, everything is very nice, and thanks to Trustpilot I was able to place my review and they attended to me immediately, Thank you",5,10/06/2024
Their products are Chinese garbageI bought a mouse trap and it broke two seconds after I got it,1,10/06/2024
Products are junk!  Either come damaged or are cheaply made.  They also send you like 10 notices a day.  You get one free return and that is it.  I have 20 products I want to return and shipping would cost me more than what the products are worth.,1,10/06/2024
"Ok at first I wasn't sure. But I decided that am willing to risk $50 and take a chance. Guess what???? To my surprise, my order was fulfilled completely.

They Carried on sending me updates that contained personal and financial details about their customers.They have contacted me, but despite a long explanation have not addressed the situation. They have sent me a virtual gift box,that contains free delivery on my next order. Update from Temu.""Thank you for helping us in investigating this issue. As we have resolved your issue, may I know if you could remove your 1 star review on Trustpilot.com? Thank you for your support and understanding.""Should I remove the review ?",1,10/06/2024

"Update4/15/23Temu has unfrozen my account and I am able to order again.  Thank you, Ms. Zhang.It took a while for the problem to be resolved. In my case, it took 3 days of patience.  I suspect that my message gets translated in Chinese and then the response gets translated back into English to me.In any event, I am in the process of sending in my 4th order so I am satisfied with the result.If I may give a tip to Temu, please work on improving your customer svc.  Other than that, your delivery service is excellent and you do keep your promise of crediting $5 if order is not received within the timeframe specifedThank you1st svc call hung up on me while I was trying to get the info he requested.2nd svc call answered my question but since I am not computer-savy taking a while to respond, she also hung up on me before I could tell her it was my mistake.  Then she put a hold on my account for ""customer behavior"" so I could not access my accountI had to find out about the ""hold"" with the 3rd svc call and he was fine and explained everything.  So now I have an account hold and cannot order anything.  This was my 3rd order with Temu. Is this how Temu treat their customer-paying accounts??????",4,10/06/2024
BEWARE! Absolute waist of time! Bad marketing (scam mini-games) false advertising...They try to make you believe that you can win $$$ or free items but it's ONLY SCAM MARKETING. Their games is all lies. Nobody that I know ever win a single thing. They steal all yours infos and friends contact and let you with NOTHING.,1,10/06/2024
"The prices are great and the products I've purchased so far have been perfect!

The beads, cords, charms and other accessories for jewelry are amazing!",5,10/06/2024
The free items are not given to you. They just keep asking for more invites . And when responding to a complaint they give the same answer that they will report it to the BBB. And block out there name in the response.,1,10/06/2024
"I have placed at least 8 orders from Temu and I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised at the whole experience. I see a lot of complaints about shipping times, do people not know it's not coming from Amazon? If you need something that quickly, get in your car and go to Target or Walmart, the longest I have ever waited for items is 14 days, but I plan ahead so shipping is not a deal breaker with me. I love their clothing it's very cute and well made, read the description of the items before you buy, I have yet to find a misleading product description, of the items I have purchased. Great Deals and free shipping, you can't find that very often. My orders contain at least 5-25 items per order, and I have, only once, received an incomplete shipment, which I let them know and they credited me immediately, great customer service! They have split my order into 2 packages, but that's fine. I Love this company and I hope they stay around for a long time. *Read the descriptions people and stop complaining for your own lack of shopping ability. I will continue to shop at Temu, if I don't get what I ordered or it's not the quality I expected for .71 cents ( insert sarcastic tone) I will either let them know or I will go on with my life... Download the App, you will get extra savings.",5,10/06/2024

"So people have always been sharing this website/app with me so they can get referrals to get bonuses. I finally joined and used some of my crypto to promote my link to get a few referees. But bare in mind people, ALL the bonuses require you to live in America. America is TEMU's favorite place, so if you don't live there, don't waste your time trying to refer people to get rewards because temu doesnt care about other countries enough to make there promotions available to everyone. Dont waste your time or money. They only care about Americans.",1,10/06/2024

The tracking shows delivered but I got home from work and didn?€?t see anything on my porch. I have since placed several other orders with Temu and would like a refund on this first order.Update: Got my refund! I was worried that I wouldn?€?t get it but customer service on chat was a breeze. I will recommend Temu to all my friends and family. Thanks ????,5,10/06/2024
"Nothing but Scammers, My order was Over $130 worth, and I never got it, they never answered me, and I been calling them and texting them, Stay away and save your money,No one answers my emails,They took my money and never received my order",1,11/06/2024
"I've received many of my orders in a timely fashion, considering most of them ship from China. Some others ship from the U.S. and arrived more quickly. If an order arrives later than when they say it should your account is immediately credited $5 which you can apply on your next order.That said the quality is sometimes what you'd expect for the price and the pictures can be deceiving. But if you pay close attention to details you shouldn't be too surprised. And I'v received quite a few items that exceeded my expectations given the low prices. And if an item does not live up to your expectations, in a lot of cases (smaller, lower priced items) it will be refunded to you and you don't even need to return them. They tell you to keep them, donate them, or throw them away. Customer service is exceptional and nearly immediate processing refunds and returns, at least on smaller items which is a huge part of what they offer. Honestly, I'm a TEMU junkie.",5,11/06/2024
"A lot of cheaply made items.  Many bait and switch items.  I ordered shirts for my wife that were advertised as cotton linen and they came as cheap polyester.  Shoes are often not the size advertised.  Some tools I ordered broke with first use or so cheaply made that they are a total waste of money.  All in all, think of TEMU as a online dollar store.  That is the quality of most of the items you get.",2,11/06/2024
"Scam.  You see something for sale and the picture and discription are correct, but when you have to select one of the options, the actual item is priced 4 times higher that what originally appeared.  Total BS.  First and last visit to this scammy site.",1,11/06/2024
"Alright, I'll explain in more detail. There are a lot of products to choose from, but you just need to make sure to check the reviews and stuff. The shipping is relatively fast and the packages always come intact. I love shopping on Temu since everything is cheap and there's free shipping. They also give out coupons quite often.",5,11/06/2024
"So far Temu has checked out  as a reliable and cheaper competitor than Ebay and Aliexpress (as well as Amazon for low-cost items).  Made some small purchases (like bike handle grips and seat covers) and rcvd. two $5 credits due to late arrivals (they came), but which shipping time was normal for such as Ebay. Free shipping as well. Thank God we can even get such.",5,11/06/2024
"I have placed at least 9 or 10 orders, and have received every item I ordered.   I was super impressed with the quality of the items.  Will definitely be ordering again and again.  Have already started Christmas shopping.  Love it..... Thank you for making this so fun.",5,11/06/2024
"All my orders have been on time, products have been great",5,11/06/2024
"The platform (app and desktop website) are built very nicely with very little bugs and hassle. Their delivery and late bonus credits are generous. Overall, yes I knew the products would be cheap. In fact, most of them are the same products on Amazon except lower prices here. I purchased 5 things and my expectations weren't high but wow, some of the items are severely cheap to the point they could potentially be dangerous. If you want to buy stuff, make sure you cross reference on Amazon to see what products are the same and then get them cheaper on Temu. The free gifts and promos often are confusing so I don't bother. I use this app for low priced goods because AliExpress disabled my account for no reason and their customer service is garbage.If you think this is a website where you could buy items at ""wholesale"" prices, you're not. Most of the stuff are worse than dollar store. The generic stuff on Amazon is a level higher than the stuff here so don't waste your time if you think the product will be comparable quality.Here's a short guide:1. Avoid buying clothes. A lot of bait and switch. Clothes are worse quality than SHEIN. There's likely some legitimate stuff but it's hard to tell.2. Avoid MOST electronics. They're not accurate and potentially dangerous.3. Most household items like organizers and baskets will be cheap plastic with sharp edges.4. Avoid cosmetics. Tempting to buy cheap makeup because you think real brands are marking up to rip you off, but take my word, those brands test their makeup and have to be transparent due to US laws. Stuff sold third-party on Temu can tell you anything and it doesn't have to be true.5. Lastly, lots and lots of bait and switch. Products with wrong dimensions, poorly edited images and overall misleading.",3,11/06/2024
"I?€?ve made several orders from Temu. Some came quickly, others I had to wait a bit. Almost everything was as good a quality as I would find on other higher priced websites. They?€?ve always been quick to give me a credit for delayed shipping too.",5,11/06/2024
"I placed an order for six different things and two weeks later it finally shows up, it was the wrong order, I chatted with support and they asked for pictures which I sent and they tell me It needs to be investigated by someone higher up, after a day someone finally emailed me just to tell me they were still investigating, then a day later they ask for more pictures?€? no other company has worse or slower customer service than this one, any other company would have had it fixed within the first chat session, I am still awaiting an email back so I will update this if anything changesUpdate: Temu finally contacted me confirming there was an error on their end and refunded the full purchase price + a 10$ credit so I will await my new order and update this when I receive it",3,11/06/2024
"I ordered from this company for the first time and they lied about my package being delivered. I never received it, and they won?€?t give me back my refund. I waited almost a month of sketchy updates online from them using TWO currier services, Lasership and OnTrak, and they both say two different things. I don?€?t understand why one says my stuff is delivered and one says that it still isn?€?t. I tried calling these people and got nothing but annoying prompts that did not lead to me talking to anyone about this issue. I am pissed that I likely just lost 40 bucks. ???? I will never order from these people again. ????",1,11/06/2024
"I actually don't have a problem with this company.I ordered summer clothes and shoes. They were all just fine. I even got complimented on my pretty red shoes.Everything was true to size,  Shoes fit better than a pair I just bought here.  Summer shirts came exactly as described and even had lining on the inside.  They gave me 5.00 twice for late shipments and I was able to spend that $10.00, on another item.  I ordered 4 times and am satisfied with everything I received. If we only had more variety and lower prices here, I would buy here.  I find what I want with this company.",4,11/06/2024
"Temu haa false advertising.  They advertise headphones for 3.16  so I clicked for that reason only and soon found out I  get them for half off at 28.00The ad I read said grand opening,  that's why I believed the very low price.Temu is click bate at it's  worst.",5,11/06/2024
My situation is a bit different.  I am homebound and never get out  unless someone takes me.  I found out about TEMU from my daughter in Kentucky.  She told me about your great prices and you were for real.  I am now a frequent customer.  When I need or want things I go to your site. Even if I just want to spend the time looking I go to TEMU and sometimes find things I didn't know I wanted. Thanks for the convenience. Martha WilsonnMartha Wilson.,5,11/06/2024
"Well, overall the site is basically a Chinese version of Amazon, minus the Amazon markup.So yes, it's appealing to purchase items at or around the same price Amazon gets a ton of their stuff.It's a crapshoot re quality.. you'll get some amazing products at unbelievable prices, then on other items you be like ""why didn't I check Amazon 1st""My suggestion is comparison shop between those two and maybe Ebay too. This way you'll be guaranteed to get the best pricing on all the crap you don't need.*Disclosure: I've spent maybe 4 or 500 bucks at Temu this year.**Caution: download their app at your risk. Prepare to be bombarded with constant ""notifications"" constantly on the crap you looked at but didn't buy & the crap you should buy to continue being a kool consumerist.",4,11/06/2024

Morning so I have purchased items and yet when I go back for updates it keeps telling me there is a delay so everytime I track my items it says delayed another 2 days can you please explain where these items are coming from is it China? Thanks for your quick response much appreciated I was only Wondering because I have been sent an email stating fully refunded and am not sure why this has happened due to I never asked for anything to be refunded is it possible for you to look into this please.Thanks,2,11/06/2024
I spent $129 and didn?€?t receive my package. I have been contacting temu for a week now and they?€?re telling me that they cant give me a refund!

"First order (21 items) received in 13 days, not bad since where it came from and having to clear customs.Second order (50 items) placed 3/14. Received 4 items the 28th. Banner at the top of my order page says, ""Your order will be split into 2 packages because of a/some sensitive item(s), such as liquids or electronics."" Doesn't make sense because there are no liquids ordered and each package has electronics??!!  And I don't see how anything else I ordered could be sensitive materials. But whatever. The problem is that the 2nd package has been sitting at ""Order is being packed"" since 3/25. And I can't get a straight answer from anyone. So disappointing. Was told they created a ticket and assigned a supervisor and the supervisor would get back to me as soon as possible. Haven't heard a word and still no change on my order status!!",1,12/06/2024
This company sells items depicting images of black face characters (in the 21st century )on I phone covers.  When I attempted to discuss the item that I sent them a picture of they were non responsive to the blatant racist and racial insensitivity of this item and did not agree to remove this item from their inventory. Do not buy from this company. I was requested to email Rachel.zhang at Temu to discuss my issue so I emailed her with an attachment I screenshot from their website of the black face ear buds case that the company describes as ?€?funny girl character?€?. By the way Funny girl character also comes as a cover for the iPhone too. No surprise when i checked my email the email that I sent to Rachel Zhang was rejected by the recipient. This was a ruse by Temu to get me to withdraw  my review which is very critical of their business practices. I repeat DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!,1,12/06/2024

Customer service sucks majorly and if you want a refund you better off doing a charge back with your bankEDIT- y?€?all automatically close tickets which makes no sense since that?€?s defeats the purpose of customer service?€??€? and it takes a day for y?€?all even respond back I?€?m still waiting for y?€?all to respond through email and it?€?s been days,1,12/06/2024

It?€?s odd that I?€?m spent a week dealing with another VERY LARGE COMPANY named for a S American river.  Every single thing that is brought up about TEMU would unequivocally apply to Bummerzon.  Stuff happens, don?€?t expect early delivery?€?.it might happen or maybe not.  You have a return policy that I have not yet had to use, but I wish that people would stop spewing crap without trying to find resolution.

"So I wanted to make this review because I wanted to truly tell people about my experience. I ordered my first package on March 16 I paid about $200 but then I got a 20% discount in price adjustment which brought it to $172 my package took 2 1/2 to 3 weeks to get to me. I was fully reimbursed because I had asked customer service to give me my money back because I just interested I would get my package and they did and they still also delivered my package. I wanted to let you guys know that because I know it is very frustrating waiting for the packages and waiting for a proper customer service response. However, they did go out their way to still try to get the package to me and I didn?€?t want to make a note of that. Some of the things that are happening with the package delay also is above Temu USPS has suspended their services in several states so that also is playing a big part until my packages are delayed so I definitely would suggest you take a look into that before ordering internationally or any states that may be a part of the suspension but all in all that is why they got a four out of five",4,12/06/2024
I've recently started shopping at TEMU. Products offered are endless and varied  items carefully and safely packaged with great response from customer service. I now order special one time items and reoccurring household products as well. Very happy with service and highly recommend.,5,12/06/2024
I have place several orders with Temu besides the long wait wait to receive my items overall pretty satisfied ! WHY DO YOU WAIT UNTIL AFTER A LARGE $70 plus order to offer a FREE GIFT? This has happened to me 3 different times ?€??€? Really MAKES ME NOT WANT TO ORDER ANYTHING ELSE FROM HERE ?€?.. FOR REAL!!!!!,4,12/06/2024
"I have placed orders with Temu. The products arrives all squished up.  There is no padding or bubble sheet to protect the items.  It looks like the items are just thrown into the bag and sealed tight with no care and no effort to ensure items are protected.  Meanwhile,  most of the delivery is handled by USPS, so the package is then squeezed into the mailbox.  While removing the package from the mailbox, the bag got ripped as it was obvious the large package was forcibly pushed into the mailbox.  Temu should consider using bubble sheet padded envelops or the heavy brown envelops Amazon uses.  These items are shipped direct from overseas, why won?€?t they take care with protecting the items?",3,12/06/2024
"Temu needs to deliver on time as advertised, not trick the buyer into buying inexpensive goods and knowing they won't ship on time and giving a $5 credit for $1 worth of crap. I will not buy from this company again. Very unhappy. This is the kind of company that gives businesses in China\Southeast a bad name.",1,12/06/2024

I received an email from Temu saying it was delivered but when I went to get it from my secure lobby, the package was not there. I contacted temu and after more than 24 hours they said it?€?s not their responsibility and they would not help. I am missing more than $300 worth of items. It?€?s their responsibility to deliver the goods safely. I need a refund or redelivery. I?€?m a loyal customer but this is unacceptable and i will be warning everyone not to purchase based on this. it?€?s ridiculous that I was watching for delivery and i still did not receive it. The problem is i paid for products I did not receive and that?€?s why I want a refund or replacement. Plus Temu is the ones that combined orders, so if temu delivered them when they were supposed to, I would not take a $300 hit",1,12/06/2024
Painfully slow shipping and poor customer service.,1,12/06/2024
That is a canned response.  It's what you get when you go on chat. It written by a robot.  How is that caring about customer service?Most of the items they have listed are not in stock. Slow shippingThey DO NOT care. DON'T SHOP with these people! TEMU is going downhil.  They are not shipping orders. I have had 5 orders pending since March 17. I've spent hours in chat and on the phone.  They don't care.  And aren't honest at all.  One person made a promise to me my orders would ship the next day. It didn't.  Now they don't promise a thing.Someone should have thought the SuperBowl ad thing through a bit more.  That's when they started going downhill and customer service totall sucks.  They are NOT shipping orders.  Save your money. No one really needs the junk and crap and stuff they sell.,1,12/06/2024

I got some wireless earbuds that lasted one week and broke, I even bought their expensive ones in hopes to get decent quality, when they did work sound quality was awful.

I finally got a second order that I placed and out of 5 items that I received, 3 were really nice. The bras were not padded and definitely not a medium size. The ?€?purse?€?

"I decided to use this site/give it a try. I ordered an iPad cover/keyboard and a stylus pen. Waiting two weeks for the delivery would've been okay if the product delivered was worth the wait. Something was really wrong with the product - it was flimsy, didn't fit right, just ugly. Not sure if they change the description because I purchased the specific stylus pen for my iPad and it was the wrong product. When I went back to read the description, the type was no longer listed. The good part is the refund/return process. I was able to process a return within 30 minutes of receiving the package. They didn't refund me completely for the pen and told me I didn't need to return it. I have to return the other product, which is another waste of my time. I probably won't be using this company for future purchases.",1,13/06/2024

"03/16/2023As in other reviews, the first 2 orders arrived very quickly, in about a week.I placed 4 more orders, the first of which was placed on the 9th of October, but still 10 days later the order has not been dispatched.Interestingly, the second and third orders were also placed on October 11th and 13th, but the orders are not being shipped.The reason is probably one of two things.Either the seller didn't timely update their inventory, or only offered fast order fulfillment to new members to keep them hooked.For the first problem, TEMU needs to tell the customer which product is delaying delivery.They should give their customers the choice of whether to issue a partial refund to expedite delivery.Waiting 10 days doesn't make sense. That's a processing level far behind Aliexpress.The problem is that all 3 orders are being delayed.I'm sure the last order, the 4th order, also be delayed.In that sense, I doubt that they provide fast shipping only to new customers.I will cancel all orders worth $250 if they are not shipped in 5 days(at the end of the estimated arrival date) because I have a trip planned in 2 weeks.Update 03/23/2023 : I received an update that it shipped exactly 2 weeks after I placed my first order, but until now, 48 hours later, the carrier has not received a package from Temu.Also, it seems that all the products ordered so far have been packaged and departed.They are toys that weigh at least 20 pounds, and wooden 3D models that require careful handling, so I'm quite worried about getting them without problems.I will update further when I receive the package.03/31/2023 UpdateA huge package arrived unexpectedly.The shipping company they provide, called lasership, is very slow to update.In fact, after receiving the package, it was marked as 'delivered' 5 hours later.There were so many items in the package because there were 4 orders in one box, and most of the items inside were fine because they were brick toys, but most of the item boxes were smashed.As a result, delivery took 22 days from the order, but orders after that were processed and shipped strangely quickly.They seem to be making an effort in their own way.I will revise the rating from 1 to 3 stars.",3,14/06/2024
Hi. Do you ship your items to Pakistan ! Because of your good prices you can get more customers from other part of the world. I can get tons of order from Pakistan if you guys can ship there. Let me know if you can do that. Thanks,3,14/06/2024

"I ordered 2 Large blouses from TEMU on 2/14/23 after seeing their ad on Facebook. I was charged twice for one order, finally got that straightened out and then the real ordeal began.When the blouses finally arrived after about a month, not only were they way too small (more like a Child?€?s Large), but the pictures in the ad showed the buttons going all the way down the blouses and said nothing about them just being decorative. In reality, that?€?s what they are-decorative-and they only go part-way down. In addition, the cats look as if they?€?re just iron-on, and I doubt that they would withstand machine washing.The TEMU website states: ?€?Free returns. The first return for every order is free! For additional returns from the same order, shipping and handling fees may apply {this was my first and last order and first return}. Any items in new and unused condition are eligible for a full refund within 90 days of purchase. ?€?Additionally, ?€?If you need to return your item (s), you will have the option to choose your return method. Select your return and refund methods. Then click ?€?Submit.?€? If applicable, print and tape your return label to the outside of your return package. The first return for each order is free.

Maybe I can use it to carry snacks and a drink when I run errands or something. The quality just isn't giving for what I wanted to use it for. Also, they had my package stuck at the post office when it should have come to my residence, which it eventually did, AFTER I contacted them and politely raised sand.I was going to order something as a Mother's Day gift from them...now I know not to.

Worst company ever you will get items months later they try to give u a 5.00 credit I don?€?t want tht where?€?s my items DO NOT ORDER!!,1,16/06/2024
"Two weeks ago I would have given TEMU 5 stars. But in the last two weeks all orders are not being filled. It is not the shipping company or the USPS that is slower. It is TEMU. They either don't have enough people to work to fill orders or they do not have the supplies listed. Some of the stuff I bought said ""pre-order"". They do not yet have that particular order in stock. So you may have to wait a month or more for your order. They have given me 3 $5 refunds to my Paypal account. And one order they are going to pay for completely if it does not arrive on Monday. That would be 14 days to wait for one order. At first I was just buying clothing. The clearance stuff went fast. Then they showed the new arrivals. But the new arrivals were the same as what they had before. I suspect they are having supply chain delays like everywhere else. I was counting on the good work ethic Chinese people have to do the best job possible. It is incredible that I have spent so much there but had I bought the same goods from Amazon or WalMart it would have cost me over $1000. At TEMU I spent $400 all together and I got a great many items that came in less than 8 days.",4,16/06/2024
"At first I thought it was a scam, but it?€?s not, all the sales and discounts and free stuff is legit! Cheap and not a very good quality but what do you expect. It?€?s like another wish?????????€???€???Shipping takes long as well. Not a bad website!",4,16/06/2024
"I was skeptical of buying from them at first worried it would be like others I have encountered online lately.  However I rolled the dice and decided to place an order for a unique item I wanted, so I bought and was very pleasantly surprised.  They were very good about providing me with confirmation of my order and very very good about shipping updates telling exactly when to expect my order.   What really surprised me was they said if my order was late they would be refunding me $5 on the shipping.  I have since ordered 3 times and every time my items have arrived as expected and on time.  I can easily recommend them.",5,16/06/2024
"Never had an issue,my orders are usually always delivered in a week to ten days! Love Temu!",5,16/06/2024
"Shipping was relatively fast, but shipping packaging was horrible.  All my items (a dozen or so) were tossed in a plastic pouch and mailed to me.  All of the cardboard packages inside were crushed.",3,16/06/2024
"I assumed Temu was basically a Wish copy: with a different storefront, and a long wait for the items to arrive. But my curiosity got the better of me and ordered some stuff anyway. Note that I live in Oregon. It took a while for the items to be shipped (waiting for a plane, just like Wish) then waiting for shipment from California (just like Wish). Now I find out the order is in Pennsylvania, awaiting shipment. Pennsylvania!!???€ This is fantastic! At this point, I don't even care if it doesn't show up. I'm having too much fun living vicariously through my globetrotting Temu order! Maybe it will go to Wales. I've always wanted to vist the home of my ancestors. ????????",2,16/06/2024
My Temu order including blade shoes arrived the first day they were due.I don?€?t know what the letters SMLIESML means. I am wearing the shoes for the first time and will require more time to know how good they are.There were no instructions for the headlamp. I am unclear as to how to turn it on.The remaining items on the order were satisfactory.,4,16/06/2024
So I recently found the site temu and placed several orders because their prices seemed great. Now I?€?m thinking what an utter waste of my time and energy. I have 8 orders with them placed on various dates most all awaiting packaging. Five of the orders were placed March 11 and 12th. It is now March 25th and nothing has been done. These have delivery dates that have almost expired ( as in the last expected date being past) one packages last allowed day is today another is tomorrow ect. By my understanding of consumer laws I should be given a new expected ship date but this has not been done by temu. It?€?s seems they are behaving with reckless regard to any consumer law or business etiquette. I think it?€?s time we hold them accountable.,1,16/06/2024
"I have made several purchases and have been satisfied with the majority of what I have received.  I do agree that the packaging and shipping could be improved. I have received a few items damaged,  so I mainly buy clothing now.",3,16/06/2024
I got charged 46.75$ in my credit card!! Card that it wasn?€?t registered on my Temu app I don?€?t know how they do it but I got scammed with that money!!! Be ware!!!,1,17/06/2024
"So far as pricing and product shipping,it has been great. I have not tried returning any item so return experience is unknow. Can they match Amazon's wonderful delivery and return policies, don't know yet but the price is definitely unbeatable. Kahn",4,17/06/2024
I placed two orders and was excited to find so many things for such a fantastic price. Well?€?.I have received several messages saying my orders were delayed. Several! I have been waiting way too long and have finally run out of patience. I just canceled both orders and requested a refund. Now we will see how long it takes to get my refund. I do not recommend this company to anyone. Buyer beware.,1,17/06/2024
Shipping is horrible and while waiting for items to be shipped items seem to run out stock.  I have been waiting for an order since 3/1/23 and it now 3/24/23.  Second order because I used credits and refunded money form the first order because of things being out of stock are not being shipped either.  I will not so business with Temu again.  SHEIN all the way.,1,17/06/2024
"I have ordered multiple times and never had any issues until after the superbowl commercial aired, lol, everyone must be shopping. Anyway, my ordered so far have been spot on, came in less than 10 days, but my last three orders took longer to ship, I received 20.00 in credit wich I used, my orders all have shipped, and I still shop the site, but waiting for my last three orders to arrive before purchasing! All in all, I love Temu.",5,17/06/2024
"Everything on the site and even the shipping is a joke. They sure take their sweet time shipping stuff. Even if you get a 5 dollar off coupon, you still have to buy 10 bucks worth of stuff. They win on the costs no matter what. Very clever. The ""games"" on the site are not winnable unless you know about100 people who will download the app. They tried to combine Shein and Aliexpress and they failed miserably. Those are legit sites and so are the games and point system. You don't have to refer a ton of people like you do on Temu. Hopefully the stuff I ordered is better than the site so far.",3,17/06/2024
"Actually, I love Temu! So much so, that I even joined their ambassador- like program! Below is the ad I made and shared on my Fb page and Fb Marketplace...'Have you ever tried Temu????? It's an app/site similiar to Wish, BUT, it's MUCH, MUCH BETTER????! First off, it doesn't take months ???? for your order to arrive ???? at your ???? door. You only have to wait a little over a week for your stuff to show up on your doorstep. The prices ???? are super low, but most items are made amazingly well. There is ALWAYS FREE SHIPPING ???? ! If you purchase an item for say $8.15, and the price gets reduced ???? to $8, if you contact them within a certain period of time ?????? , they will credit that .15 to your Temu account! I've purchased knives???? , rugs, jewelry ???? , glasses ???? , car accessories ???? , tools ???? , electronics ????, blankets, clothing ???????????? , pet accessories ???????????? , phone charging wires ???? , cooking utensils ???? , bathroom toiletries ???? , makeup ???? , sooooo much more. And out of all the stuff I've ordered over the past year, I was only disappointed ???? with 2 things. That's not too shabby for a Wish-On-Steroids site, imo ????!' Also, I wouldn't recommend this site if I thought that it was a scam or a waste of time &/or money. I know what it feels like to be taken advantage of! It stinks! Therefore, I don't do that to others :)I did have my personal selling link attached to this ad. But, I deleted it to post this here-I'm trying to leave a review, not make a sale ;) !",5,17/06/2024
Tried once again to order from this place but kept saying delayed shipping every time I tried to order so I cancelled several orders. I will never try to order again!,1,17/06/2024
"Such a fraudulent company, I've been trying to get a refund on orders that were damaged and had missing items for almost two months. They are refusing my refunds, and even threatening me. I've showed countless amounts of proof! I?€?ve called over 200 times, and I also have countless amounts of copied and pasted emails from representatives stating it ?€?left the warehouse in good condition?€? but that is a LIE! IT?€?S A LIE, cause if it did why did I receive it damaged and missing items? They are liars, and they do NOT take accountability for their actions! I?€?m owed a full refund for both my orders dated back to January! It?€?s March now almost April and I haven?€?t gotten anywhere! They have cheated me out of $416.69 in credits, threatened me, and even blocked my phone number! The customer service is TRASH, I?€?m going to report this to BBB if I do not get my full refund on the orders!!Update 03/26/2023: Still haven?€?t gotten any help, the Rachel lady that replied didn?€?t even help.. she says it to everyone.. I tried emailing her and she responded with bs. Tired of the constant runaround with the company. Still waiting for a full refund on the orders.",1,17/06/2024
It finally showed up very slow pretty good quality.,3,17/06/2024
"I have ordered from Temu 5 times. Each time the processing, packaging, and shipping times have become worse. My first order was packaged and shipped out within a day and I got it in 7 days. Now, my order isn't processed until day 5. It's packaged the next day, and shipping information isn't available for another 2 days. I understand shipping speeds are out of their hands, but the process before it ships has gotten much longer. They have great products at great prices, but I think they've gotten too big too fast and cannot keep up with the demand and getting their products out.",3,17/06/2024
"Place my first order and it arrived on time (the deadline was a Sunday) so the package was at my door early Monday morning, during the process 1 of the items was out-of-stock and I received a $5 credit and on Monday I received another $5 credit for being late, one of the items was not what I expected, so I contacted customer service on their web and the answer was immediately, send pictures of the measurements, I was given the option to return or get a refund, I chose the later and the refund was given while I texted with the customer service, so I will say, they have a fantastic CS, while other similar companies, never reply.  BTW my order included a beautiful yellow top made of cotton (it feels like Pima cotton) the design it's similar to Marimeko (Japanese design) I already placed my 2nd order.  I will recommend, if you are a patience person, if not drive to the store :)  Cheers!!",5,17/06/2024
"We have placed many orders with TEMU.Nice quality goods are received quickly, and at bargain prices!Shipments always arrive, and we have received  bonus credits which we have used for additional purchases.Very pleased with the huge variety of wonderful items available here.Will continue to be a daily customer!",5,17/06/2024
"They went from great prices and slow delivery, to slightly good prices and no delivery.CONFUSION: Have been waiting for deliveries for weeks.  Yes they give a $5 bonus if packages are very late, but who wants $5 when they need their items? Not me.And now some of the items also have been canceled.  The site used to give great tracking details, now you just get ""item shipped"" date but no updates on where the hell the items are.TERRIBLE. Temu went from a score of A- to now F-.Don't use them.",1,17/06/2024
"I gave a baby toy a good review b4 WITHOUT listening to the music! DO NOT BUY!! My daughter and her bf caught the awful, creepy words in the songs about cats eating chickens, dead deer, also saying ASSHO** and BIT** over and over?€?saying we are all going to pay and that we are the enemy???? All in a child?€?s voice! I don?€?t wanna order nothing from this site again! I spent so much money and referred so many people???? This is ridiculous and very concerning! For my granddaughter to hear this is very disturbing!",1,17/06/2024
I have placed 2 separate orders and have received nothing. All of my orders were for shoes. All I got were emails telling me you were out of stock and offering me a $5.00 credit. Your company feels like it is scamming people just to get their credit card information. I don?€?t want your $5.00 credits. I want the shoes I ordered or my money back. Then you will not hear from me again. However I do intend to report your practices to the Better Business Bureau.I wish that I would have read the reviews of others who have made purchases from this company. They have been subjected to the same horrible experiences that I have.,1,17/06/2024
I placed my first order and I had 14 items in in and it says it was delivered by a company called LSO never heard of them and it was delivered on my porch it says at 9:12am. I have a camera and nobody came and no package was delivered people were home at that time and now my package shows delivered and I can?€?t get I tried to get in touch with the delivery company but nothing. Never even heard of the delivery company before. Reviews for them say they are thieves so guessing my package was never delivered. I will never order from your sight again. Took two weeks just to get delivered and now nothing. Out 50 bucks and probably won?€?t see my refund is how it?€?s looking.,1,17/06/2024
"I?€?ve ordered two items on Temu in 8th March 2023 and delivery was scheduled between 13th March to 19th March. Today is 23rd March and I?€?m yet to receive my order. This is the first time I?€?ve ordered from this website and it will definitely be my last.I?€?ve contacted your shipper, Lasership, numerous times and got no response.",1,17/06/2024
"You know when something seems too good to be true or how many times we've been duped by items not matching the picture, well I got seriously scammed by Temu. I placed a relatively large order that was mistakenly duplicated by their company and charged a substantial amount for the duplicate order. Trying to return the order has been a nightmare. They sent a shipping label and told me to combine 2 large packages together in one very large box. I do this and then receive an email saying the label was only good for one pkg and I was responsible for paying and shipping the second package. Meanwhile, while dealing with them for hours via chat and email along with boxes and shipping, THIS WAS DUE TO THEM DUPLICATING THE ORDER. Still no resolution and no reimbursement. Please read this and don't follow in my lure of cheap products you can easily purchase at Dollar Tree. You don't want this headache dealing with these yahoos so please save your money and go elsewhere! THE CANNED RESPONSE INDICATES THEY DIDN'T READ MY REVIEW NOR DO THEY HAVE ANY INTENTION TO RESOLVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ETA:  It's currently 4/6 and the returned package shows it being received. I have the USPS tracking info indicating they received the package, but sent an email stating they're closing the case without a refund.  Save yourself the headache and shop at your local Dollar Tree.",1,17/06/2024
"I ordered 2 items and then 3 more the next day. About a week later I start getting these 5 dollar credits for my items: 1 being out of stock, the other for not arriving on time. I never even received the items before I cancelled. The company keeps giving you these credits so you will keep shopping. This is a scam. I am not deceived. I wanted my items and on time. Not credits. I have cancelled my items and deleted the app.",1,17/06/2024
"Terrible cheap junk from China. If you think you?€?re getting a bargain, think again. I have bought numerous items over the past several months and my review is that nothing is as it seems. Items are made with the thinnest, cheapest plastic and break immediately. Example, hair clips, brushes, hooks. The site takes pictures of their items blown up to look bigger than they are so don?€?t be deceived!The picture demonstrates ?€?strong?€? adhesive wall hooks, that not only fell off in an hour, but tore the wallboard off as well! Just one of the many experiences I?€?ve had.I ordered clothing, the sizing is way off and the fabrics cheap and scratchy. Even their sponges fall apart after a very few uses.If you want cheap stuff,go to the dollar store where you can at least examine the quality of products before you buy!",1,18/06/2024
"I'm particularly patient and I understand Temu, your demand is higher than your workforce. Clearly you under estimated how much inventory would be requested of you and meeting the demand is difficult. I'm trusting you, I will receive my 2nd and 3rd order, just as I received my first order. Things will get better, best wishes ????",4,18/06/2024
I love this app!! They?€?re something for everyone. Customer service is very good. Shipping time isn?€?t terrible and the quality of product exceeded my expectations. I check the temu app before I check Amazon now.,5,18/06/2024
"I received two orders with no problem. However, I have 3 they just won?€?t ship. At this point I would say don?€?t spend your own money with Temu. I doubt we will see it or the orders.",2,18/06/2024
"As others, first time 1 out of 65 items shipped the other 64 still waiting been thru one 5 buck and still waiting... Ty on response, will see if stuff comes in, already got the 5 bucks and still other 64 items in limbo, shows nothing in processing ect and no place to pick a refund for over 200 bucks of stuff. This was for my business but already missed one event window because of this.. Will update again by 30th but as others posted in last 3 weeks doubt this order will ever show up....",1,18/06/2024
Refused to deliver my order to my door...expected me to do a cab to airport and back to pick it up... dream on.,1,18/06/2024
"So far I?€?ve been getting a lot of fun stuff on Temu! I have gotten two orders and everything has been good so far. I mean the products are good. Can?€?t expect to pay for a Ford and then get a Porsche but still the products are overall decent, at least the ones I have received thus far. The only issue is that you have to be patient as it  take about two weeks or more to get your order. Otherwise that?€?s it. I?€?m getting decent quality products at a low cost. I?€?ve already ordered for Mother?€?s Day. If you need something right away this site is not for you but I am willing to wait as the prices are very good. One of my orders is running late and they issued $5 credit. That is fine with me and I consider that good customer service for the inconvenience. Again don?€?t expect to get your order so fast as you cannot beat these prices.",4,18/06/2024
"Have purchased several items & been happy with them. Then got the offer of a free gift in exchange for inviting friends. I never do this kind of stuff, but thought I'd give it a try.Invited friends who all said they accepted my invitation. Temu said they didn't, but ""don't worry, you can invite more friends"" & try again ????Must have just been a coincidence that the gift I wanted was marked ""in high demand"" and then ""sold out"" on their main page ????",1,18/06/2024
"I am completely happy with Temu. I have made several orders and received them all in a timely manner. Recently, I believe after Temu aired superbowl ads, they have been inundated with orders which has caused delayed shipping. However, unlike most mail order companies, they are on top of the problem. I have been contacted for each of the two orders I'm expecting and have received a 5.00 credit for each of the two orders, and an option to cancel the order entirely if I choose. The quality and usefulness of the items I have thus far received, as well as the exceptionally low price are enough for me to wait patiently for Temu to sort things out.",5,18/06/2024
"Sorry! Your package has not been shipped yet, because the dispatching of item(s) took longer than estimated. We are trying our best to hurry up. If your package has not been delivered by Mar 31, we will give you a $5 credit within 48h to show our gratitude for your understanding.I ordered this last week on the 17 and today is the 22 and it still says thatI have ordered so many times before that and the shipping came early than expected so I am happy with temu I will order from them again because the items were quality items and work perfectly fine.",4,18/06/2024
Temu is not shipping any order they just update you with usps label but would not ship anything. I did a big mistake ordering and trusting this company .,1,18/06/2024
More than half of 17 items are junk. Nothing at all like pictures and descriptions described. Like stainless steel you can tell if a few uses will rust. Then how pictures say size and I got miniature version. Now I?€?m looking how to return some things get refunded. I would also like an invoice of my items and prices. The price paid did not equal out correctly. Also no number to call for my complaints.FREE SHIPPING A JOKE,1,18/06/2024
"Luke Coment: Temu indicated my order was delivered...but I never received the order. After completing several steps online, Temu said I had to contact Customer Service. The only way I found to contact Temu Customer Service was to request a call back. Temu immediately calls you back...but then puts you on hold...I tried both yesterday and today and waited on hold for over an hour each time...then finally gave up. With such poor Customer Service I don""t plan to do any future business with Temu.Temu Reply: Hello Luke, thank you for your feedback and we are sorry that you are experiencing difficulties with your order.

"My first order took a week. Everything I ordered was there. Thank god. ???? Okay why not order 2nd time? I did and now taking a week to get it shipped out. Now, i'm finding out that shipping are delayed all due to an earthquake in China and surrounding areas. I hope everything gets squared away and shipped. I am looking frd to it.",5,18/06/2024
I have ordered with them before they was big ...you all gotta understand there was a earthquake over in those little places and it knocks shipping off ...but they have been good to me I got my stuff before Christmas they work hard ..but things like this happens they ship over water ..but they never been late before . however that earthquake was pretty bad one ...they order items from little places like that,5,18/06/2024
"I have 7 packages sitting idle for sometime now. 3 have been almost 4 weeks. I?€?m usually happy with TEMU but this time I?€?m getting nervous. I wish we could get some kind of idea of when you will be able to ship out. I did get credits, but what upsets me is many items I had already paid for were refunded because they said out of stock, well after I purchased them.",5,18/06/2024
"I've been using temu almost a year now. Everything we've gotten has been as described and lovely. And only one package so far has arrived late and acquired a credit. I have 4 currently that are taking longer due to high demand..and 3 that said that but shipped a day or two later and are set to come Wednesday. Everyone complaining about the recent shipping issues must not have shopped with temu long because this is not a normal occurrence in delay. I also have quite a few pre order items I'm sure are holding up the process a bit. Temu is not a scam, they don't take your money and not send what you ordered..or send random things instead of what you ordered. They are just getting bigger with bigger demand and trying to keep up. Have some patience. (This is why people gatekeep) Thank you temu for the great items and experiences. Thank you again for the compensation automatically given when things go wrong. I be fighting Amazon. ????",5,18/06/2024
"I am trying to give Temu the benefit of the doubt, but we will see. I made multiple orders and large orders at that, the first 2 came with NO problem but my 3rd was running late so they gave the $5.00 credit on Friday the 17th, by Saturday the 18th I was getting a partial refund, then today the 19th I received the rest of my order refund!?? Crazy. I mean I understand that there are issues that arise, but come on the stuff is coming from the manufacture or a subsidiary in China, so why is there an issue with supply and demand? I just placed another order to try and replace what they stated they did not have so we will see. Don't fail me TEMU....3/20/23I received a quick response to my review and I Thank You for that.

"Like others on here I am frustrated with the shipping. I have placed three orders in the past few weeks and nothing has shipped yet. I keep receiving notifications that things are taking longer than usual. I?€?m beginning to wonder if these items are ever going to ship. UPDATE: Not sure if it?€?s a coincidence or not, but I just received tracking information for all three of my orders. I am temporarily leaving my rating at a three becaue these items have not yet shipped, but at least a shipping label has been created. I will update my rating as needed based on whether the items are actually shipped and if they arrive.UPDATE #2: Changing my rating to a five star. The orders did come in late, but TEMU send $5 credits for each order. So... overall I would recommend them, but I would just plan on the items taking extra time to arrive.",5,18/06/2024
"I just received my first order and I am totally happy with everything I bought. There was no delay and I received everything I ordered.  I do scrapbooking and journaling and their items are great for the price! I ordered over 50 items for a total cost of $78. You can't beat that anywhere.  I ordered, paper packs, rubber stamps, die cuts, charms, stickers, etc. and I am happy with them all.  WARNING: You do have to pay careful attention to quantities and sizes (usually in mm or cm instead of inches) in the description as the pictures make the items appear larger than they actually are. Some papers are super thin, but I expected that because of the low cost. I had no issues with shipping or delivery, dates were exactly as stated when I purchased my items.  I definitely will be back to order more.  I do have two small criticisms: 1.) is shipping as it came in a very large bag vs. a box and it was pretty beat up and had lots of tape on it to keep it together; and 2.) too many ""advertising"" texts and emails after you order.",5,18/06/2024
"I have used temu for about a month now and a couple weeks ago when I would order my orders would ship and arrive in around 7-10 days. However recently, it has been taking way longer to ship (one of my packages hasn?€?t shipped and it has been 2 weeks). I have gotten compensated for numerous orders I?€?m waiting on still (still in the ?€?preparing to ship?€? phase) for 7 days or longer, however I feel like an order not being shipped in 2 weeks is absurd.",4,18/06/2024

I ordered a T-shirt and jewelry on March 4th and it was delivered on March 18th.The T-shirt is good quality and the jewelry is also.

Goods were better than expected.",3,19/06/2024
"Temu itself is great, the customer service I've experienced was great.  However, my items were shipped by a company called Speedx which is also the shipping company for Shein.  I had 3 orders in total with Temu.  1 order was split into two shipments on part being shipped by USPS and the other by Speedx all allegedly being delivered today and the other singular order to be delivered in a few days by Speedx.  The Speedx in the two part order said it was delivered and IT WAS NOT.  To add insult to injury the delivery person takes a pic of the outside of my UNSECURED building as so called proof of delivery with not even a package in sight and not even an attempt to bring the package to my apartment.  To add even more insult on top of that injury, remember the other package that had Speedx as the carrier and wasn't supposed to be delivered until a few days, well how is it even possible that 2hrs later it was marked delivered as well with the same time stamp and lame a$$ pic, when myself and the Temu rep saw the same info that it wasn't to be delivered until a few days.  BEWARE of that shady shipping company!  Their site is speedx.io with no further info except bs lying tracking and a number affiliated with Shein.  I am DISGUSTED! Temu had to end up refunding me $240.00.It's sad that I have to give them a low rating because of one of their carrier choices.  Although customer service was great, the fact that they told me basically that there is no guarantee that Speedx will not be selected again as a carrier is upsetting.  They need to ditch Speedx its horrible for their brand and to me it brought down my liveliness to ever shop there again.",3,19/06/2024
"Like other people I was hesitant to place an order.  I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. I have placed about 7 different orders and have received in a timely manner. The products I ordered were good quality items. I haven't been disappointed yet. I look at their website at least 4 times a week. Keep up the good work. ????",5,19/06/2024
"I came across Temu in Feb 2023 and was skeptical at first, however I did some research and placed an order and to my surprise my package arrived in the time frame they provided. I was able to track the shipping process, from purchase through processing shipping even that the package made it successfully through customs. I am happy with the quality of the products and also with Temu's customer service. I had a reusable coffee filter that was sent to me in the wrong size and no questions asked, Temu customer service refunded the item. I received my most recent order from Temu on 03.15.2023 and I am very happy with my purchase.",5,19/06/2024
"Buyer Beware !! First few orders went great , I started spending HUNDREDS of dollars and all of a sudden my orders stopped shipping out , i?€?ve been waiting SO LONG for my orders to be shipped , instead they keepcanceling my orders due to ?€?out of stock ?€? but when I click on the item it?€?s available for sale! So you have me wait weeks , cancel an item that?€?s still available?? Make it make sense !! They tried giving me a credit , but what?€?s the use of having credit when the items aren?€?t  being shipped ? How is a $5 credit going to satisfy my 423.00 order ( that?€?s just 1 order ) I have 18 different orders! I just wanted my orders shipped !  I?€?m so sick of trying to reach customer service with their generic prompts ! They have  caused me so much grief and aggravation at this point , i?€?m going to cancel my orders and cut ties ! Really unfortunate how much more successful this company could?€?ve been , but here we are ?€?..",1,19/06/2024
"So far I have placed 7 orders and only received 1.  My first order was placed on February 8th, 2023 and it still hasn?€?t shipped.  Weirdly my second order was the one that I received.I have to say that in the order that I did receive I had over 40 items and all but one were of good quality.  I was pleasantly surprised and that?€?s why I placed more orders.But now I am discouraged because the others ones aren?€?t shipping.I am in Canada and don?€?t know if it?€?s because they weren?€?t expecting so many orders and don?€?t have enough people to fulfill them but I hope that something will move soon.Edit: as of last night all my orders have now shipped and I was compensated for the long wait time.  Happy with the resolution.",4,19/06/2024
"I have been using TEMU for almost a year now and probably ordered close to 70 items in all. Not only have I been pleasantly surprised with the cost and quality of the items .. My expectations have been far exceeded !! Yes, a few items did not meet the mark .. but truly .. the mass majority of items have been better than I would have ever expected ! I am a very frugal shopper and definitely will not patronize a company that cheats the consumer .. so finding TEMU had been fantastic !! I?€?ve been able to buy gifts for ?€?random thinking of you?€? giving .. without ending up on a collections list. Everyone that has received a gift I have purchased from TEMU has been extremely pleased (including myself .. who I buy for the most TBH). As other reviewers have stated, it?€?s not the place to purchase items you need in a hurry, so don?€?t and you won?€?t be posting negative reviews about them. But if you like to shop ahead .. and don?€?t mind a 14 day (sometimes less), FREE shipping fee, delivery ?€?. You will not be sorry that you chose TEMU.",5,19/06/2024
"I placed a small order ($20 bucks) just to see the quality of the products etc.. But It's been sooo long since I ordered, I don't even remember what it was that I ordered. Still processing, delays delays. So sorry. If I ever get the items, which is doubtful - I will update my review.UPDATE. . TEMU  tried to HAVE this review flagged for removal. I had to prove that I actually ordered from them. It's now Mar 21 and I've yet to receive my items. I was sent an email claiming order had shipped, but usps tracking said that only a label had been made, however the order had not been received or shipped by usps yet.We all work hard for our money, we deserve better. I'm still going to review the stuff if I ever get it. By the way, those 5 dollar credits are a joke. Minimum order on Temu is 10 bucks now.",1,19/06/2024
I had put in for 2 - 3 orders all together just over $150..all together...what is trying is that it's been over about 10 days in which my orders are still being processed..and due to the timing even tho many items were available at the time of purchase all of a sudden they are out of stock and it them a week to tell me this... The $5 credit is appreciated but I would have rather had my order in it's entirety. If an item is out of stock just take it out of rotation instead of leaving it on the website.Thank you,2,19/06/2024
"I have placed my 1st order with Temu 2 1/2 weeks ago from today 3/17.  When placing my order I had 2 shirts in there for my husband that was ""pre-ordered"" which I was okay if they shipped late. Today I received a notification that they were sold out and that I could continue to wait and cause a further delay on the rest of my order to ship or I could cancel both the shirts and receive full credit back.  My issue is how does a pre order shirt that I had purchased sell out while i'm waiting for it to ship?  I agree with the other reviews.  Stick to Shein ya'all!!!!!!!  This website needs to get their stuff together!!  Way to long for shipping and they definitely should not be selling items if they do not have the inventory to ship them only to turn around to tell you that your pre order item is sold out after you had already paid for it.  And yet while I am here typing this email I just received another notification about yet another item in my order is sold out to. Just going to cancel my entire order!! Not worth the time ordering something if you unable to get what you ordered. Why waste the time looking on their site?",1,19/06/2024
I?€?ve been very pleased with how good TEMU products are. Simple items like 2 sided tape to more challenging electrical items. Darling clothes for babies and toddlers very well made. Facial items less expensive. Sadly I have one group of items I?€?ve not received. All I can recall in the order is Dog clippers as I was needing an extra pair. The order was paid for and made in Nov. I wrote company 3 times with no response. It even shows I?€?ve bought it once. Overall great experience and products:,5,19/06/2024
I returned a product in order #PO-211-12820117770870083 on Feb 6th and they claim that they are still awaiting item to to delivered at warehouse. The item was returned using the ups label provided and ups says the item is delivered. UPS tracking is 1Z4E2W099034492655And they are yet to refund 148USD.Disputed the charge with credit card company and was told that Temu did not receive my return. Have provided credit card company the UPS info and hopefully they will reverse the transaction.Sent message to Rachel and will update this review with the action taken by Temu.Action by Temu: wait for your credit card company to resolve your dispute.,1,19/06/2024
"I honestly feel like a lot of people are lying about their experiences with TEMU, because I?€?ve gotten a free air fryer and I received it, 9 free $50 gift cards, and car Iplay and alot of other free gifts just from referring people. I?€?ve also received many other orders and I have only put $3 into the app to cover some tax. If you want your stuff tomorrow don?€?t order from here but if you?€?re willing to wait for it I think it?€?s well worth it!",5,19/06/2024
"I made a small order of some cheap  items I use in the workshop. I just wanted to see the quality of the items, because I am used to paying 4 or 5 times as much on amazon or hardware stores (if you can even find these)  I was surprised at the quality of items I bought.I am making another order now.",5,19/06/2024

"WHY DIDN?€?T I LISTEN?? I have read temu revies where the person has been waiting on their items for 1-2 months! I didn?€?t want to believe it because my first 3 orders with temu went well. But I currently have 6 orders with temu that they have yet to ship to me. Some of the orders I have been waiting on for weeks and weeks ?€? and they HAVEN?€?T EVEN SHIPPED! Instead of shipping my orders, I get almost daily messages where they cancel multiple items from my orders saying that they are ?€?sold out?€?. But when I check, the items are not sold out, not even close ?€? they are still listed for sale! I BELIEVE THAT TEMU HAD NO INTENSIONS WHATSOEVER TO ACTUALLY SHIPS MY ITEMS, THEY JUST WANTED TO TAKE MY MONEY!",1,19/06/2024
"I received many gifts from a dear friend that were directly shipped from Temu. They all came in one package. All were jewelry items and in perfect condition. Yes they were shipped in a plastic bag but so are most. The package was trackable and arrived in a timely manner. I too, was skeptical & unsure about TEMU. After receiving my gifts, 7 pieces of jewelry, I feel confident about ordering from them. ???????????????????????",5,19/06/2024
TEMU IS A WASTE!!! CAN?€?T COMPARE TO AMAZON. Contacted customer service no help what's so ever. I ordered two items and only received 1 item in my package upon opening.  warehouse supposedly says they shipped out the second item so they can?€?t reship the item nor give me a refund. Such a frustrating company to deal with. Y?€?ALL DELETE THEIR APP!!! DON?€?T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,1,19/06/2024
"I purchased 5 ""XL"" bras from temu.com. But they sent me 5 ""L"" bras. I returned items. After they received the items, their website shows their warehouse did not approve the refund. I tried to contact their customer service via phone call, but no customer service representative answered the phone forever. Then I created a ticket on their website, temu sent me a very long reply, ask me to send the items back, then their warehouse will issue the refund. But I already sent the items back, they already received the items.  I believe no one from temu read my message, and tried to solve the issue. They sent same reply message to all customers with refund issue. I knew my friend received the same reply message. Temu does not provide any customer serivce, they do not care about customers at all.",1,19/06/2024
The first order I made on Temu I was happy and had a great deal on a quality pair of sneakers; my wife liked the sweater I got for her. It was shipped and delivered about a week.Since then Temu has been a disappointment. I ordered this neck pillow which was too soft and it took like 7-10 days after I shipped it  before the credit came on my account. I have recently made several more purchases and I don?€?t understand how a company can sell a product if they don?€?t have it in stock.  I ordered 4 products March 10 they have yet to ship and if they don?€?t arrive by March 29 they will issue a $5 credit.  If you do order anything from Temu don?€?t order it if you need it fast.,3,19/06/2024
"This is my first time ordering from Temu.  The shopping and order experiences were smooth.  They were very clear  & communicative about shipping, and it came on time.  The item didn't fit, and they refunded me promptly. This is especially important to me, as my size is somewhere between small and medium.I was initially hesitant about Temu, but everything. especially the refund process, was impressively well done.  I'll be shopping with them again",5,20/06/2024
"I have placed 4 orders on Temu. All arrived within the expected time frame. My last order was missing several items and had 2 broken items, however Temu customer service made it right. I've bought a lot of costume jewlery, some canvas prints and some kitchen items. I've avoided ordering any tech/electrical things because it just seems like common sense that they won't be the best quality. I'm aware that these items are made in China, they make no secret of that, so I'm not sure why so many are complaining about that. Yes, buying from China is not the most ethical practice, but if you don't want to, then don't, why complain about it? I don't have a lot of money right now and I'm really enjoying the things I've purchased. Wish they had better discounts for returning customers",4,20/06/2024
"At first I thought I been scammed by this app because i was shock of the surprisingly low prices then other retailers. ???? But I didn?€?t so my two big orders have been shipped after 10-15 days so I rate this 5 STARS ?????????????????????????????? This app is seriously LEGIT the only downside is you have to be very patient, processing is slow and shipping is sometimes delay due to high demand. ???? So always check your notifications and emails because they send me an email that my two order have been shipped wow so I change this review to negative to positive this app 10/10 so GIVE IT A TRY. ???? Every person should get their package between 1-3 weeks so it is fair. ???? But they are not done yet right now 50/100 I have two more order that need to be shipped one is small things the other is a little big but I am praying all of my packages will not get lost in transit and arrive safely. ???? Hopefully I get all the items that is from the image not something similar or different. ????",5,20/06/2024
Scam app!!!!!! I invited more than 7 people but the app wouldn't let me get more than 5 people to register as joined with my referral for the free gifts!!! One I hit 5 invites every time someone else tried joining with my invite codes they wouldn't count towards my 7 invites... I contacted support to see why it wasn't registering buy of course they were no help at all... Avoid this horrible shopping app.. go use AliExpress or ebay for Christ sake anything is better than scamu (Temu),1,20/06/2024
"Very poor Packaging orders came and cheap plastic bags bags with broken and items inside were damaged. Other than simple products a lot of the items were of poor quality for example leaky faucet fittings also they are very misleading by saying return shipments are free it's only free for the first order.

"I have placed two orders and not received a thing yet, worst part is no updates and the shipping window is like 20 days ? I think this site is not reliable and I wouldn?€?t order something I think I need soon as you may not see it for a very long time Will not use them again at all",1,20/06/2024

"It's extremely frustrating and disappointing to have wasted so much time and money on this terrible Chinese website. Not only did they delay my order for days, but they ended up canceling it and refunding me without any explanation. And when I asked them why, they refused to give me a straight answer. I strongly advise against wasting your precious time and hard-earned money on this worthless site.",1,20/06/2024
Terrible first impression. Temu offered as a first time buyer 2 free items which changed constantly. Glitch emptied my cart. No more offer. Terrible first impression. Subsequently purchased the cheap item for Mrs. at no discount.,1,20/06/2024
I love Temu. I just don't like waiting to get my package.  Seems like once it gets to ups  all hell breaks loose. I love Temu products.,5,20/06/2024
The app is depressing it keep saying I win free gift many times but ended up nothing because Temu always say invite people to get or earn your free gift but for a person like me I don't have friends no family to invite it makes me sad also I spend thousand in here for some very low quality products some can't even be use and ended up in my trash can.... though some of the products also like clothes that I get is nice,1,20/06/2024
"Temu sent my order thru USPS and the other half on SpeedX. I received the one from USPS but the one from SpeedX never arrived, SpeedX has no customer service and the Temu customer service was no help at all, I was not refunded for the missing package. Definitely will not recommend them to anyone. I?€?ll be sticking to Amazon !!!",1,20/06/2024
"Really tempting 'cos they have great prices on stuff I've not seen elsewhere. However, an order I placed on March 11 will not arrive till March 24, earliest. Too slow!Plus, all the spins and rewards and stuff - never saw it to use, and not sure I want to get excited about $ back for lateness or coupons or whatnot as I don't think I want to continue shopping there.",2,20/06/2024
"Seems like there is some trickery going on. Went to buy a drone that Temu had text a promo. The picture and description was a drone. But carefully observing, as I scrolled down it said 3 items. I clicked on it. It was a battery for a drone. The promo was for a drone. Not a drone battery. When I clicked on the other two options, which were drones, the price was way more than what the promo said. That is bad business. Im not sure if that?€?s something new they are doing because I just started. I have made one 20 dollar order to test. But there is obviously some purposely misleading trickery type stuff going on. Look at everything carefully and look to see below if there is more than one item. By default it was set on a drone battery. Pretty much a flat out lie in my opinion. 3 stars for now. They will learn eventually honesty wins. Trying to trick people will end them. They need to build trust if they want this to work. Otherwise people are not stupid, they will stop shopping. Get your descriptions right please. They are horrible. 3 stars pending. I believe in integrity. I will go out of my way to let all know if they are good or bad. I do reviews on every review feed I know. And there is word of mouth too.",3,20/06/2024

We ordered shirts and sweater(all in xl just in case,even that wasn't enough) turned out all clothes more or lesssomething between a M,maximum a L.so,useless.The small stuff we ordered(headphones,wristband etc.) are ok if you like stuff from the dollar store.End of the story: I deleted my account(it takes them up to 7 days,lol)",1,20/06/2024
Ok so I was skeptical at first but I ordered and was amazed how fast it came and my products were awesome the sweaters were very well made and super comfy the ear pads were wonderful I don't need my phone now it was Lenovo  only $13.00 Got fishing gear good stuff the only problem I had was with microscope and suit being too small but they refunded my money instantly I took a store credit as it is faster . And delivery for now is free . I'm a happy customer,5,20/06/2024
"They are alright. Ordered twice and had no problems with delivery. The quality is just like you'd expect with everything coming from China. That's why their products are so cheap. The things I got were small and cute and I knew they weren't going to be fancy anyway. As long as you don't spend too much money and don't plan on having to return anything, I'm sure your experience buying stuff from them will be fine.",4,20/06/2024

I have read a lot of reviews.   They seem to be very good or very bad.First of all.....you have to know how to shop online....and always use purchase safety like Paypal.I placed a trial order.  I always do wih new companies...never a large order the first time....and read all of th company policies and understand how the app works before ordering.Waiting for my first order.  Everything has gone fine so far.....I'm optimisicGreat prices........some interesting products,5,20/06/2024
"Everything I have purchased Has been great. And when it was the wrong size They refunded my money The same day or next. and told me to keep the item and give it to charity or who every could use it.

"Temu is great! I have ordered several times and the type of items I order mainly washi tape, stickers, microfiber cloths, cheap cats toys etc are wonderfully priced and way better quality than expected. I think buyers should have reasonable expectations when deciding which items to purchase. I did have a few items I was not thrilled with and did a quick easy return and was credited quickly. Delivery times are fine. Everything does come on a big plastic envelope that sometimes looks worse for the wear upon arrive but the contents have survived well. I also haven?€?t had any issue with free items and discounts. There is a clear countdown to indicate of you have met the requirements for promotions. Plus shipping is FREE that is why you can?€?t buy $5 worth of stuff. It is a business. Way better than Wish, Shein and other mega sites offering truly cheap stuff. After about five orders I am still a fan.",5,20/06/2024

I tried online with Name, Email, Phone but Rep could not find anything. I opted for Klarna 4 easy paymenst where the first payment was paid on 2/27. The Rep could not help so I called Klarna who said they received a bill of $101.00 on 2/27. I tried reaching Temu back since I found my Order PO# but could not get through. I really try to refrain from ordering online beacuse of the painful experinces I have had so here is yet another one! If you are ordering online, be prepared!

Missing out on years of sales and they are pissing off because they keep moving the carrot. Only thing that make sense is there building fast to sell them dump all the trash on the new owners.

"After several orders, I have had really good luck with this company. Items received are usually exactly as anticipated. Items damaged or missing have been refunded promptly. I'm very excited about being able to buy with Temu and hope to have a long and good relationship with them.  Note:  It may help that I always have them refund to my Temu  account and just purchase the same thing again or something else like it. Those refunds generally come in seconds. Also I always take photos of everything. For reviews or returns which is necessary for your return. I'm a believer in giving a good review when something comes good or noting the problems with something that comes wrong. Again so far this company has been terrific. No red flags here.",5,21/06/2024
"I received my first order from Temu. The order was easy to do and amazingly, the dates and times were so on point of occurrence. The products are excellent and true to the advertisements. The quality seems fine before use. After usage, I shall write another review.  I'll probably order again.Thank you.",5,21/06/2024
"Everytime I order from this place, some company called Holt Logistics starts charging my account with various charges. Never same amount. Last time it was 24.00. It appears we're being charged shipping twice.  I won't place another order with them because of this",2,21/06/2024
"I thought I had found a gold mine with this site and planned to spend money accordingly. And the quality of the items in the first order was good. But the wait time for orders is too long, and after waiting so long, the items I recently received don't match the description on the website.",1,21/06/2024
"I love the low prices and lightning deals and mostly quick shipping, however I am not happy that when I tried to place an order, usually it made me put at least $10 worth of items in my cart to checkout which I am fine with until it changed and now says I must add $20 worth of items to my cart to checkout and I am not happy with that because it means I have to pay more for things I might not want. I know this isn't about the environment or shipping costs. This is to get me to spend more money.*UPDATE* TEMU TRIED TO FLAG AND REMOVE MY REVIEW WHEN THEY KNOW IT'S TRUE. -1 star",2,21/06/2024
I have order at least 10 times from Temu and have yet to have an order that is wrong or messed up. I did have one order where I purchased a set and only one item came from the set and I was quickly reimbursed for it with in a minute or less plus they added extra money to the reimbursement. I am lucky so far that the items have held up accept for some one dollar rings. I didn?€?t expect them to last as long as they did without the finish wearing off. The only one that don?€?t do that are the stainless steel jewelry. The orders are shipped quickly and I have footed them all within 7 to 10 days. You can?€?t beat this company!!! Please don?€?t be an idiot and order stuff then complain about the quality when you get the item for 1/10th the price of an item that is more higher quality. I love these morons that do that. It shows how stupid they are. It?€?s like this?€?if you don?€?t mind wearing a bikini for one season then have it fall apart..then order from here. If you want one to last then order from a high end store. I?€?m happy with all of my orders so far. For the prices you can?€?t beat shopping here!,5,21/06/2024
"I received my order with 1 item missing and 1 that only had 30 pieces of the 46 pieces advertised. I wrote a detailed explanation to CS asking for a refund on both items. Jessica in CS wrote back to me telling me that unless I return the missing item, no refund will be given. O_o (not kidding), then she closed the ticket, so I had to do it all over again. How do I return an item THAT WAS MISSING from my order? She never addressed the item that only had part of what I paid for in it. Temu is doing this more and more.  ive bought several items (beads, stickers, etc.) that had a specific number of items that were to be included in the package and they shorted me. Clearly they don't think we'll count them. I do. If I get another email from a CS person who can't grasp that a customer cannot return what they never received, I will make a report on BBB and look into how to file with the correct government agencies on fraudulent sales practices.Update  3/10/23: Received yet ANOTHER letter from Jessica stating that I need to return the items I never received in order for Temu to grant me a refund. Time to file with the FTC.",1,21/06/2024
"I honestly just ordered something a day ago, when I went to order again it said 20 dollar order minimum, so I used a coupon and it still said order minimum. It?€?s honestly not about ?€?packing space?€? they just don?€?t want people to get cheap stuff anymore I was planning to order a couple things but with this order minimum thing I can?€?t get it below 20 even if I?€?m using a coupon make it make sense.",1,21/06/2024
I saw offer for pickup 4 free gifts when you signup for using temu app for first time.  I signed up put the 4 free items along with other items i wanted to buy and then when i go to checkout the free items just poofed and disappeared like magic.  I should?€?ve have known this app is too good to be true.   Good thing i didn't pay yet otherwise my money will go poof as well.,1,21/06/2024
"Just noticed my bank statement and there is a charge of $77,26 I have never bought anything from this place, can someone please from this company get in touch with me via e mail at  before I have criminal charges on this company.   Thank you?€?.this transaction took place today at 14:14",1,21/06/2024
I took a chance at this company but I was totally impressed! I got confirmation right away and they gave me a update every day as to where my package. I got my package in 10 days! And my wooden jigsaw puzzles were very nice. Good quality but small. But was perfect for me. I was happy with them!,5,21/06/2024
Good deals there is no doubt. But! Site navigation is a mess. Product information is below too much promotional material. App cannot accept pasted credit card information. When I went from the app to the web site to checkout it cost five dollars more because they red the promised coupon. Really cheap but don't expect the experience to be with annoyances and glitches.,4,22/06/2024
This company is a pain in the ass they have no unsubscribe on their emails which is against the law I can't get rid of them they inundate my Gmail account with bullsht that I never asked for I wouldn't shop there if it was the last place on Earth. This company is overbearing and I am in the process of filing a Federal Communications charge against them for harassment,1,22/06/2024
"This is my first time ordering from Temu.  I've seen people write that it is just like Wish.  At first I was hesitant to order but I put an order through.  I was actually surprised for the price/quality of the things I ordered.  I was happy with my order, that I just put in another one today.",5,22/06/2024
"I've just made my third order and am very pleased with both the speed and quality of the products. Tracking is first rate and you can follow along on every step.  The quality of electronic parts is outstanding. Only one product was kind of sub par - an ip camera that for 16 dollars is pretty slow and choppy compared to my others.    Negatives -   first off don't sign up for sms - between texts and emails it will annoy you. Far too many texts and offers.  I had to stop all these.Games / etc. The games and little time killers that promise free product are 95% a waste of your time. All in all (and I haven't had to contact support for anything)  I'd say it's very safe to test the waters and buy a few inexpensive items. Some products are of course too good to be true but not at the ""wish"" level of deception ... you know the 25 dollar 4k drone or the 40 dollar laptop.",4,22/06/2024
"oh my gosh, purchased on temu now what...all products like ....S... none of them working at all. NONE no wonder why so cheap and make by CHINAZ.PLEASE DON'T EVEN TRY. I rather than buy Amazon but not with TEMU. Beside all your information will be store in and landing every where in CHINA.",1,22/06/2024
"WOWWWW I'm so soooo glad I came here to read the comments first. I almost made a big purchase. I will definitely warn everyone about this ""another Chinese fraudulent junk store"" like someone stated on here"". Thank you everyone for sharing your experiences and for saving our pockets.",1,22/06/2024
"I am changing my review.  At first a little dissappointed, but they rectified the situation promptly.  Firstly, as a buyer on Temu, I am fully aware of what I am buying and paying for.  Remember, you get what you paid for.  If you expect high quality or the best of the best, then you are not too bright.  It's a novelty shop and they specialize in low cost items.  I went in thinking I was going to get garbage, only to find out that this is not true.  The items I received are not too bad at all. Great baseball cap, cool smart bulbs, and a nifty hair trimmer.  So far so good.  I know the items are cheap, and I accept the responsibility of that.  I have already received credits and refunds promptly and efficiently. The real only problem I have had with Temu is the deliver.  I have place three orders, the first one arrive promptly.  The other two not so much.  But I don't think its so much Temu, but their delivery provider.  They seem to package everything promptly, but delays happen once they are receive by the courier.  People, know what you are buying.  If you want Super Quality, then go elsewhere. This is not a replacement for amazon.  If you want to have some fun, and check things out, this is for you.  Don't spend too much money, (although everything is pretty cheap), and look up the interested items on other platforms.  It's up to you to make wise decisions and if you have issues, most likely it's on you.",4,22/06/2024
"I am so fed up with this company,placed a order Feb 6 and never received my order ,they said it was shipped to someone else and they will not refill the order, says logistics can?€?t at this time the courier is tired.So asked for my refund and they will only give me 30%, like wth hell I paid 80$ worth of items and they want to refund me with only 30%. Been arguing for 3 days now , believe this is a scam pretty sure I won?€?t receive my refund.review details not sure why but. I placed a order Temu says it would be delivered between Feb 8-12th,today is Mar 9 th, my order was shipped to someone else ,and I received a ring worth $2 that someone else ordered. Contacted Temu and they are saying they are sorry you can keep the ring but Will not receive my original order that I placed. Temu says they cannot offer to refill my order or give me 100% refund they offered me 30% refund, I said no then offered me 40%. I did not make the error yet they want to keep over have of my refund of what I purchased, this is totally wrong and poor business. I am waiting for either 100% refund or my original items I ordered.Company refuses to give full refund , for the mistake for sending my order to someone else, very pissed off at this so called company. Don?€?t ever order from them, believe they are scammers.",1,22/06/2024
"I am very disappointed with this company Temu.ca for their CHOICE of delivery service.  They use UniUni and these drivers will not deliver to apartment suites.  They just dump your package anywhere, such as, in the lobby, by the elevator or whichever is faster and/or easier. (Where they could be stolen or damaged.) Very poor business practice!  I have tried to reach out to both the delivery service (can't get through.  Big surprise! ????) and the company but can't get through there either.  Tried the support chat service.  No help. (Kept getting automated responses.) So now I'm going to delete my app & be done with them.  There inventory IS cheap but you get what you pay for, I guess.  So that's not my issue here.UPDATE:  I think I was a little harsh about TEMU.  It's actually a pretty good company to deal with, so far as their policy regarding their troubled items. An item I ordered didn't work & they instantly credited my account & told me to just keep the item!  Which I thought was reasonable. (I just trashed it as it was unusable )The delivery service Temu uses (UniUni) and I still think it reflects badly on their business as a whole!  I'll update if anything changes.REVIEW EXPLAINED BECAUSE OF OBJECTIONS FROM TEMU REGARDING THIS REVIEW, MAY 14/23: That said, I realize that complaining about UniUni's poor delivery technically may not SEEM to be Temu's review, BUT when Temu was made aware of the ineptitude of their delivery service ""of choice"" I was told they would ""make note"" of the complaint.  Therefore, I trusted that they would rectify the problem with the delivery service.  Then, the same thing happened again & then again! ???? I feel that the delivery service that a business uses is an extension of themselves (just as if there was a rude customer service rep or shoddy products).  It is THEIR responsibility to make sure their choice of delivery service is representing their business in an efficient & responsible manner, especially considering, they're in the business of delivering goods to customers.  So hence my review! I don't want to make an order, pay my money & never know if it will be received because of irresponsible delivery.  Also, I don't agree, as Temu does, that this review belongs in the UniUni's review catagory. Perhaps they should copy this review to their delivery service and take issue with them?",3,22/06/2024
"Are they for real? Sort-of. Kids clothes were OK, within general parameters of the pictures. A necklace was snapped in half (do I bother to return for $2? Nevermind, I figured) but two plush toys were perfect. Of three adult dresses, 2 were OK-- not great, OK-- and one was a cartoon level fail, massive overpriced for $10, and I actually felt embarrassed someone sent it. I deleted my account after two orders and probably will never try again, but it wasn't a total disaster.",2,22/06/2024
"I have ordered 6 times and have received the items. First package with free gift came quickly, other have come on the last date given. Which is fine, not sure why others have had so many issues but I have gotten everything. Some things are cheap material, but I mean what do I expect when I pay 98 cent to 1.48 for some stuff, you do get what you pay for. Now where I realized temu is good is they have products that Amazon sells for way cheaper. A backpack on Amazon was $69, I paid $18 in temu. This is my experience and happen to like the site, I know what to expect. I guess many think they should be receiving a premium item if they pay so little.",4,22/06/2024

"I started buying from Temu in January, and my experience with purchasing from TEMU is they deliver when they say, and so far, they have never missed a delivery date. I used to buy Amazon for all my online orders, but now I search Temu first. And second and most important, they have the best COST ever!!",5,22/06/2024
"I ordered 3 items from temu and they sent them after 3 weeks. 2 of the items were defective, missing parts. After chatting with them (as no way to talk to them), they said they cannot send the missing parts and to return the item. Now, only 1 item is allowed free returns, the other I have to pay for. What a SCAM from these guys. I would avoid these people at all costs. Typical Chinese site scamming people with cheap goods and return policies.Updates: The person who answered the review from TEMU, did not even spend time to read through the customer service notes. In one of the notes, the customer service said it would take months to get a replacement. Also, I had asked them if I get a refund and reorder this one item, would they give me free shipping as Temu has a minimum requirement for shipping. There was no response from Temu. This is why I will keep this same review. If there are 2 items which are defective, Temu only allows for 1 item with free shipping. This is not fair to the consumer.",1,22/06/2024

If you want to be harassed until you pay, with no guarantees that even paying will stop the endless notesfactions. Then the temu app is for you but not for me!!!!!  Update I am still be harassed by them but not as much as I was when I had the app installed also they come up with an offer for anything that I look at on the Internet especially if I look at it on Amazon but the low prices are gone they are now stocking me but the price is the same as I get quoted on the other sites.

I am not trying to discount others experiences or reviews, but my experience has been great and there was no chance I was going to get the deals I got at Temu anywhere else.",5,23/06/2024

I tried it and did not like it. Most items are not good in person. I paid $11.99 for a strand of fresh water pearls and they're tiny and low quality. It's a joke. I took a picture of it but looks like I can't attach it here. Most other items are just okay. Nothing great. Most are little in quantity. I will not buy from Temu again. Good thing I did not download the app. I just used the browser.,2,23/06/2024

Keep in mind that most of these things are made for low cost, so the product may not be a highest quality but if you compare to Amazon dropshippers selling the exact same product you'll find that temu beats the price by up to 50%. When I did have an issue with an item I was given a refund without having to provide a return. All in all it's a fun place to shop, you get what you pay for, and yes pay attention to the specs.

The next time I bought from them, they raised the forced amount to a minimum of $10 and tried to make me spend EVEN MORE money to ""save space."" These guys are money greedy and could care less about you only wanting to buy one or two items, especially if it doesn't reach their money expectations. They want everything shipped in bulks. :/ On top of that, this ""business"" flooded my email with their offers and other stuff on a daily basis. I am NEVER using their service again.

If youre outright lying or misleading me as to the quality of a known precious metal, at any price, then i just suspect the entire site...i also read the reply to this review...after all that's been said by Coco, of Temu, I still have yet to see or hear of any authentication of the true composition of the silver 1 oz bars they sell....just a string of reviews stating that the bars were just purchased, with no follow up review stating it they're genuine or not",5,24/06/2024
I amThinking to buy but don?€?t have credit card. Either I can pay by cash or debit card. Paying with cash is preferable. Let me know please,5,25/06/2024
"I placed a small order with Temu, which will be arriving today. Another review afterwards. But my main complaint is the ""games"". They are designed not to let you win. You get down to only needing 2 or 3 more cent to win a game, and a stipulation occurs. Down to your last fish and even after signing a new user...impossible to win. SO FAR, that's my complaint lol. Will review again after receiving my items.",2,25/06/2024
"Everything I have ordered has been exactly as I wanted. I had a missing item, they gave me store credit. When an order was delayed they gave me a 5.00 credit.The clothes are beautiful. The prices are spectacular!I have been shopping here now Since Sept of 2022 and I have no complaints!I love this place, and their prices!",5,25/06/2024
"Last year I ordered 4 outfits for my granddaughter out of the 4?€? 2 were ok the other two were horrible the material was very cheap.  Also I ordered a pair of sandals, the sandals were defective ( the strap between the toes was coming apart) I send them a message about it and they did refund me partial of the cost.  Also I ordered  some invisible stick on lift bras the glue is so strong that almost took my skin off it seems to me they use the same ripe of glue you get on the mouse catchers.   Very dangerous?€?",2,25/06/2024
Why did y'all change me and now my account is on hold Why do I need to verify ownershipAnd y'all already took my money for my order ?Explain how to fix this,1,25/06/2024
"They send me messages acting like they will resolve the problem,then ignore me. I am just asking for a credit on acct. Or a refund for what I paid for and never received.",1,25/06/2024
Was very satisfied with my purchase.  Shipped much faster than expected.   Very cute clothes especially for the price.,5,25/06/2024
Hi I purchased a lot of clothes and I have no problem with them the size was right and the delivery was on time love shopping with them,5,25/06/2024
"I first would like to say I was very impressed with how fast I received my order. Only took 8 days from placing the order to receiving the order. I ordered a bathing suit, summer dress, and shirt and everything fits!!!! The prices are awesome as well! Will be ordering again! It was nice to find a legit company for a change!",5,25/06/2024
"I just ordered a few items as I got promotional credit. Now I'm getting spammed with marketing texts, even if I reply with ""stop.""Annnnnnd they flagged my review because they thought it wasn't real...",3,25/06/2024
"I decided not to buy something. And every day, they send me about a dozen emails, and they refuse to stop. I may have to blacklist them, because my spam filter is not catching them.",1,25/06/2024
"I was very cautious purchasing from Temu. First of all the price of things was too low. I used a credit card that could easily be turned off if things went wrong. So far I have placed 2 orders and received them in about a weeks time. The quality of most of the items (wig, solar lights, sofa cover, usb lights, crystal charm and more) has been pretty good. I will continue to order cautiously but so far I have no complaint.",4,25/06/2024
"I love free shipping!! Sure; there's a $20 minimum purchase, and at least a 10 day wait; but to avoid my crappy city's traffic, Temu shopping is a great shopping hub.I see many critiques about the product quality. Frankly; most things sold are obviously cheaply made anymore.Temu can only sell what producers and retailers have to sell.I've never had any issue with Temu's customer service. NEVER.  Whenever I'd had an issue with a purchase; they immediately refunded and have never required me to return anything.  They've always been so nice, I concern that they could become abused; and be forced to adjust away from being so nice.There was even an incident while I was playing one of their games, where I was required to make some purchases to gain points; yet I realized I wouldn't be able to complete the game and became angry at them for feeling tricked. They offered me $10 consolation, and quickly returned my money even tho it was my misunderstanding. I see several recent reviews that counter my experiences.I don't know what to make of this...However, if I was a competitor that didn't offer free shipping; I would be frustrated by those that did.(Y'know;like Wish.com)Delivery has never exceeded the estimated times. However; I do expect the purchase currently in-route to me, will take an extra day or so. Weather does confound commerce... Yet, Temu sympathizes with the consumer and pays them for their patience. Anyway;The only thing about Temu that is funky for me are some of the customer review photo uploads. Not sure if it's a cultural issue or what; but(t) some customers like to upload their whole crack. Some cleavage photos are absolutely NOT about sharing the look of their purchase.""Free, amateur porn"" isn't ""free"". It's abusive.I am at odds with TEMU's games...The wording surrounding their ""give to get"" referral program leads one to think that a player can ""win"" a prize when THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THEY ARE ALL ""EARNED"" REWARD, NOT ""PRIZES"" OR ""GIFTS"".There are no ""instant prizes"" aside from credits in pennies and 10% discount offers after spending a designated sum.I understand the incentives are designed to make the consumer advertise and headhunt on TEMU's behalf. However, I don't like their wording in a few games. They're misleading.  ""Flip a card and win a prize"" is absolute horse-pucky.  (Shame-shame, TEMU... )  Their ""link for link"" campaign isn't fair either. Currently, the link trade only helps the one making a request, while the fummy helping gets NOTHING.I've helped many, and gotten nothing in return.  This leaves me with hard feelings about those members, TEMU and the b.s. games.The prices, delivery time and customer service is good enough to gain members without all the greasey worded incentive programs.",5,25/06/2024
"Very happy customer here, I ordered like 5 times already and everything that I got it was as good as I wanted. A Tip read the whole specifics on the product and decide if it is worthy for you to take a chance. Shipped very quick every time.",5,25/06/2024
"I made a large order of over $400 worth of clothing and shoes, which arrived within the next week.  I was pleased with the quality of every item, but some things, including the shoes, were either too small or didn't fit me correctly.  They were returned without incident and my money was refunded.  I will continue to order from this site.",5,25/06/2024
"Recently received my TEMU order. Some stuff was cheap quality but the cost was cheap too. Some stuff could have been cheaper with the quality it was. Overall i has a good experience with TEMU. I bought a hair straightening comb brush thing and it was cheap, but it works just as well as the expensive ones. I am very pleased with it. That was the best purchase. I purchased other random items that were too expensive on Amazon or not at the dollar store.  I would purchase from them again.",4,25/06/2024
I don't usually order from companies that I'm not familiar with but I thought I would take a chance after reading reviews and checking out their website. Their prices were unbelievable and I was also able to use a coupon for 50% off of my first purchase. I was very pleasantly surprised at the communication from this company. Immediately after my purchase I got a notification of regarding my purchase and continuous notifications regarding the process and when it was being shipped and tracking information. I have no complaints at all when I received my items which by the way I received on time as expected my items were all wonderful! I mostly bought scarves and hair accessories and was quite pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price I paid. I even washed the items to be sure they would hold up and had no problems. So overall I am a satisfied customer and have placed another order since then using another coupon that they offered!,5,25/06/2024
"Fast shipping.Great customer service.Buyer protection.Returns/refund e.z.Pay attention to product description and you can save $ with Temu.Between wife and I, probably 20 orders since November or so.New products all the time",5,25/06/2024

I have ordered 3 times recently and everything arrived quickly and what I expected.  You just have to read the descriptions on items to make sure you know what you?€?re ordering and be sure to convert cm to inches.  I am a happy customer.,5,26/06/2024
I have question can I use more than one Visa card a check out?,4,26/06/2024
I'm getting so many messages from people I don't know. Blowing my phone up from chat groups.,1,26/06/2024
"UPDATE: TEMU has reached out to me about the issue. Although my original question was unanswered, I understand they are taking steps to correct the issue.Placed an order on 2/21/2023. As of today, out of over a $100 order, only $2 of item has shipped, nothing else shipped and customer service has no answers as to why. I have been on hold with TEMU for over 20 minutes now. Still no answers. $5 credit means nothing if it takes 3-4 weeks for items to show up. I think they sell items they do not have in stock.",3,26/06/2024
"I bought on Temu BECAUSE they advertise that Canada Post does all their Canadian deliveries. But, NO! UniUni and DHL are also used. Bah. Bloody idjits. I won't get my orders with other delivery companies! That is SO bloody irritating. ????",1,26/06/2024
"Just a bunch of scammers; good for nothing customer service system! My wife and I have separate accounts. They have a huge problem in their payment portal system, and they do not want to fix the issue on purpose. After I changed my bank card and putting new info on their website, at checkout phase, an error message popped up. I contacted their so-called customer service. They instructed me to change my form of payment and I did! however, the issue still remained the same and multiple times I conveyed to them that I've tried different credit cards now and every time, the same error message shows up again. Ultimately I found out there is no way to persuade them that the issue comes from their end; So frustrating for a U.S based customer!!  Their customer service folks from top to bottom are not real; just a bunch of ROBOTS who have learned to create tickets over every single issue that the customers have and then they end up saying: We are sorry for the inconvenience and we cannot do anything about your issue !! What The Hell ...",1,26/06/2024
"Just like using wish! It sent notifications of tracking and delivery of all the products I bought to my messages on my phone. I found some great deals and great products, especially craft items that is used all the time and gone through fast at the daycare I own. Of course not everything is not made the best and probably isn?€?t good for long term use, but that?€?s all cheap products from any site?€?lol it is not a bad site to check out and I had no problems with payments or receiving the merchandise I ordered?€?.",5,26/06/2024
"This company should not be allowed to do business until they stop allowing counterfeits on the site. I reached out to them for an IP infringement about a jewelry maker on Etsy. They sent me a form letter with a bunch of hoops to jump through - and won't do anything about it.EVOKE Jewelry on TEMU's site has stolen tons of designs from small business artists on ETSY selling them at a fraction of the cost ($2 for a direct copy for of an item that costs $150 from the artist) and hurting their business. Their client, EVOKE Jewelry, even had the balls to steal the artist's PICTURES!  And Temu won't do anything about it. This is so wrong and I hope they go the way of Alibaba - you're getting a deal but if you're ordering jewelry and other types of artistic items - anything by EVOKE JEWELRY - you can bet the IP has been stolen and it's stealing from the people who designed and made it.- The response that was just posted by TEMU is ridiculous. I have already reached out twice and called I was sent form letters and they have not removed the items or showed any thoughts of doing so or even investigating.",1,26/06/2024
"great thing is price.....bad thing is customer service.also, be careful when they entice you to order more to get a money back",3,26/06/2024
2 weeks is kind of a long time for delivery in my op but they gives me a lot of things that makes up for it one way or another like the fact that the shippings free almost always and the many many many discounts that ambush me suddenly. Not the best but not the worse either,4,26/06/2024
"I love shopping like a Billionaire..this is the first time in my life that it happened ..and Temu brings lots of different products,  from around the globe, into our world , for little cash !!

Warning ?????? Temu is a scam. You may or may not receive the items you paid for. What you do receive will be defective or a miniature version of what you ordered.*Edit: after several hours of talking with multiple representatives at Temu I was eventually able to get a refund. It almost wasn't worth all the frustration dealing with all of the different customer service representatives. I had to communicate the issue with at least 6 or more representatives before getting the refund.,1,26/06/2024

They acknowledged receiving both returned items, however, was only refunded for one. Now I?€?m on hold for over 49 mins at  +1 (888) 495-8368 their customer service to dispute this. RIDICULOUS!!

Not too much $ wasted if poor quality.Unfortunately, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the item.I sew but cannot make these adorable clothes for the price I'm paying. I LOVE TEMU, have had one experience where I ordered a shirt for myself that was the wrong size. They told me to keep it, donate, whatever, I was refunded the next day or 2. I have ordered so many things for my granddaughter, all have been good quality for the price and very stylish.",5,26/06/2024

They have worst customer sevice. I received merchandise of poor quality with no directions on how to use in trying to return it they gave me a massive run around so I guess they plan on keeping my money while have items I cannot use. This am awful regarding their customer service. I will never another thing from them and plan on telling everyone I know better to spend a few dollars more and get some quality in what you buy and customer service.

"Didn't like getting bombarded with messages and  notifications -- it really turned me off to the app, so I deleted it and blocked it in my email.   The search engine is marginal, at best.  It retrieves lots of crap and only a few items that you're actually searching for.  Its can be nearly impossible to find something you've located the previous day.  It's hard to tell the quality of the items, but I'm guessing it's commensurate with the price you pay.  Not a fan.",2,29/06/2024

The quality of the items (jewelry, hair accessories, makeup, household cleaning items, socks, clothes, swim cap and goggle) have far exceeded my expectations for the low price. Quality is, in general, pretty good for the price. Rings, necklaces, hair accessories, and socks have been really great! The same swim goggle that I bought at a cheap big box store for $20, cost only $5 at TEMU. Clothing may be hit or miss, due to sizing and material, but quality is on par with price point. Overall, a great shopping experience at a much better price point than Amazon.",5,29/06/2024
Everything on there site can be found on AliExpress for so much less. They are basically taking AliExpress items and upping the price for low quality good from China and charging you 5 times the price. There is a reason the shoes on AliExpress are $3-$5 and it?€?s because they are of such low quality. So why would you buy them from there site and sale them for $29.99 on your site? Such a scam.  You?€?re drop shipping from AliExpress. Buyer beware your item will come from China and you could have paid pennys if you had just when to AliExpress and cut out the middle man.,1,29/06/2024

I absolutely love this site. Their baby girl clothes are adorable. I bought a bunch of clothes for me as well. I was shocked at how well they fit. I was shocked that they looked as good in person as they did on the site. I bought a ton of gifts for games for Christmas games and so much more. I?€?m definitely hooked.

Ordered a jacket from temu. I was a little concerned being the price was really good and I'd never shopped with them before. Since I was using PayPal I could always get my funds back if I had issues. Pleasantly I received my coat exactly as pictured and described and it didn't take that long to arrive. It was a very good transaction & worked out fine. I'd order from temu again for sure and you can trust that you'll get what you order.,5,29/06/2024

So as of right now I have been waiting for an order for over 10 days. It has been sitting in customs for the last five and all they keep telling me is it was shipped out when I contact USPS. They have still not even received the packages these packages were placed on January 30 and January 31 they gave me a five dollar credit. Oh thank you I spent $66 though got five other packages with no problem never again will I order,3,29/06/2024
I have ordered from here 3 times so far and have never had an issue. I have always received my items within the time frame provided. Thank you Temu!,5,29/06/2024
Temu works with multiple of logistics companies and I work for the USPS I got one of my orders through the post office but the major orders I ordered are from a different logistics company they shipped my package to the wrong apartment number and the person stole it I will be filling a law suit because I?€?m tired of emailing and calling with no help my lawyer will get involved because this is a federal crime and I refuse to spend money and not get my product my child is devastated because they didn?€?t get the items now I have to suffer as a parent something needs to be done about this issue asap or you guys will be going out of business just like wish did and I will make sure because this is bad experience for customers that?€?s spending money,1,29/06/2024
Order arrived in 5 days (to NY) which was 2 days faster than their predicted time. Package came with extra quantities (cleaning brush of 2 had a total of 5!) Quality of a few underwear were soft and great. A lot of their products are pretty cheap and likely sourced from Asia.,4,29/06/2024
"This was my first time ordering from this company and it will also be the last time I order from them. The little sweatshirt and pants were polyester, no cotton at all all and the crotch is almost down to the knees. The sizes are way off. Some too big, the others too small. One dress came with the lining sewn inside out. Very cheaply made, but I guess that is why the prices are cheap.  I don?€?t think the star rating they show on the products is an honest rating. Out of the seven items ordered, I only liked a little baseball cap, the rest will be given to Goodwill. Don?€?t buy from this company!",1,29/06/2024
"So I bought a list of items. Things that I could use, but I wanted to buy just 1 so I can see if the product is good or not. I was happy with some items and others were just plain garbage. So Temu sends an email for me to review each item. I did, 3 items received a 3 star or better but the rest (7) items received a 1 or 2 star. They sent an email back and said thanks for your reviews but we can only post 3 of them of course the 3 posted were the better score 3 star and higher. So due to there poor and dishonest way of posting reviews I responded to them saying I will no longer shop there. So all commercials you see shows your items coming in a nice sturdy box. That's false advertising, all the items came in an orange bag wrapped in tape. Items in the bag were crushed. Very poor shipping, BUT  they did slap a fragile sticker and a sticker for breakable items. My son ordered from temu for his mother for valentines day. He got her a watch that did not work. I went an bought a new battery for it thinking it was just a battery. It was not, it was just garbage. So do your homework,  think hard about what you buy, the item pictures do not reflect the actual item received.  I ordered dish cloths, a 10 pack. The picture shows real cloths folded nicely. I received 10 peices of fabric with a stitch sowed around it. If I were to try and fold it the way the picture is in the app it would be about 2 inches square.  Personally I will never buy here again. And the spam emails and texts are 100% annoying. Discounts for sharing there site with others but you can never achieve there tasks to get the discount.

"Up until a month ago, refunds and credits were straightforward. I loved Temu and told friends and neighbours about the app. Customer services were quickly and efficient. But no more. Since then, I?€?m waiting for days and days for simple refunds and missing items. The 1-888 phone number is legit, but the support staff on the line could not help because they had ?€?limited resources?€?. I spoke to a Laisha and a Gerald, both said they resolved my queries and took my contact details but I never received any resolutions.I?€?m still waiting for answers on my four open tickets.",1,30/06/2024
"The site is very obviously set up to suck up your time and keep you buying but the site seems perfectly legit.  As stated in the terms and conditions, if you do what they want you to do, you will get free items and while most items are made fairly cheap, they are still of high enough quality to work well.  My order and interaction with the free item deals went very well.  Very nice site for highly discounted merchandise",5,30/06/2024
"I have been going in circles with customer service regarding a simple matter. I invited a new user to join using my link, they accepted and verified their new account, but I never received the associated points. Yesterday I provided proof, as requested, and then the next day the ticket was just closed again with the same canned response that I had received the prior FOUR times. I have tried to call into customer service but end up on hold for 30+ minutes. The first time the call actually went through it was immediately disconnected as soon as the agent picked up. The second time it connected there was just silence. The third time I called it was again immediately disconnected (again, after 30+ minutes of waiting). So far, my experience with TEMU customer service has been very frustrating (and time consuming, to say the least). I have yet to speak with a live person. This is the polar opposite of my experience with Amazon customer service. I suspect TEMU will respond to this review with their usual canned response redirecting me back to customer service, who are inaccessible, so I challenge you now to PLEASE reach out to me directly so we can resolve the problem at hand. I will gladly update this review once that has happened. Thank you.UPDATE: One week ago as of this writing, I emailed the individual who commented on my review. To date I have had no response.",2,30/06/2024

"There was no order!  They charged me through PayPal 45.00.  I couldn't figure it out, I'd never even heard of them. This was on Feb 9. I started a ""ticket"" but of course nothing after that.  I later learned my roommate actually had made an order on the 10th, and her account was charged the same amount.  We share an address, but nothing else. She has no access to my computers or passwords, so she couldn't have done it. How does this happen?  I want answers.  You can't just charge 2 different people with the same address.  How did Temu access my PayPal?UPDATE:  After a couple of hours of taking to Temu's AI chat and a real person at PayPal, the amount they charged me was reversed (originally by PayPal, then by Temu).  Oddly, they also reversed my roommate's charge for a legitimate order she placed and paid for from a different account unrelated to my PayPal.  What Temu is saying is that she used my payment information to place the order, but how could that be if we were BOTH CHARGED THE SAME AMOUNT IN SEPARATE BANK ACCOUNTS????  Anyway, I'm done, neither of us will ever order from them again.",1,30/06/2024
"Just received my order in time for Valentine?€?s Day. I?€?m not pleased with my order. I am a new customer did not get any discounts on some items that I?€?ve purchased for Valentines. I did not receive the $20 off being a new customer. I was on the phone trying to go over my order. I was speaking with a very nice young lady by the name of Zharaya. I was telling her about me not receiving any discount and a few items I received were wrong. (There were no invoice in the bright Orange Temu Bag for me to check my items received/not received) She was delighted to help me and the phone call dropped. I couldn?€?t get through. Each time I called the SOS came on then the call failed. Anyhow; I tried searching for a valid phone number to reach your customer service department, the two phone numbers listed do not work it say call fail everytime I call those #s. Next, That wheel that?€?s on the app you must tap it before you can go any further. I tapped it. It landed on the $100 off on a bundle purchase and it will be added in my rewards?€?.not no such reward was added in my rewards or discounts/offer?€?s inboxes. The deception is real. So I couldn?€?t get anything accomplished with my order. I ordered two waist trainers one for my daughter and the other for myself. Listening to the description telling women to order a size up. I did. Now, I regret listening to that advertisement. I?€?m not so sure about my daughter but if I was swimming in the ocean; I would drown because my scuba gear is saggy. In other words, we are in a M and went a size up to a L it?€?s loose. I am also missing the other arm trimmer just the one was sent. I need two for both of my saggy bags.

The have false advertising.  I even showed them a screen shot showing what my total would be if I placed the order on the app.  so it was in black and white and all they said was as a curtesy I will give you a 20% off coupon to use in the next week  Which is nothing because you can find coupons for 30-40% off on line.,1,01/07/2024

"The customer service is HORRIBLE. I place a large order with them and when the package arrived, none of the items were from my order even when the label was correct. I had to call the customer service 5 times and repeatedly file complaints request to ship a replacement order. Finally the customer service responded and asked me to send pictures which I did promptly. After several weeks they claimed to have watched the shipping videos and practically refused to own the issue and resolve it. I provided evidence that I received wrong items but they just refuse to admit their mistake and resolve the issue. It has turned into a horrible experience . PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FRAUD COMPANY !EDIT after receiving the following feedback from Temu : It's frustrating to see this canned reply. As you can probably see , I have already mentioned that I have spent so much time with the customer service even before posting this review. All of my efforts have fallen on deaf ears. The website has NO option to ask for refund for the entire order anyways. Once again, bunch of liars. They really do not care about the customer experience as they claim. Save yourself folks.

"So I ordered some stuff from Temu on Jan 18th. It was shipped and was supposedly ""Out for delivery"" on Jan 28th. But looks like the USPS never delivered the package (lost possibly). The problem is that all of Temu's options are only after the package is delivered. So I am unable to get a refund. I finally claimed as ""missing items"" - that is the only reasonable option (there is no option for missing package) and their response was ""After verifying with our warehouse, we've confirmed that your items were indeed packaged and shipped to you. Your package was also shipped in good condition. Please reconfirm your package"". So if there were truly items missing, if they think they sent it, you are so out of luck. Useless company.Update: I had opened a ticket on their site on the 5th. After the reply from Coco on the 6th, I did send all details to them on the morning of the 6th.

The biggest thing I bought was a t-shirt and it was the right size and looked nice.

"There is alot wrong with this company. I would not order from them at all! I have ordered from them several times with same debit card that I even verified with them by sending picture of my debit card number and all the info. on card by holding card, taking picture as they requested. Some orders they will ship out while others they cancel order they say due to suspicious activity and I need to verify once again. They have no good reason whatsoever to suspect unusual activity and matter of fact they get paid by my bank every time I order as this is a debit card, not credit card. I have called complaining about this every time and get no results. They say they will correct the situation, but never do. I placed an order very recently and it showed preparing for shipment, all the while they got paid by my bank, cause it showed the charge in my checking acct., but then all of a sudden they say your order has been canceled due to unusual activity??? This was done to me by them again and again and again! There is something very suspicious about all this. What are they trying to pull? This company is a real nightmare, not worth shopping at. They have treated me very badly by my orders and I can't order from them anymore and I would highly recommend u don't either, cause they will become a nightmare to u over time just like me! I am going to give this company bad reviews all over the internet, better business bureau and everywhere else I can think of. They don't deserve to succeed as a company, cause of the way they treat their customers! I would stick with good companies like Amazon that are very good and treat customers very well! I have bought hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon and never had to go through this and never ever treated badly like this. Matter a fact I think there is something very corrupt about what temu is doing. Buyer beware! Don't support a company that horrible like this!

This new start-up has a humungus inventory of about everything you never knew you needed at prices so low as to be almost free.  From the start they are a million times better than decades-old AliExpress & almost on par w/Amazon (without the books) which I think is an amazing feat! They guarantee 11-day FREE SHIPPING w/$5 credit if not delivered in that time frame. They have easily accessed & overly fair CS &  email very thorough order confirmations & update notifications. I've made at least 7 large orders (none over $20) in the last 2 months which were accurately fulfilled. There were 2 delivery glitches caused by the substandard USPS service who couldn't find my house.,5,04/07/2024
Very high quality product with very cheap price. Definitely will come back again.,5,04/07/2024
I have ordered multiple times from this company and it does take a little while to receive your order. But I have been 100% happy with everything that I have purchased at a very great price. And I will be purchasing again as soon as I'm done writing this review.,5,04/07/2024
"I'm very surprised with Temu, having completed two successful orders so far - both arrived just as expected. Their product selection as well as prices and offers, are fantastic (no joke).",5,04/07/2024
"If you want your stuff in a hurry don?€?t count on it, been waiting two weeks and still a week out,",2,04/07/2024
"Ordered From November 2022 - Jan 2023 All orders arrived on time or day after expected. Being this is international. It was good.Products range from got what I paid for, to wow this is really nice.Temu does not make products. They sell them. The website is good. And why there are Minimums for offers. Its clear what you need to do.I will be honest I use Paypal not a CC as I do not trust using my CC overseas. Paypal is great about overseas if coming in no good. But so far no returns.The items arrive in bags. How they make it all that ways without damage? As basically these are none padded bags coming all the way from China to USA and then through US delivery and somehow are intact. I wont be buying big ticket stuff.But for crafts, and tools I think they are great.",5,04/07/2024
"I have bought several items over the past couple of months and am pleased with everything. I don?€?t see how they can sell at these low prices but I guess it?€?s the old supply and demand. Every item is wrapped or boxed separately. Really nice. All orders have been delivered within a 2 week period. That?€?s amazing. I?€?m sure there must be some items that may not be as nice as the many I have purchased. I recommend. Give it a chance. Hopefully as their business increases prices won?€?t. My purchases were from Dec. 01 thru January 25,2023.",5,04/07/2024

"The first time I ordered from them was a pair of shoes and slippers. So far they are good and both keep my feet warm. Ironically I got an email from another shoe company I order from and the same pair of shoes I bought with Temu were 10 times the price with the other company. I have two more orders pending, just small items, but i took advantage of their free shipping during this time. Order min was $10. I've seen the coupons, but you had to spend a certain amount. Any company does this, even major retailers. Didn't bother me I could use the coupon. So far I like them. I also order from Amazon and Ebay. Depends on Who has what I am looking for at the time.",4,04/07/2024

"I have never had any problems with this company.  I have ordered many times from them and have always been pleased and have told many people about them.  I have ordered tennis shoes, jewelry etc.  The quality of the items have been great.  I have had problems with my credit card but since I order on line alot I have had this in the past so I couldn't comfirm that it was Temu.  I have also had this with Amazon affiliates.",5,04/07/2024
I bought a soybean blender from Temu.  It completely stopped working after using it 3 times.  I called Temu customer service & I was told they don?€?t accept return or exchange once it has been used.  Terrible policy!,1,05/07/2024
"I like that Temu is reasonable and they have awesome products, however after buying so many times and receiving the $30 coupon there was no small print until it was time to checkout, then they stated I had to spend $20 to use it when I had already earned the $30 by overspending many times and they were like always out of what I desired and I had to use it in a few days and thankfully I happened to find that by accident. Lastly, I advise them to state this to people beforehand. Pdwhitley69",3,05/07/2024
"Ordered from this company twice last time was the final time as both time exactly 3 days later I get a charge on my card from another company I've never heard of, different card both times, both times reported as fraud and new card issued. First time maybe, but same thing happens twice thats a pattern I'd check your card statements people seems to me either 1 there's shady people working there or 2 its an overall shady company selling cc info to a 3rd party for profit this company need to be shut down!!!",1,05/07/2024

I was Skeptical. I read so many bad reviews. I ordered a 6 dollar pair of sneakers and a 25 coat. I figured if I lose 31its on me. Much to my total surprise the company was communicative and I received my order in 10 days. Even more surprising was the quality. 100% love them I placed another order today.,5,05/07/2024
"My orders were received in full.  Have had 2 large orders.  Granted, it wasn't received all at the same time, but 2 shipments isn't excessive for one order.   They aren't the only company to ever do this.   It was also received within 2 weeks.  99 % of the items were as good or better than expected for the price.  Sometimes a good deal is really a good deal.  Have to watch coupons because some are available to earn through sharing the website with others and aren't active until you do that.  Active coupons are viable on the ""you"" icon in the app.  Also will show points left to earn savings.",5,05/07/2024

"To contradict the ?€?lived experience?€? of another commenter is a terrible sin. To contradict the lived experience of an automated commenter-bot ?€? is this too a sin? What if the commenter-bot is set to ?€?Debbie-downer?€? mode? What if it follows up with its Debbie-downing with a pitch for a competing website?From Aristotle to David Brooks, the great Ethicists have considered just such questions, and yet these questions remain unresolved. Perhaps it is the questions themselves that are flawed. Perhaps you, I, we and all the rest of us might ask a slightly *different* question:?€?How can Temu be so dang cheap??€?, and its corrolary:?€?Is there a catch??€?I have read the complete synopses of Aristotle, Brooks and all the rest of them so that you don?€?t have to, and may instead get right down to shopping. Shopping on Temu, that is. What will happen if you do? I gave Temu a shopping-whirl and here is what happened to me:Seeing a nice-looking watch for $3.09, I clicked my order through even as I wondered how they could sell me a watch for less than the cost of mere postage. Next, I proceeded to buy another three-dollar watch, as well as a culinary windscreen and a picker-upper claw. Then, I settled in to watch my favorite TV shows. Two weeks later, I had barely finished binging the complete runs of ?€?The Ropers?€? and ?€?Grady?€? when there was a knock at my phone. ?€?Who could that be??€? I wondered, as I opened the phone to see a cheerful oriental fellow in a delivery-cap, holding out a package marked, ?€?Temu.?€?After thanking the man and giving him a shiny new quarter as a tip, I shut my phone and retired to the parlour to open my package. ?€?Will I be disappointed??€? I wondered, ?€??€?will I be pleased??€?  I made my way down the hallway toward the sitting-room. Upon arriving there and opening the package from Temu, here is what I found:1. The watch was beautiful! Its face was handsome, its hands delicate and graceful, and its band extra-thick with a pleasing weave. The band even had a leatherette patch sewn to reinforce its prong-holes. ?€?Wow!?€? I exclaimed, ?€?now I will have to run to the druggist?€?s to fetch a battery.?€? As if hearing my thoughts, the watch bade me to remove the plastic thingy on its knob, whereupon doing I was delighted to see its hands and date-wheel spring to life!2. I did the same with the other watch and was met with identical results. 3. The windscreen was exactly as Temu had described, and it came cleverly folded into a special drawstring carrying sack. ?€?I can use this sack to hold my grooming aids the next time I venture abroad!?€? I remarked with satisfaction. 4. The picker-upper claw was folded into a compact shape and held thus by an ingenious little clasp. Unfolding the claw to test it out on a few household items the cat had strewn on the parlour floor, I was pleased to find that it gripped and picked up each item with all-but effortless dexterity. I was even able to make delicate adjustments to several of the curios I show off in a display cabinet, curios that had earlier stymied my clumsy hands. What the claw had, that my hands lack, were two soft latex pads on its grasping surface, pads that gave a grip far more sure than the fingerprints I was born with. The price of all this retail satisfaction? $20.00, including tax and shipping. I am no April guinea-fowl. I have traveled this county and shopped its WalMarts, its Targets, and its Nordstrom Racks. There I have spent as much as $18.00 on a watch, only to wind up?????? with some wretched and unfashionable gizmo that fails after a week or two. I have searched in vain for the picker-upper claws and culinary windscreens those stores do not carry. Believe me when I tell you, Temu is where it is at. When that day arrives when I must leave my large house with its comfortable parlour, and must enter the dormitory-pod in a 10,000-unit podplex identical to the podplex that houses the workers who, far off in the orient, assembled my Temu merchandise, I will not even feel resentful. No, I will simply listen to the pleasing ticktock of my Temu watches as I twiddle the scrollwheel of my pod?€?s entertainment controlpad and settle in to binge the complete run of ?€?Enos.?€? Come in, Houston! We have a bright new future.",5,05/07/2024

It has been a nightmare with this company. But let me start with this last situation Friday. They sent me shoes with no soles. Scuffs and scratches and dirty.their literally trash. I?€?ve been trying to get this company to help me bye credit my balance back on my account for 2 days. They want you to sit on your phone 4 to 5 hours literally and every 4 mins click on I?€?ll wait when it pops up. If you don?€?t it will throw you out of Q. Oh but here the big one when you get to 11 in Q you stay their for about 3 hours and then out of no where it will say haven?€?t heard from you in a while and it will kick you out of Q. For 2 days I?€?ve sat in Q 5 hours each day to get no help. They keep sending me some message that their warehouse said they were in fair condition. I sent them video?€?s & pictures of the shoes the day they arrived. They always send broke items and missing items. The reason a lot of this stuff is broken it?€?s because they ship in bags which hello that?€?s not to smart. All I want is my credit balance refunded and for them to take responsibility because this is nasty to send someone used shoes,1,05/07/2024
"I've had two orders from them, which I did receive. Delivery was fairly slow, but they provide decent tracking information. Quality of the items received was OK, on the cheap side. If you are concerned about them sharing/selling your information get an extra free email account from some site like proton mail.",3,05/07/2024
"I got my product as promised.  However, about a week after it was delivered, my credit card was used multiple times for $1 purchases on Microsoft.  I only used my card a few places and the fact that the purchases were so small points to someone doing this on a large scale to be profitable.  I can't prove Temu sold my card #, but the timing certainly suggests such.  I have a new card on the way and no desire to risk my financial info with a Chinese business again.",1,05/07/2024
"Was hesitant to order, but could not be happier!  I have now ordered 8 times with NO problems. Low prices, good quality. If it doesn't arrive by specified date you get a $5 credit.

Seem to be a China based company but items ship from the USA",5,05/07/2024
I placed my order a month ago and I have not received notice that it has shipped.,2,05/07/2024
"Stay away from this company.  I placed 2 separate orders. Had to return both because they didn't fit. Both orders came in the same package.  They gave me one UPS label for both orders. Only credited one order. When I called about the refund on my second order they claim it didn't exist.  Of course it was the more expensive order of the two. Spent 1 hour on the phone with my credit card company to file a complaint.  Temu is a bunch of scammers. UPDATE, I did get a message from Temu. They seem to think there is another return coming.  They had me place both orders in the same bag under one UPS label.  I will let my card company deal with them.  They obviously don't understand.  Until this situation is resolved I stand by my original statement.",1,05/07/2024
"Because we like the merchandise that we order, but the biggest surprice was that we was expecting the delivery by January 22nd and we received today January 19th at 12:32 PM. by choosing UPS for the delivery make it greater. THANK YOU A LOT!",4,06/07/2024
"The customer service from Temu is deplorable. I have made one order from Temu which has not yet arrived. However upon making a second purchase, my order was canceled by Temu and my account placed on high fraud risk in their system. No one seem to be able to tell my why it happened and no one can give me any guidance on how to move forward. They've asked for proof of ownership which I have done and yet still I can't make any payments. I am however being bombarded with advertising emails and not one email about my problem. They close support tickets without responding to your query. It's just a customer service nightmare.",1,06/07/2024
"I?€?ve ordered atleast 5 times now and so far not too bad. Since I don?€?t really have the extra fund I?€?ve usually only been getting stuff like jewelry and what not that?€?s under $1. Most items are what the description says. A few weren?€?t as great but I was quickly able to get a refund. Shipping is okay, could be better but on the plus side we get free credits for late items which is nice. But I?€?m not too fond of customer service. While part of the time they?€?ve been helpfully. There?€?s still a good chunk where I just got the run around and felt like I was talk to a robot that didn?€?t understand. I also have mix feelings relating the ?€?games?€? in the app. While I find it awesome we can win free items or get credits and so on. I?€?m not too fond with how fast things have changed nor how hard the games became to even win anymore.",4,06/07/2024
I received exactly what I ordered and everything was great.  This has been my first order with Temu.  My order came right on time and the merchandise will exactly what I ordered and I am thinking of using them again.  But the reviews of this company are brutal so I'm having second thoughts about it now.  I like the stuff that they had but maybe I will wait and investigate and rea more reviews. I just will wait a while. This first order was spot on. I'm very happy with Temu. But I received some cards but don't know or understand how to use them.  Can anyone let me know?,5,06/07/2024
"i ordered 12 items 6 of them were lego style building sets and 2 packs of military vehicles toys, they came damaged and crush because they shipped it in a plastic bag with no bubble wrap, why wasn't this shipped in a box, had to file for a refund and send damaged items back, what a waste, makes no sense to ship in a plastic bag",1,06/07/2024
Worst ever customer service experience. My order number PO-211-11755278008950924 dint got delivered and I reached out to their poor customer support 10+ times via phone/chat and those arrogant executives are telling me do whatever you want you?€?ll not be getting a refund or a reshipment of the order. First they don?€?t deliver your order and then when you reach out to them to seek a resolution even after 10+ times you face such foolish frustrating people all the time. So any one who?€?s reading this review simply never think of buying anything from these literally scamming company who?€?ll never deliver things and then to make things worse will have to go through their ever irating customer care folks who literally needs to be slapped hard as ever because of their way of addressing the customer?€?s issue. Just don?€?t ever think of buying anything from this scamming company.,1,06/07/2024
"I heard about Temu from my friend during their free item promotion in September, so I gave it a try and they delivered even with no minimum order. The free rug I received is surprisingly well made and has been holding up good as new for months. I was a little skeptical at first, but after placing an order following that, I became more trustworthy of Temu.I'm consistently surprised by the quality of items I receive from Temu for jaw droppingly low prices. Many of these are the same products you see on Amazon or even in stores like Target and Walmart, just under alternate brand names at times. Expect the same quality you would find at those retailers under most circumstances. I've had good luck buying jewelry there so long as I check that it's stainless steel or titanium, and my skin hasn't turned green at all. Even bags and backpacks I've ordered are better quality than some name brand products. If you want to shop at Temu, I recommend it, but only if you're accustomed to shopping at online marketplaces. Be an informed customer, never expect an affordable item to be like an expensive one. When I offered a coupon to my mom, she turned her nose up at it. If you're anything like her in that you just prefer name brand products and a long history of rapport with any company, I don't know if I recommend Temu. Just like with Amazon and Wish, there is range of quality on Temu and you have to know how to spot whether an item is going to be cheap and flimsy or not. You also have to accept that things might not be what you expect, so you shouldn't take expensive risks. You'll have better luck buying many small, affordable items from Temu than you will shopping for more expensive products on the app. So, things like phone chargers, bags, and bracelets work out well but I would never buy a power tool or piece of furniture from there. Overall, Temu is not a scam. Read the coupon fine print and you'll know what to expect, so don't get too excited when you see huge coupons. Odds are you won't get any cheaper than this without having to wait weeks ordering directly from China. If you heard about Temu and were immediately familiar with its business model, go for it! If you're unsure and you haven't shopped like this before, wait and learn more before buying from online stores like this, that way you'll learn how to find out which products will line up with expectations.",5,06/07/2024
"I normally don't buy from companies without doing a background check of the web store. I tested two purchases at this Temu.com in Dec. The first purchased arrived on time before Christmas. Then I purchased again on Dec 30.  I bought a total of 12 items. They arrived on time, approx. within 10 days. The shipment tracking they provided were good. The discounts were all applied correctly. I did check carefully before the check-out. I also do screen shot for my purchases. I used the android apps for my 2nd purchase. The qualities of 10 items are meeting my expectation. Two items are OK in quality, since the price is so low that I really don't expect them to be of high quality, but they are useable. Overall, I am happy with TEMU and will buy again. I am working on a video to share my shopping experience with Temu.com  on my  YOUTUBE @DIYUSA channel. Sorry to hear some buyers are not happy with their purchases. I give them 5 stars for now!",5,06/07/2024
"I love Temu. I have placed at least 10 orders since November 2022 and have loved every single item. I buy computer cords wires and shoes. I find the service better than Amazon and the prices are far better. I now first check for the product on Temu before looking anywhere else. I have bought things for my children including stationery and fun erasers et all. I have bought shoes, water bottles, pens and decorative items and have loved every item. I also bought Apple Chargers and computer chargers from this shore. The delivery has been prompt and I once I even got a refund for an item that wasn't working as well as it should. Temu's customer service based on this refund experience has been great.  I recommend Temu.",5,06/07/2024

"It's been months. They always have hundreds reasons to ask me waiting. Now they said it is my bank's problem because I have set up a dispute. But my bank told me, they refused to answer the bank's request. So the dispute was failed and Temu used the reason to hold the money. Each time I asked them, they always said they are working with a special team and asked me to wait. Not confusion they just don't want to refund to me.",1,06/07/2024
Well....I have ordered twice and had great experience.   I bought a lot of smaller stocking stuffer items like self threading needles.  Handy household gadgets... etc.  So much fun to see all the stuff.  Items arrived earlier than expected.  First order my bank did check with me but it was no big deal.  Fun stuff for cheap prices.  Would I buy big ticket items that I would want warranty....not on line usually.  Site is FUN!!  They have delivered as promised.,5,06/07/2024

"If you are tired of getting price gouged, give Temu a try. I bought a steering wheel cover from another, much more famous website first and paid 3 times as much.

"Temu made my day! Today my first purchase of Temu arrived and I'm shocked at how fast the shipping was, how good quality everything was for the price and just how I hadn't known about this business till this year. I found Temu by searching on google for keychains because everywhere in Hawaii is so expensive for a little keychain. I ended up getting a rainbow cloud keychain because I wanted a more positive and joyful year and as I shopped, I found pajamas, a cute cat and donut plush and more items that I'm so thankful to have. I'm going to remain a customer and share about Temu to my friends and family. Thanks for your business! Blessings.",5,06/07/2024

One or two poor reviews every now and again okay....  Your reviews are HORRIBLE and so many 1 stars !! Needlessly, I will NOT Be ordering. Loved the clothing style too so disappointing.  If you wish to keep me, please contact me. I will request you send me all items and once received and I confirm all items are in the order you can then run credit card.  Betcha you won't so this...Thank you consumers who take time to post reviews, because there are scammers and just poorly run companies out there.  Glad I have not been taken!",1,06/07/2024
"I discovered Temu last December and now I am on mg 5th order and is now totally addicted that i'm creating a list for my 6th order! This site is amazing! The prices are unbelievably low plus free shipping! Wow! How can you beat that? Before I was addicted to Ebay and Mercari but now my attention is shifted to Temu. How I wish Temu started years earlier, I would've saved tons from buying the same stuff but more expensive prices at other shopping sites. Almost all of the items I got from Temu are of good quality and looks and functions exactly as what is advertised. There may only be 2-3 items that are quite meh but the rest are mostly okay. I have been giving positive reviews with videos or photos of the items I get. I just kind of wish Temu team rewards those that give glowing positive reviews so it will encourage more people to give feedback.Thanks Temu team!",5,06/07/2024

I'm not entirely sure why everyone is claiming this is a scam? I've ordered from them several times. Ways get my packages but EXPECT DELAYS. THIS IS ALL COMING FROM CHINA. It takes a couple weeks sometimes more sometimes less. Not any different then SHEIN. Which everyone is obsessed with. They refunded my one item immediately that I didn't like but overall I've liked everything I've gotten and didn't have high expectations for them to be the best quality because.. hello.. it's cheap. The same stuff you get on Amazon for a higher price. Also cheap but they are selling for 5 times the price lol. Some things I get I absolutely love and ARE great quality. Some things I'm glad I only paid a couple dollars because then I don't feel so bad when it hits the trash. Overall it's kind of a gamble because some items really truthfully are nice!,4,07/07/2024

"I was nervous about ordering from Temu because of so many bad reviews. However, I took a leap of faith because of many positive reviews. I ordered 2 electronics organizers, 2 cord holders and a pen/marker, sticky note desk organizer. My items arrived within 2 weeks. I received ongoing text messages advising me of the status of my delivery and it arrived just when stated. The items were well wrapped and protected against damage. The quality of the items is not high-end, but neither was the price. It was appropriate for what I paid. I don't usually leave reviews, but wanted to give a good one since the company performed well.",5,07/07/2024

"I have been Bamboozled before I had the same experience with another one of these fake ass sites,cheap yeah, trash yess, straight to the dump it went, never again, sorry y'all this chick ain't it.then it's hard to get ur money back,it's sad you pay money and then you get trash,no thanks",1,07/07/2024
I love this website. I been ordering off this site for almost a year and never had any problems. But I ordered a item with 2 of the same product and they only sent me one. But other than that I love this website and I will continue I have been satisfied with everything that I?€?ve ordered if u r reading this y?€?all owe me a satin blue bonnet. Thanks so very much love y?€?all,5,07/07/2024
"Some of the products that I ordered were exactly what was pictured on the website.  Three or four of the items I order are pictured as SETS of items, and it is very difficult to know that you are ordering just one of the sizes of the products.  Not exactly a scam, since I did get what I ordered, but the website is very misleading.  I am certain that the company will respond to this review with a generic ""We're sorry for your trouble.  Please contact us so that we can discuss this with you"".  There is not need to contact them, however, because technically I did get what I ordered.  The site is simply misleading for some of the products.",2,07/07/2024
I must say that I was skeptical about ordering from this company because I didn?€?t know them and the prices were so low. I ordered a few things for my granddaughters and they appear to be of good quality and they arrived on time. I just placed my second order. Very nice selection,5,07/07/2024
This is a best platform.. Good working ??????,5,07/07/2024
"Compare to Amazon where I shop the most, 99% of my orders are of good quality. They all arrived on time. Even for the returns, the process is so smooth. The customer service is also friendly and efficient. I have no complaints about Temu but appreciate it!",5,07/07/2024
The problem I am having is the return label and trying to get help for these returns. I usually don?€?t deal with sites that give me a hard time but I was told that this is a new company do I?€?ll wait and see if I need to change my Rate.,3,08/07/2024
Security public storage on Pulaski highway is very clean and secured.. Great deals..,5,08/07/2024
"Yes, it takes a bit longer to get the items, but they have a wide selection, amazingly cheap prices and when I've had a problem, they make it easy to return or even tell you to keep it and give you an immediate refund. They stand behind their merchandise.",5,08/07/2024
When the deal is too good think twice. Your first order will always be good and you'll receive your product.After that they'll start to send you FAKE coupons e.g spend $100 and get $40 off. But that won't be the case...and their customers care won't be helpful at all. They'll tell you that will apply to the next order which is not true.I'd rather stay away from this app!!?.,1,08/07/2024
I have placed many orders but have never been able to use coupons dated for January. One was $12.00. Please check my orders made today 1.8.2023. Either reprocess the order to include the $12.00 or send me a check.Order# PO-211-839998073264,1,08/07/2024

"I love Temu!! I've ordered several times on with absolutely no issues. I am a crafter and this is definitely the place to go for beads, molds, and other supplies. I love the flash sales, I got amazing quality beads for .89 that would have cost me $9 at Hobby Lobby. I don't mind the 7 to 10 day wait because of the savings. Crafting is expensive.",5,08/07/2024
"Updated 1/14/23After a couple more emails Temu refunded $20 to my credit card and still said I can keep the credit they gave me, and use it at anytime. Although it took awhile to get it all straighted out, in the end they honored the coupon.  I will order from them again if I see anything I would need on their website. Updated 1/11/23Temu sent me a credit for my next order.  I haven't tried to use it because I dont need anything. But hopefully they will honor that credit.  Date of experience: December 29, 2022 I was shopping online.  A spin wheel with discounts come up. I decided to play and got a $20 off coupon for my order. I added the coupon to my order. The checkout summary page said that my coupon would be applied before the order was sent out. I checked my credit card online and the coupon was not applied. I first used the chat feature to talk to a CS Rep. The next day I called CS. The day after that I chatted w a CSR through email.....Long story short, all reps said they could not apply the coupon because it was only good for 2 days. I told them I used it the same day I received the coupon. They said I that I didn't. I am very frustrated and as soon as I get my order I will be returning at least $20 worth of the items I bought.  I wont be purchasing anything from Temu again. I dont want to deal with a company that won't honor coupons they promise customers can use.",1,08/07/2024
"I have read alot of reviews on Temu both negative and positive. I have first hand experience with this company  as I began purchasing before Christmas. I took a risk and sank nearly all my Christmas money for gifts, spending it with Temu. Hoping and praying they were a legit company and my 8 grandchildren would receive their gifts by Christmas and that the gifts would be worthy enough to give to them. A week before Christmas I started panicing and contacted Temu concerned about my large order that hadn't arrived. Representative Candy responded quickly to console my concerns and check on my order. I felt better after our chat. I contacted Temu again 4 days before Christmas still concerned and Coco was comforting and helpful and assured me it would soon be delivered. The next day my very large box arrived with all 8 grandchildrens presents inside. As I opened each present I was so grateful for Temu for being honest and trustworthy to their word. Each gift was perfect for each child. Book bags that were cheaper than anywhere here in the US yet unusually beautiful and well made. Watches for the boys that looked like a Rolex of great quality. Jewelry for the girls that was beautiful along with socks, gorgeous scarves, pretty hand knitted gloves and the coolest hats. Yes they came in plastic bags but who is worried about the bags they come in? This decision cuts down on expenses by using cheaper wrapping. Thus allowing cheaper prices for you and I. The product inside is what you are buying and everything I bought was given as gifts and if they would not have been of good quality they would not have been good enough for my precious grandchildren. Thank you Temu for making a wonderful Christmas for my family. Inflation here in the US has gotten so ridiculous that without Temu this Christmas there couldn't have been a Christmas for all. My advice is to be wise when looking at each items description as Temu is diligent about providing accurate descriptions on sizing, weights, and materials used. So it is up to you to read the descriptions thoroughly. I know now how amazing Temu did over the Holidays because they were getting pounded by US consumers with orders, complaints. Questions, I don't know how they kept up enough as to even find time to respond to my texts but they sure did. Shipping was not in their ball park once it leaves the warehouse yet they were trying to handle millions of customers like me worried about their packages. Wow! Great Job Temu, Candy and Coco! Yes I am one satisfied Grandmother with Temu!",5,08/07/2024
"I have become addicted to Temu and that is my only complaint. I have made about 6 orders and for the most part have been extremely satisfied at the quality/price ratio. I have found things I never knew I needed and now wonder how I could have lived without them. The few disappointments have been well -handled (i.e. suction cups that didn't stick). I have bought kitchen equipment, clothing, office supplies, and cosmetics.  I am a FAN!",5,08/07/2024
"The quality so far has far exceeded my expectations. Delivery time was great. Not Amazon great but Temu is a different kind of company. I am very pleased to date. But I have 1 question, what type of metal is used in the ""silver"" jewelry ? Will it tarnish quickly & turn my fingers green ?",4,08/07/2024
"I purchased a jacket and it was too large.  I placed another order for a smaller size, which fits.  I was provided a return label for the first jacket.  I dropped it inside the post office, in their mailbox.  It has never been seen again.  I've chatted with TEMU customer service 4 or 5 times.  I am always told how sorry they are for the inconvenience, and they have informed their supervisor.  THAT IS IT.  Nothing else happens.  I filed a missing package claim with the post office twice and both times they say the package was never scanned.  I'm assuming it had something to do with the label I was sent.  I have basically paid TWICE for one jacket.  If I created the return label, I would think that it is my responsibility to follow up on this.  But since the label was sent to me, it should be the responsibility of TEMU.  The worst customer service from any company I have ever ordered from.  Do Not buy anything from here.  I just did the chat AGAIN, and it ended as usual ""We take your concern seriously, we have forwarded to our supervisor for further assistance.""  Then you never hear from them again.",1,08/07/2024
"I had 42 items in my first order, totaling less than $200.  They all arrived, and on schedule.  I got just what the picture said - however, the pictures make everything look bigger!  Some of these things are just tiny.  You get the item, but it is mini.  Like the ""towels"".  Note: when you check out, what items have become unavailable since putting in cart are left for notifying you when available.  So things can pop up in your cart again after you've cleared it all out!  I also note that I had trouble getting it to take my regular USA credit card 3 out of 5 attempts (I have ordered twice now).",4,08/07/2024
"I would purchase something if Temu didn't use pornographic song for advertising. I don't know the name of female singing but, the lyrics are clearly about a penis. Either you folks don't understand English or did it on purpose.",1,08/07/2024
"I can't review their products cause haven't recieved yet. What I'm displeased with is I was promised $30 off coupon after my first order shipped. So it shipped and I'd like to submit another order but the promised coupon isn't showing up anywhere. Very disappointed because it's the reason I made my order larger than planned. I'm very excited about the wide variety of items Temu carries and I excited to get my first order. Is like to make another order, but I'd like to figure out how to access the promised coupon.",1,08/07/2024
"I have never ordered from this company and never will. My 7 year old was playing candy crush and a Temu ad popped up playing Freaky Girl by Nicki Minaj. I reported it to Google. Same ad popped up for me when I was playing another game, multiple times. I have reported twice to Google, but fat lot of good that's going to do, I'm sure. In case you haven't heard this song, as I hadn't and are wondering why I'm upset about this, these are the lyrics my 7 year old heard:""I can lick it, I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin'I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside itYou can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss itAnd every time he leave me ?€?lone, he always tell me he miss it""I see from a scan of other reviews, we are not the first family to have this experience. Fix this ad now Temu.",1,08/07/2024
I had numerous items in my shopping cart yesterday and ordered them. I get an email today stating that I had left items in my cart. When I went and looked the items that I really wanted were not included in my order and had went up significantly in price. Beware to anyone buying from this company. They beat you in with good prices and then Jack the prices up before you can order them.,1,08/07/2024
"I have bought over 15 orders from Temu and I think the company is great. A few things are cheap, but way better than the dollar tree way better than harbor freight excellent customer service and the best prices I?€?ve ever seen you might have a few people that don?€?t like something. Free",5,08/07/2024
"I enjoy the products as well as the beautiful clothing , shoes ect. It's nice to get quality for a fair price. I'm always getting compliments on the fashions. I recommend Temu for savings and quality.          Cecilia",5,08/07/2024

"I was skeptical because of mixed reviews and super low prices but decided to give them a try. At this prices and with free shipping I would not be too upset if it did not work out. I ordered a few handy little items, and all went well. Quick shipping, well packaged, no problems with billing. The items are as expected. Reasonably good quality. I will be ordering again.",5,09/07/2024
I placed my very 1st order with them 8 days ago. My order was to be here between the 6th and the 12th it got here on the 4th period I ordered anywhere from diamond art cat toys kids toys I just went through all of them they are all perfect thank you very much I will definitely order again,5,09/07/2024
"Based on the negative reviews here, I had low expectations.  I also didn't order anything expensive.  I ordered some press-on nails.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Within a day, I got tracking numbers and was updated regularly.  I got my package within a week. Impressive, especially around the holidays! The nails were of typical quality and as described.I think this company is legitimate, but one should always be conscientious in checking item size, color, etc., and be realistic about what to expect when paying a price that seems much lower than expected.  Also, bear in mind that international shipping can be problematic.  Overall, I am delighted!",5,09/07/2024
I've had a ton of fun buying his from temu.  My biggest complaint is how addicting it gets.   I went into it looking for cheap cheap stuff  because my expectations weren't high.   I got some very nice things. I love my hats knives knife sharpener plush toys gloves frying pan and dice.  The bath exfoliating glove fell apart after 2 uses. The knockoff pokeballs were bad.  I got some good stuff.  I got some poor items and was given immediate refunds to credits to my temu account.  I didn't have to send anything back. 90% of what I got arrived on time or early. It's very important to read descriptions especially regarding size.  They definitely sell knock-offs so pay attention to details.,4,09/07/2024
"I ordered clothes, shoes, jewelry, and small kitchen gadgets from Temu.  I used a ruler to measure my foot before I bought the shoes and they all fit.  The clothes fit and the jewelry was nice too.  The items all looked like the pictures and were of good quality.  I could not believe the whole thing, so I ordered again. I ordered more jewelry , hair comb, and more shoes.  I had the same great results.  The kitchen items (ladel, meatball roller) were of a dollar tree quality.  All other items were a very good quality even the earrings were a great quality even though they are costume they look real.  I have told my friends and family about Temu and 2 others have ordered and wear their clothes and shoes.  All look nice. All items arrived in 3-10 days too.",4,09/07/2024
"I RECENTLY WROTE A REVIEW ON TEMU, I AM NOT GOING TAKE BACK WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE COMPANY, WHAT THEY DO IS EXTREMELY WRONG THEY PHOTOSHOP PICTURES AND THEN WHEN THE MERCHANDISE COMES TO YOUR HOME IT'S DOLLAR TREE ITEM MATERIAL!

AGAIN, THANK YOU TRUST PILOT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT YOU!",1,09/07/2024
"I am a new customer. I have only received a few items as of now, but am generally impressed with the prices and quality. In some cases the pictures are a bit misleading, such as a watch I bought which showed a picture with a curved reflection, indicating a domed lens, when the lens was in fact competely flat. That seems misleading.But In my first order I bought a smart watch that is supposed to show my blood pressure and pulse rate, connect by bluetooth to my iphone, play music,  text, etc., etc. Pretty amazing for under $20. But I never got to see if was really good because when I got it it would not turn on. The incredibly tiny printed reference sheet said to charge the battery. It did not say HOW to charge the battery, and included no cable. I ""Chat"" ed with their support line, who were very slow, then said they would refer the problem to a supervisor. Didn't hear any more from them.So I tried every cable type I had (USB C, USB mini, Lightning)  that could possibly fit in the tiny slot that looked like it was supposed to be where a cable would insert. Also tried a wireless charger. Finally I decided maybe the slot was so a fingernail could pop the back off and replace a button battery. I tried that and it opened, but the display immediately separated from its cable, ruining the watch. I am not complaining about the quality of the watch. It may indeed be amazing. But it went in the trash before I even put it on because of a lack or a serious user manual. Temu really should provide a more than a token ""user manual"".",1,09/07/2024
"Just got a email saying this company is flagging my review I have two days to respond or review will be taken down. I placed an order on Dec,10th  2022 and here we are Jan 2, 2023 and still no package had arrived. My Son probably forgot about the CHRISTMAS GIFTS AT THIS POINT.",5,09/07/2024
"I was going to be first time buyer.  I down loaded the app and was purchasing over $150 of items.  I was trying to apply coupon APPO79 to get $40 off, with the purchase of $100 or more.  The coupon is good through 1/3/23 and I'm told that I can't use the coupon because it has expired. I called and email  & I also chatted. I will not be purchasing anything with this company as they mislead their customers with false promotions!!!",1,09/07/2024
"I have received, in eventuality, every I ordered from this site. One of my orders had 0 movement for almost the entire month of December. Most of it was gifts for my children, but I spent less than 40 and got multiple small things. This in no way was going to make or break my families holiday, luckily for us! That said, the order had been placed with quite an amazing coupon (30 off an order of 60). After there had been no movement for 15 days the entire order was refunded. Including the coupon. I was able to place a new order with different items hitting around the same price. The end result is me getting around 120 dollars retail worth of items from temu for just a little over 30. Obviously, this outcome makes me very happy. So why the 4 stars instead of 5?Their customer service representatives are either vastly incompetent or only allowed a very few responses. When I would contact them with a specific query, I was pretty much always given copy-pasted response. My specific questions would be ignored. I was excruciatingly patient throughout that process as I was contacting them at least every other day prior to the holiday. I believe the combination of my persistence as well as eventually losing my patience (which does not mean slinging insults or being exceptionally rude) is what led to the outcome i received. However, the whole process of trying to communicate in any way of significance was fruitless and aggravating beyond belief. Long story short, order your stuff and just wait. It WILL come. Just maybe not when you'd like it to. With prices and deals like these though, it's worth the wait! Just don't get your Hope's up on anything happening when you contact customer service.",4,09/07/2024
"I think I just bought multiple items because they were super cheap, not because I actually needed them.  They seem pretty good though.   I have now filled my ""gift closet"" with a bunch of randomness - mostly because the items I received are MUCH smaller than they appeared in the pictures.  They probably put the sizes in there but I just went by pics so that was my fault.  Communication was good.  Shipping time was good.  Overall, meh.  Probably should have just saved my money though.",4,09/07/2024
"Just ordered from them using PayPal as the safest payment method and it was canceled due to payment failure. I've never had issues using PayPal.I think they're just harvesting info, beware! Don't download their app and never use credit card info when ordering from sketchy sites.",1,09/07/2024
My order finally arrived and everything was better than I expected. I was a little mad for it being a week late than the promised date but they made up for that by refunding. I will continue purchasing from Temu just not when I am tight on time.,5,09/07/2024
"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!This company is a scam and ships Chinese products with very poor customer service!! Stay away and buy USA!!!I ordered 3 items on Dec 16 and received only one on Dec 22. The package was ripped at the bottom and the other 2 items were not there. I waited until Dec 31 because I thought they were in a separate shipment, but they never came. I reached out to customer service, only could live chat, and was told that I would receive a credit and to reorder. The next day, ,the email said the credit was denied because their warehouse says the items were shipped. I will never order from them again!!!!!!",1,09/07/2024

"As u can see in my previous complaint one of the reps said to email him, i have and no response.  I finally got in touch with someone through chat and they said i would receive my credits within 3 mins and still nothing. I have already contacted BBB, made the complaint here, working on filing something with attorney general and trade commission. This is ridiculous that an order gets lost, call ups they say contact the company and ask for a refund and still nothing. What does this company intend you to do use ur hard earned credits and lose them. God forbid if this was my bank card...I have referred a lot of people to Temu and used those credits for christmas shopping but well some items never arrived and having one heck of a time getting my credits back...I'm giving until 4pm this evening to have my credits back if not then i will be taking further action..Sincerely, ANGRY CUSTOMER",1,09/07/2024
"I wasn?€?t quite sure what to expect!  As someone else stated, I too was pleasantly surprised.  My shipment arrived before Christmas and the items were better than expected.  The only issue I had was that a few items were damaged.  Temu should invest in sturdier packaging.  I reached out with my concern and was immediately sent a return label for the damaged items for a refund.  Overall great experience and would definitely purchase from Temu in the future.",5,09/07/2024
"A little slow shipping in first package due to Xmas. However, I received a full refund in Temu credit and got to keep the items when they came in. Very pleased so far.",4,09/07/2024
"I was VERY hesitant to buy from Temu, because I've had bad experiences with other companies taking my money and not shipping anything...or shipping a fake item.  However, I did indeed receive my order.  And despite the low prices, everything I got was great quality.  Two items (rings) didn't fit properly, but Temu was quick to refund my money for those items.",5,09/07/2024
"I wouldn't recommend this company. I have made my first purchase this Oct 2022 for a few kitchen items. But afterwards when i made other purchases of around $150, 98 % of the items are the worst quality i have ever experienced in America. The description of items and photos looks nice on their Temu app. However, the real merchandise are of either like miniature or with very poor quality. They won't last more than a few uses. Many are with bad designs. Unless you like to through away your money( even itemd seems extra cheap) , do not buy from them. I lost my confidence in this 'junk' grade company. Even a small piece of dishcloth doesn't absorb water or dry the counter surface at all. What's the use of it.They stuffed 38 items in one mailing envelope and it's torn open when arrived. Things got losen from packages or damaged. Oil spray bottle will topple because of wrong design. (The top is heavier than the bottom.)Small bottles with loosen lids. If you use it, the lid will fall off and the content would spill everywhere. A electric brush that cost more then $30 comes with paper thin brush pads.Dishwash pads deteriorate even after a few use.Sensor lights stopped working after a week.A spatula with bad designed angeling that it will hurt your wrist after using it to cook a meal. A small holder will be broken from it's frame if you put anything in it Please take my advice and don't waste your time and money to buy from them. It's a ""national shame"" from China.I am waiting for my refund and if they don't do it right, i might have to write a letter to the President of China Mr.Xi to warn him about what's going on with this Temu.",1,09/07/2024

I've called and asked your representatives to help me stop them coming. Apparently I'm supposed to create an account with the app then go through several steps to stop your very offensive invasion into my life and I will not do that. I am going to report you to Google, to the California Consumer Affairs office, the Better Business Bureau and anyone else I can find. You are truly a disgusting entity.",1,10/07/2024
"Edit: Temu's generic response has nothing to do with what my review is about. I never mentioned anything about a particular product...my review was regarding the price hikes and bait and switch free shipping on all orders gimmick.I previously reviewed Temu and rated them 5 stars. Well, those 5 stars are no more. I firmly believe that this company is nothing more than a bait and switch. In the beginning, the prices were great...not anymore! The price hikes are ridiculous! Items that used to be a certain price are now 3 and 4 times higher. $28 for a toddler dress that used to be $7; $18 for a toddler dress that used to be $5? Umm, no! Not only this, but Temu is still advertising free shipping on all orders...that's a lie! There is a minimum of $10 to get free shipping, which I don't mind, but I don't like that the company doesn't say this until the checkout process. Be upfront with the shipping minimum! I definitely regret the 5 stars I gave before.",1,10/07/2024
"I placed an order with Temu and when I received the package, the stuff inside was completely wrong. I reached out Customer service multiple times to either send me what I ordered or issue me a refund, but all was denied by then and they claimed that they verified on their end and all the items was shipped to me. I don?€?t know how they can verify that, as I never received what I ordered. It?€?s so difficult to get a hold of their customer service that you can chat with a live person, as all of it was automated response. So disappointed and will never from them again. Such a scam",1,10/07/2024

"I just recently order and item from Temu.  After placing the order the money was instantly taken out of my account, that was two days ago.  I just received a email and text from them stating that they have cancelled my order saying due to unusual payment activity when this is the first order I have made with them.  Now they want me to verify my payment method.  The customer service does nothing to help except show you the same information that you can pull up on the app yourself.  Either go back and give me the item I order or give me my refund or a class action lawsuit will be filed.  It?€?s that plan and simple.",1,10/07/2024

"I have ordered lot of stuff, I mean a lot, well.. I do get some bad deals, like shoe and clothes size and some time material but I always got my refund very quickly, no issues, they really are quick and honest.

"Alright, so. I have ordered before on Temu, and I was reluctant though I checked that it was a reliable website. My order was recieved on time, and I was satisfied. Then came my next order. It was all good until I NEVER recieved updates on my tracking order. I got very anxious that it wouldn't even come but waited. It was set between 12/20-1/3 and it arrived today, 12/30. I give this 4 stars because you did not keep me updated and decreased my reliability towards you. But overall legit and good to use moderately!! (I wouldn't be dependent that they would arrive on specific dates btw, because I've seen people here get mad their order didn't arrive on Christmas, partly your fault so don't put your anger on them) Thank you Temu!! Also a question, are the credit card gifts legit? Have a good one!",4,10/07/2024

"I have placed several orders so far and have been happy with almost everything. I?€?ve ordered over 100 items and only ONE wasn?€?t good. I contacted customer service and I immediately received a full refund for the item. The shipping can feel like forever, but it almost always comes within the quoted timeframe. The one time it ran late I was given a $5 credit for the inconvenience. Additionally, when part of my order ended up being out of stock, I was refunded and given another $5 credit.  Can?€?t speak to others payment issues however, as all my items have been free from the referral credit programs.",5,10/07/2024
"This was a test run.  The order arrived on time and complete.  The quality of items ordered was satisfactory considering the low price but nothing to brag about. --Items listed in the catalog look good, but lack e complete description such as measurements making it too easy to order the wrong item.",3,10/07/2024
Same items cheaper than Amazon. I don ?€?t mind if they delay shipment later than expected as they give a $5 compensation.  Return was so easy and free.,5,10/07/2024
"8750So here we go. I was able to finally get some of my order yesterday, Dec. 28th.  I'm still owed another package, but for the most part the items were ok. I wasn't satisfied with the socks because they were small/short. That being said, everything else was well made. I think this was due to the assistance of a Chris Chen. He sent me a message after my initial email. He explained the company and apologized for the delay. That's all good, but I think some constructive observations may be helpful. Customer service number or communication must always be visible, a larger wearhouse with extra holiday employees, stock on foreign items before hand if possible. Shipping??? Well although it's free sometimes the cheapest becomes the dearest ( most expensive). Your products are great and thank you for satisfying my frustrations.",3,10/07/2024

"I have been satisfied with all my orders from Temu. I have ordered a variety of things from a plush toy to crafts stuff to clothing. Everything has been correct to what I ordered and arrived within the promised time frame. You can't expect 2 day shipping with this site especially with the free standard shipping, it is coming from CHINA. Some of the products are average like one of the tops I bought. Some are really fantastic quality for the price like a pull-over hoodie and a USB-charged emergency light. Be sure to read both item reviews and shop reviews if you can and order a few weeks before you need your item. They will encourage you to buy a bit more to be more environmentally friendly but if you spend at least $10 this is not strictly enforced.",5,10/07/2024

Went 4 days with out an update and the after it arrived in the mail they updated the tracking. I'm very happy with the items I received and placed a second order. I still get free shipping.",5,11/07/2024

All they are doing is blaming USPS for my package not being here. Everytime I ask for a refund they send me a message like ?€? We take your concern seriously and have forwarded it to our supervisor for further assistance. We will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience!?€?!!! They been sending me this message everyday., I?€?ll never order from them again because they are very unorganized and very unprofessional, don?€?t wanna take accountability of their mistakes and don?€?t wanna give a refund.

"I have ordered 6 times from Temu in the past couple of month and some orders arrived later than others while some products were hit or missed. To be fair, Temu has good prices but not necessarily great products. You need to know that you get what you paid for and expect to wait 2-3 weeks.The worst nightmare is two days after I placed my last order (my PayPal went through) and I got an email saying they are canceling my order due to ?€?unusual suspicious activities?€? on my account. I was asked to submit a photo of my bank statement with my credit card # on, photo of my government ID, and a photo of my credit card in order to process my order. If this doesn?€?t sound like a cyber identity theft, I don?€?t know what is. We all know that no merchant would ask you for that kind of personal information if they got paid through your banks. Please don?€?t be blind sighted by the fabricated online pictures and low prices published. Identity theft would cost you more in a long run. Shop wisely.",1,11/07/2024

I thought the company was in China the way they were reacting, but they?€?re located in the US (according to their website). Who knows with them.  Stay away!",1,11/07/2024
Terrible seller and customer service. I received a wooden puzzle with missing part. Very frustrated for the activity doing with my kid during Christmas break. I cannot return the item for free. They charged $7.99 for shipping. Not to mention the time and effort we put into the project. I asked them to simply send me the missing part. Customer said they opened a case and asked me to wait for 48 hours. After 48 hours they are still asking me to wait with no ETA provided. Customer service never responded since then.,1,11/07/2024
"Recently made an order on December 15. It came on December 27th.

It's okay to use it. Please use this credit card again so I can get what I ordered. THANK YOU",1,11/07/2024
"Initially I thought all the items looked very cute in the photos so I decided to order all my nieces and nephews gifts from temu. When the gifts arrived they are are very very poor quality. I returned the items that I could see with my eyes that were cheap and still gifted other items that were boxed. I didn?€?t think to open them up but was reached out to after from the people that I gifted to that the toys were broken and scratched up as though it was priory used and returned. I called Temu and explained my frustration regarding this and asked for a return label, and they tried to ask if I had inspected the items before I gifted it out? And refused to give me a return! Horrible service. Do not buy, it?€?s a scam and the materials of their toys are worse than the $99cent store toys. Stay away!!",1,11/07/2024

"Most of the clothing I ordered was perfectly fine. Fit great and was made out of great material. The rest was still good quality material but it did not fit. My oldest daughter is 2 and wears a 2t. I purchased a 3-4y and they were still too small. I only got a 3-4y because the size guide said that would fit for her height. Obviously not. And reviews on the website for those items said they fit great. Odd. My younger daughter is 8 months old and wears a 9month. Most of hers fit but a couple were too small as well. I purchased 6-9 month. A lot of the toys I picked out look a lot bigger in the pictures provided. A couple look like they?€?re pretty large, but when they showed up I could hold them in the palm of my hand. And yet some looked exactly like what was advertised. I did order a car radio though, and that is perfectly fine. I do have to exchange it though because I bought the wrong size. The one thing I?€?m irritated about though is how long it takes for delivery and the fact that after your first return you have to pay for shipping. The items are pretty cheap. But they come from China so I would end up paying more for the shipping than I would the item itself. This is some wacky company and I honestly think it?€?s a gamble. You?€?re either going to be overly satisfied or extremely angry about your purchase. I won?€?t be ordering from them again. I don?€?t have the time or the money to be wasting on this.",2,11/07/2024

"My first order came with no issues and arrived before the estimated delivery date.  However, I placed an order on 12/9 and 12/10, the Temu app said shipped but the USPS says it?€?s still waiting on the package.  I reached out several time to customer service and received the same canned response that everyone is getting now in the review.  They did ?€?credit?€? the funds on the 12/24 and 12/25 when the package were supposed to deliver but I didn?€?t want a credit, I wanted a refund. I reached out to customer service and they said it?€?s been refunded to the original payment but can take up to 14 business days?€? so it?€?s the waiting game for now.  I did take the credit on the 2nd order and reordered again on 12/26 to give them another shot?€? Update: So far, I am getting shipping updates from my order on 12/26.  This is promising.Update 1/5/2023:Temu made everything right since the missed deliveries.  The updates on shipping could be better but overall I am very please with how they handled the late deliveries and my order from 12/26 was delivered on 1/4.  So note to self, try not to order during the holidays.So, I will definitely order from them again.Update 1/19/2023:I have made 3 more purchases from Temu since my last update on 1/5 and I did not have any issues with payment and all my products arrive on-time.  Everything I order was exactly what I expected.  Again, note to self do not order during the holidays due to potential shipping delays.",4,11/07/2024

My orders arrived with missing items and I can't get my refund and I even took a picture of the package. Customer service is no help ... seems like chatting with a robot. I gave it a 1 star only because I cannot give 0 star.,1,12/07/2024
If I could give this less than one star I would. I ordered $157 worth of items that were to be delivered before Christmas and lo and behold nothing has been delivered to date it is now December 27th and my grandchildren did not get their Christmas gifts and the gifts that I bought for my daughters did not come either! As far as I can tell there is no customer service because there is nothing but an automated response when you try to get in touch with them! It was minus 14?? and I had to go out in treacherous weather to go to Walmart to get what I could at the last minute so that my kids and my grandkids would have something to open on Christmas morning! I am so angry at this company and I would never order anything from them again and by the way they still have not gotten back to me on customer service! I have not received my items and the $157 was already taken from my credit card so now what do I do! I'll tell you what I will do I will leave as many reviews of this crappy company as I can so that no one else has to get sucked in by it! Because other than that there is not any recourse and you won't get your money back and you won't receive your items!!!! This company is a fraud and a rip-off and shame on them!,1,12/07/2024

"Placed my order on Dec 16th. On the 19th I received an email saying my order shipped. HOWEVER... the tracking still shows as if today, Dec 26th that usps hasn't received the package yet. I have contacted temu customer service 4 separate times now and gotten every excuse possible, including them blaming the post office being slow every time. Ummm, how can they deliver something they haven't received yet?! Real nice to not have Christmas presents. Had they actually shipped of the 19th like they said I would have had what I paid for. We should all file fraud charges with our cc companies",1,12/07/2024
"Very disappointed. I paid extra for faster delivery and was told that would insure delivery in time for Christmas. I have not received my delivery that included many Christmas gifts. I was promised $13 if not on time, so where is it? They can't get your order to you as promised but they can sure blow up your email begging you to order again. This is not a reliable company.   Update: I finally got a $13 credit not a refund because my order did not arrive until after Christmas. This does NOT make up for all of the Christmas gifts that were in that order that I did not receive in time to give them for Christmas, and does NOT make me feel any better about having to do a lot of last minute shopping and a lot of extra expense to buy more gifts to replace the ones that did not come as promised BEFORE CHRISTMAS.",1,12/07/2024
"I just ordered on Dec. 18th. My order was ""refunded"" on Dec. 20th. Who knows how long that process will actually take before my credit card account is refunded? When I inquired with customer service why this would happen, I got zero real response. My chat experience started at 2:06 pm. I finally received communication from Darwin, offering to help at 2:35 pm. Whatever, it's days before Christmas, and they had a convenient queue countdown letting me know I started at 252 in the waiting line. I wasn't particularly in a hurry, so I waited it out. I asked Darwin why my order was refunded, and I got the same stock answer twice: ""In order to protect the safety of your funds..."" Listen, Darwin, I heard you the first time, and you still haven't actually told me why my order was refunded. PayPal was happy to pay it, as was American Express. So anyway, Darwin was no help. He told me he had informed a supervisor and ghosted me. The customer service did not get better from there. The ""supervisor"" responded two days later with the exact same non-response and ended the chat. TLDR: You MIGHT be able to get a good deal from TEMU, but I would not count on actually receiving it or getting any actual customer assistance if you need it.",1,12/07/2024
"This company processed the orders quickly and I was impressed that they were delivered sooner than I expected. I really like most of their products and their prices are great. For that, I give 4 stars for their service and products. Unfortunately, I do believe that there is a possible loophole in their security system. When I read one of previous reviews about credit card being hacked, I thought that maybe it was just a coincidence. I am very careful when it comes to ordering online and I never ordered products from unknown/unfamiliar companies. Since this company had so many interesting items that I was so attempted to purchase, I decided to try it. Sadly, right after I ordered their products, my credit card got hacked in and purchase of 191$ was made the next day (4 am). Luckily, my bank got the red flag and locked it. Followed by the fraud, my email was automatically subscribed to unbelievable amount of strange websites and made me very nervous. Luckily, I didn?€?t lose any money (thanks to my bank) but I had to cancel my credit card which was very inconvenient to reset some of my payment methods. After that, I read through more reviews and found out that same things happened many times from other costumers before. Also, I did not make any other purchase using this credit card around that time. I don?€?t believe that this company is a fraud, but I do think that they need to protect the buyers better by finding out how the hackers hacked in. There are so many products that I really want to buy but I am afraid to make purchases. I hope that they can provide safer way for customers and for themselves.",2,12/07/2024

They look pretty nice and as fast as kids feet grow, I'm sure they will last. The wallet I bought is leather and is well made. bought a couple of rings that are very nice for the price!

Yes they have cheap prices but the goods are low quality for the most part and they do offer a $5 discount on your next purchase for late delivery but what good does $5 credit do when you aren't going to waste your time and money buying from them again? Then you have to message their so-called customer service who lie to you saying the items were shipped but the tracking number shows thy were never received by USPS. I told them to just cancel the order finally and they told me I could ""keep the items"" which unless they suddenly accidentally ship them I will never receive anyway.Dec 25th 2022 updateTemu is claiming they have ""refunded my money"" now yet after telling them I was not going to shop there ever again they are trying to give ""Temu account credit"" meaning they are trying not to refund my money. Honestly in my opinion these people are no better than crooks so DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!",1,13/07/2024
I placed an order on Dec 10th and Dec 11th for a total of $216.00. Both orders shipped or so I thought. Tracking didn?€?t move AT ALL! I contacted TEMU 3x was told 3x that it shipped. I finally contacted USPS I was told that while shipping labels were created the orders were never shipped. I called TEMU and they tried to tell me again that the items have been shipped I told them I already spoke with USPS and only the shipping labels were created. They tried to offer me a $5 credit for each order. It?€?s Dec 22nd and the orders were 90% Christmas gifts for my kids. I?€?m not even sure what to do now. Getting my money back takes 5-7 business days and Christmas is in 2 days. I DO NOT recommend ordering from this company. You have been warned. I also made a complaint to the federal trade commission.*A little update* I emailed Chris Chen I did receive an automated response. Unfortunately this guy isn?€?t real either. Packages still haven?€?t moved as of 12/23. Also nothing on my informed delivery.,1,13/07/2024
Don't Trust This CompanyThey Said they delivered my stuff and it never showed up on my porchSo I did some digging and talked to my main mailman and he said he didn't deliver no packageHe went to his supervisor and no package was delivered confirmTalked to my neighbor and he said no package was delivered on his security camera across from my house confirmedSo I called the company and wanted to talk to the supervisor and they said he was busySo I put in report to BBB so now I have a case numberNow I'm going to put a law suit in after the holidaysMerry Christmas losers ????,1,13/07/2024
I have purchased many things from this company and have never been disappointed.Great or reasonable quality at great price.,5,13/07/2024
"So unfortunate I wrote quite a few amazing reviews on here for your site. Anyone can see them. Then same thing that seems to happen to others, happend to me. If an item doesn't show up. You will not only not get your  5 dollar credit for it being late. (It was supposed to arrive no later than the 18th)I placed the order on the 3rd of December -not only will you not get your credit. You won't get a refund. All you get is we'll get back to you. We'll get back to you. It's really not the money as much as the principle. I didn't want to dislike TEMU, I didn't want to empty my cart and never shop again. Which I will not. I was shopping daily. Not anymore. Not since then. Ugh I hate being wrong. I defended you. I showed up here on three various occasions to write amazing reviews. Which, for the record, I didn't have too. It's not only the principle and of course the money, it's insulting to my intelligence to know another culture is laughing in my face while they continue to say ""we'll get back to you. Hope you have the nicest best life "" It's so insulting. I'm so glad I never referred you to friends. Ugh I'd feel so bad. It's shocking... It's quite pathetic.  For 15 dollars you'd lose a really good customer? Someone who really spent, and valued your company? For 15 dollars? Really? Keep it! Glad it wasn't more. Could of been worse. That insulting snicker is infuriating. Sad, really sad. I liked the site. Don't do it! Don't even download it. Aggravation you don't need. Shrug Michelle",1,13/07/2024
"Low Price for Low quality. Bought 2 jackets, amazingly cheap prices. For the last 40 years, I have beeb a large. Well these jackets are medium, but the tag says large. The hoody will not close, the chest almost did not close.  One time use today 12/22/2022 Winter Storm.  I zippered it once. It will not unzipper. I was trap. I had to force it open, it is in the trash, where it belongs.  Temu just told Trust Pilot that my statement is false and to erase it. Here is the Order (#PO-211-09783079567990489) I am real and alive.",1,13/07/2024
The only reason I'm giving a one star review is because I cannot give less.  There are shops on this site - Jing He to name but one - selling journal kits they have stolen from my shop and they are getting wonderful reviews for my designs.   This is really sickening!,1,13/07/2024
I got a credit card statement with unauthorized transactions from Temu. Now I am in a battle with Temu. They say since my addressed was harvested I still have to pay for things I NEVER ordered. So I am going back and forth with them.  I refuse to pay for something I didn't order. So again I have to call my credit card company and go thru this again.,1,13/07/2024
This was my first order and everything arrived in a reasonable time period. I was skeptical about the quality of the items when  I ordered but was pleasantly surprised. I will order again. Ordered 4 items and received all of them. Very happy!,5,13/07/2024
I ordered $150 2 drones and a handheld gaming device for my Grandkids Christmas! I ordered on Dec 4th Says they shipped on the 7th! NO THEY DIDN'T!!!!! USPS SAID THEY NEVER RECEIVED PACKAGES JUST A SHIPPING # NO PACKAGES  IF YOU TRY AND TRACK THEM IT STILL SHOWS AT USPS BUT THEY ARE NOT THERE! THERE A BUNCH OF THIEVES AND LYING SOB! I HAVE BEEN CALLING TALKING TO CUSTOM SERVICE WHICH IS A CALL SERVICE FOR TEMU NOT A CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! THEY CANT DO ANYTHING !!!!!! ITS ALL A SCAM TO USE YOUR MONEY TO PROFIT OFF OF! ITS A JOKE!DONT USE TEMU!DONT USE TEMU! DONT USE TEMU!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!,1,13/07/2024
Ok so here?€?s my update everything is on its way was worried but my items will be here in time for Christmas patients is a virtue it?€?s coming!!!,5,13/07/2024
"Canceled my order due to ""unusual payment activity "" but they have no option to see what's going on on my bank account so it was just senseless",1,13/07/2024
"Temu is a scam artist company!  A lot of their products advertised as wool on the title.  But if you ask the customer service, or when you get the item, there is no wool in the products.  Customer service told me a product is made of cotton, and when I got it is polyester. Temu promise you free gifts when you invite enough friends to download the app, but the counter resets so fast and many people said they never got the gift.They give you coupons, but it expires in a few hours.  They also kept on canceling my orders that used the coupons, so the coupons expired without been used.  I asked customer service why they canceled my orders, they would claim it is for your security protection but I feel that is a complete lie. They want my utility bills, proof of residence, and credit card statemets to restore the order, but when I gave it to them, they kept my orders as canceled without telling me why.  It's been a month, and they kept ignoring me.  But they didn't refund my money for every order they cancelled.  So they took my money and wasted a month of my time.I feel they are just a bunch of scam artists that cheats you left and right.",1,13/07/2024
I have extremely happy with Delivery and the products . Thanks Temu!! Arizona!,5,13/07/2024
"UPDATE: 01-14-2023After much time spent trying to get my Nintendo Switch order confirmed,  processed, and shipped, I was finally successful.  While, TEMU never updated the item's price in my cart, I did manage to find the correct coupons codes to apply the original discount to my item.  I received the Nintendo Switch per the promised shipping time.  It was in great condition.  I haven't ordered anything further yet. I'm undecided if I will order from Temu again. WARNING!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I DON'T THINK THIS SITE IS  LEGITIMATE. I THINK THEY ARE PHISHING FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ACCOUNT INFO. EVEN THE PERSON, CHRIS CHEN, THAT RESPONDS TO THESE REVIEWS DOES NOTHINGI ordered a Nintendo Switch and used ""Afterpay"" for payment, as it was an option at Checkout. I received $100 off plus a $50 coupon, which made the Switch OLED system only $204. After confirmation from Afterpay and Temu, the order began processing. 2 days later, Afterpay sent an email to me stating that my refund was processed. Temu canceled my order abd stated it was because of suspected Security Issues. I began chatting with ""Customer Service"" but it was a repeat over and over that it was being reviewed by a supervisor.  I was informed to replace the order and my price would be matched. After going back-and-forth with the ""Chat Service"", I was able to place the order again at the same price. I used Afterpay again, and the order was verified and processed by both Afterpay and Temu. Afterpay withdrew the money from my checking account again. Nonetheless,  two days later, Temu canceled the order again, claiming the same Security issues, but not specifying what those were.  A call to Customer Service provided the same result.  Now the item isn't available at the same price.12/22/2022 UPDATE:In response to Chris Chen's reply to my review, I provided him with my cancelled order numbers and copies of the messaged shared between myself and Temu's online ""Customer Service "". I will update this review throughout.12/23/2022 UPDATE:I received a response from Chris Chen. He said the payment problem was fixed...REALLY? Well, that's all he said. No promise to provide the item at EVEN the same price I previously paid twice. Considering the amount of time I've spent, another discount would be expected from a legitimate business. STAY AWAY, FOLKS.",2,13/07/2024
"How do I return a damaged order? The item has small black stains on one part.  I do not recall the exact date I ordered it, but it was in late part of November or early December, 2022.  It was charged on my card for $15.99.  PO# 21113403173706231087",1,13/07/2024
"Bought a smart watch on eBay from Temu and gave it to my nephew. There is a link for his Apple phone but when he tried to use it his phone rejected it, claiming the link was associated with fraud and identity theft. I recommended that he toss the watch.Re Temu reply: I gave the impression I bought the watch from eBay. EBay has no record of the purchase but Temu does. So, I don't believe that any ""resellers"" were involved. I made the purchase when alerted to the product by an ad placed by Temu on eBay, not from eBay's sellers.Temu should have checked its website before talking about ""resellers"".

I?€?ve reached out to customer service, been told I need to wait 15 days for a refund, that they are combining boxes to save on emissions (what boxes are you combining I only have one tracking number, and that they take my complaint very seriously and a supervisor will help me. 3 hours later I?€?m still waiting for the supervisor?€?. I just want my order and my kids Christmas presents?€? :-(",1,14/07/2024
I ordered some things for my children for Christmas I received the wrong box and they are not trying to fix it. I spent close to 200 dollars and my children won't have a Christmas because of them,1,14/07/2024
"I haven't received the item for two weeks, and the package wasn?€?t shipped at all, the only thing they do is refunding for the order, but I need a $50 compensation for this delay! There is no excuse to not ship the package and keep it in the warehouse for 15 days. I want to know what happened, get my item back, and receive a $50 compensation, or otherwise, I?€?ll file a complaint to FCC. Their customer service does not do anything to solve the problem than providing fake information and giving refunds.==========An update on this problem from December 29th:I have finally received the package, and they fully refunded my order on the 19th, as compensation. I am pretty happy with the result, I received my package and got my money back at the same time, so great company. I understand that it may take more time to ship during the holiday season.",5,14/07/2024
"Temu has great deals and until recently my shipments have been getting to me in a week or two. I am well aware of the holiday rush so ordered my last small package on thanksgiving as soon as we pulled our secret Santa names. I was extremely worried when the package was late but in my experience Temu had wonderful communication and no other company offers me freebies just because my package is late. My package is finally showing in route with USPS and will arrive by Christmas.  I understand the frustration with packages ?€?stuck?€? for several days, but it is certainly not temus fault that all shipping is delayed this time of year. I read numerous bad reviews while googling temu delays so I felt compelled to give you guys some hope and Temu the good review they deserve.",5,14/07/2024
"If I could give 0 stars I would!  I ordered on the 1st of December and was given a delivery date of the 11 to 17th. They didn't ""ship"" it until the 9th, but only after I contacted customer support.  Science then it is just sitting that. The delivery partner is still waiting for the package.  My guess is that it hasn't shipped at all and they just created a shipping label to make it look like it has.  I honestly don't think I will ever receive this package.  I contacted customer service and they told me a supervisor would message me in 24 to 48 hours.  After 48 hours I contacted them again.  They said they were still on track to contact me in 24 to 48 hours. I told them it has already been over 48 hours.  I have had no response.  I tried to cancel my order but it only let's me return items that I have not received.  In the meantime they are still trying to get me to buy stuff from them! Are you serious? What a scam! Never order from them!",1,14/07/2024

I contacted them immediately and all they've been saying is wait 48 hrs time after time after time. I've asked for them to have a supervisor to call me and they've refused.

"Don't bother wasting your time, money or breath with this company.It is Xmas time, the 18th of Dec. to be exact. I ordered an order that was $163.36 on December 1st, that money was taking off my card directly after I placed my order; 11:03pm.They don't read your reply on the 24 hr customer service posts they send automated replies which only pissies you off even more. They offer a woping $5.00 credit to your account if your items aren't there by maximum delivery date. I had to call the USPS to hear that, that package was never mailed, meaning never tendered, Yet, Temu wants to say it was. Who do you think I am going to believe?They act like they give a s*** only to appease you and hold you back from making greater contact with corporate or such. These folks had the nerve to ask me to wait until Dec 24th to see if my package comes through. So basically they want a disabled woman, on a fixed income, fighting cancer to wait til the day before Xmas to see if this package shows up, all the while the tracking info has not been updated or changed at all since December 7th.So what they want you to have no time to get a FULL refund before Xmas day so your child can , NOT have a Xmas. I get paid once a month and on a very small fixed income so yes that means I have no ability to come up with money for presents or anything especially because my family is passed on, my husband took his own life so all I have is me and my child. Yet somehow this ridiculous company wants me to continue to wait, wait and wait!!This company is no different than wish, cheap stuff and awful customer service!They have lost my business and I suggest you think twice before doing business with these people! Corporations like these don't give a flying f*** about you, they only want you money. Than when they f*** up somehow you have to wait to get YOUR money back!!They lie about their merchandise, I have seen with my own eyes seller, selling meth pipes and bowl on their s***** site. I am just blown away at the audacity of these nasty companies who can get away with such horrible service, scamming customers and selling drug paraphernalia without any repercussions!Now I have to wait 5-7 business days to have my money put back on my debit card, which completely destroys Xmas!The only gift of a smile I get is in knowing God will handle people like this and these scamming companies.Judgement day is coming sooner than anyone thinks!DONT DO BUSINESS WITH TEMU OR YOU, YOUSELF WILL LIVE TO REGRET IT!We wonder why there is such evil in the world, it's because there is no accountability for such disrespectful manners and behaviors of people, let alone companies.So today has been 18 days since my purchase, I still have no money or package and I am beyond pissed off!!At least I have some outlets I can report this company too.Rest assured they will get what they deserve in the end.But they have for sure lost a customer and I'm gonna make it my mission to protect others from Temu!!You should be very ashamed in running a company like this!!Very amusing, they had me go back and change my words ( swear words) but yet they have no problem selling meth pipes and bowls LMAOSo underneath this review they ask if you would like to become a ""verified reviewer""DONT DO IT, it's only a way for companies to take your info and use it against you, trust me I know. You people reading this have rights and you don't need to give your ID or personal info to anyone!They talk about transparency yet, these companies aren't transparent to use in any way.If someone asks you for your info you do the same of them!What's right for the goose is right for the gander!!",1,15/07/2024

I checked on the order today and without an email or any other sort of notification that my order had randomly been canceled.  I've asked about to their customer service both with their chat service and their phone number and both resorted to deflect the topic altogether.  I never got an answer to why they just randomly canceled the order, it sounds like when a fast food place accidently loses an order.  Kind of feels like im being scammed for my card details.",1,15/07/2024
I?€?m going to make this a long story kind of short but the delivery carrier lost my package and when I contacted Temu support it took a couple days and about 3 of their associates that I?€?ve talked to and was promised a reorder or refund. At first I wanted a refund but I waited the 5 days and still no refund so I went back to contact them and explain I hadn?€?t received my refund but since it?€?s the holidays I?€?ll just reorder something. This is day 4 of their ?€?supervisors?€? looking into my ticket still no answers when I was already promised a reorder or refund! I have previous chat messages to even prove that?€?s what was said and I sent them through and they didn?€?t even acknowledge them. I always get a ?€?48 hours then come back and check?€? message and it was a lot of money I had spent.

I went & purchased the gift cards.  Can?€?t find out how to use it. No customer service info.  Nobody to talk to. You go in circles. But they sure know how to get you to pay for your purchase.  Really streamlined with no issues. Bum bam thank you ma?€?am. I?€?m wondering if they are liget?I am being asked for a reference number. No where could I find a reference number. If no reference number then I can?€?t complain or get the issue resolved. Terrible app.,1,15/07/2024

I called customer service who told me it was shipped, and the lady was talking to someone else about something personal while I was talking to her.

I purchased late NOV and item says in Transit since the 9 DEC. However USPS says the package was never really delivered to them. It is Christmas gifts.

Horrible customer service I decided to order my kids Christmas gift from here despite my better judgement. It?€?s now the week before Christmas an yet no update they keep coping and pasting the same damn thing. I don?€?t care about the 5$ they offer I want my kids stuff.

"First of all their gimmicks to get more people to sign up are false. I signed up for a friend. I link I got from my friend said accept the invitation and win $50. That never happened. I shopped around the app and placed 2 orders. I have not received anything yet but so far it seems legit. I did the refer 3 friends get $30 credit. It would not let me fill the last friend. It kept giving them a message saying it failed and too many people were using the coupon. So I probably won?€?t be using the company after I get my orders, because it seems scammy. It?€?s been days and the response was to start over and get more people to download the app. So basically they have no intentions of giving the $30. They just want you to keep spreading their app. And It says when your friend sends it to you you?€?ll each get $50. Never saw that either. And nothing that they offer is actually free, you have to add so many people, etc. It says ?€?literally free?€? but they are just false advertising.",1,15/07/2024
"Stick to Amazon. Package is a week late and it's lost. They can't track the package - it's lost! Told to wait patiently for delivery of items. No remedies to resolve except for a $10 credit - ridiculous! No refund or reshipment of goods. I requested that, but was denied. Previous shipments received were poorly packaged with large openings - surprised that nothing was missing! Stick to Amazon. Temu has the worst customer service!

"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE sums up everything perfectly. If I could give no stars I would. I placed an order with 20+ items (foolishly) and they split my order into 2. One part had 2 items and the second part had the rest. I will admit that the first part of my order arrived on time but the second part (still with more than 20 items) is currently ?€?in transit?€? with no further updates for the past week. I placed my order on nov. 27th and now it?€?s dec. 17th. I chatted with customer service and called their customer service number already. It was always the same reply of ?€?sorry, we?€?ll credit you $$ for the late delivery and get back to you in 24-48 hours with an update?€?. I?€?ve waited like they said 5 times already just to get the same reply after each time they contacted me. The items I did receive were of subpar quality but I expected as much for the price so I won?€?t complain about that. You get what you paid for but I did go for the express delivery, which I did NOT get. To anyone who is reading reviews before buying, don?€?t buy from Temu. Save yourself the trouble and just spend the couple of bucks you think you?€?re saving and buy it from Amazon or something. Time is money after all and I wasted nearly 3 weeks worth so far AND I still haven?€?t gotten my delivery yet.",1,15/07/2024
"Temu is NOT a reliable shopping online store. I ordered my items Black Friday weekend in November , expecting to get it by now Dec.18th. I received a lousy $5.00 credit for the lateness,which means nothing!If I don't receive my items by Wednesday Dec. 21, I will stop stop payment and reverse the charges through my bank.Both my husband and Father-in-law are attorneys and will investigate Temu for its authentication. They have false advertising and their business ethics are questionable.My order for the most part is stocking stuffers and needed asap!I spoke with a representative that pretty stated that she was sorry and due to the holidays everything is backed up. Temu knows its the holiday time and should have my order in by now.Today makes day 21 and my order has not been delivered.  Unacceptable and untrusty work ethics.  Again, my husband and Father-in-law are attorneys and will be investigating this bogus company. I am very dissatisfied!Also another representative was suppose to call me 24-48 hours after I spoke with the first customer representative.Needless to say I did not get the call.Temu lacks professionalism !Sincerely Yours , Mrs.Carmen Sharpe...angry dissatisfied customer.",1,15/07/2024
I ordered 2 ninja foodi air fryer xl at the end of October and still have not received them. They didn't mind hitting my checking account for the  money as soon as I ordered them. It will be 2 months at the end of this month and still no product. The ad said 8 to 15 days,1,15/07/2024

"Update: I did finally receive my package and everything seems to be in order.  The long shipping time didn't bother me so much as the tracking not being updated for almost two weeks.  Overall, everything arrived as described and intact.  I would probably order from Temu again, just maybe plan ahead more.  I placed an order Nov. 28th that was supposed to arrive between Dec. 5th and 14th.  The tracking has yet to be updated (has been claiming to be in CA since Dec. 3rd) so I don't even know where the package is.  Tried chatting with customer service, but it was a bot. I hope I didn't just throw my money away.",4,15/07/2024
"Great pricing but delivery is very slow. Made several orders with them for Christmas. Some of the items arrived but still waiting on a few orders. My problem with TEMU is how they are pushing their stupid climate change policies on everyone which holds up shipping. To anyone who doesn't understand that climate change is a hoax please do some damn research. Stop being mindless social media zombies and actually investigate the facts. I know many people these days, including our President, are immune to actual facts, but intelligent people know that facts are what makes up truth. Temu's policy of reducing carbon emissions is not only detrimental to a customers delivery time but also a false narrative based on lies and deception. Wake up people!Thanks for your response, but your reply totally missed the point. Let's try again,why are you forcing your customers to abide by your climate agenda carbon emissions policies when they are based on a false narrative and lies? Just ship us the darn packages when we order them.No response to my edit..guess you don't know how to respond. Figures. Stupid is as stupid does lol.",2,15/07/2024

It?€?s supposed to be between the 16th and 23rd. Im waiting patiently but my patience is really on the mend this package is for Christmas. And when I pushed the speed up button on there app so that carriers could get it faster I don?€?t think they tell you if it has or hasn?€?t speeded up.",3,16/07/2024
"Awful customer service experience. I havent  received my order, I have been waiting on a refund, or give me a clear answer about what is happening, they keep copying and past the same responses, ignoring my concerns.

I spent a lot of money and now I am still waiting just to know where my package is, no one is answering my questions, they just keep repeating that my concern was forwarder to a supervisor and they would get back to me in 24/28 hours, it has been 3 days now I jeep getting the same stupid answers.",1,16/07/2024

"Im on my 8th order. We love this online ordering that ships from the USA but its at Wish.com prices !  Maybe 5 percent of stuff we buy is meh but the rest is quality spot on and we are using it all and save so much money ! Just be sure to read what everything is made of, like fabric for clothes, take measurements and read specs carefully. In an age of inflation, we are using Temu to give us a good christmas and buy things for the house",5,16/07/2024
"BEWARE! I ordered from Temu last month. They said it was ""shipped"" on the 5th. I have contacted them and contacted them about my $227 order and they are constantly ignoring my messages through costumer service! The items I've ordered included Christmas stockings, stuffers and presents for my kids! The latest I was supposed to receive it was by the 17th. If I don't receive my package by the 17th I will get a whole $5.00 compensation. 5 bucks on a $227 order, really?! What a slap in the face! I called USPS today and since the 5th the only thing Temu has done with my order is create a shipping label. USPS hasn't received my package or even the manifest. Before anyone says it's Christmas time or it may take longer through the holidays... I've ordered over $400 worth of products through this company. I've received packages that I've just ordered 10 days ago already from them! The most important package (and most expensive) I ordered is still not here. Temu don't really care about their customers. I'll never be ordering from Temu again. I don't recommend them at all.",1,16/07/2024
"I love this new TEMU app. The refund/ return process is efficient and they provide excellent service. As long as you are not happy with the items, you can return it, and you don?€?t even have to pay for shipping to send it back. Currently the inflation problem is quite serious, you could save a lot of money to get many inexpensive practical products from this site. I recommend this website!",4,16/07/2024

I just spent a long time trying to find the perfect gifts on their website just to have all four of my recent orders spontaneously canceled, and I?€?ve been going back-and-forth with customer service (if you can call it that) for days and all they keep telling me is ?€?your item has been refunded?€? when the question I continue to ask over and over is *why* my orders were canceled in the first place. Very weird and frustrating experience.",1,16/07/2024
"Really slow, I called customer service 3times from morning to afternoon today. My card issuer already solved the card restrictions issue in the morning.

"Before I started. I have ordered from them twice , one is $269.33 . Nov 6th Second time is $110.52 Nov,8th I ordered $269.33 , 32 items . ( face products) Every item I ordered like 3 or 5 quantity so on app show me total 146 items  They ship with separate box , first box come fast like in 2 weeks .  Second box came like a almost month 11/26 or 28th But the second box came together with the other box ( the order $110.52 that I purchased on 11/8 ) I open first box surprise me with all messy like throwing out trash, everything looks cheap , outside face products box cheap with small word Chinese translations , quality not even worth our dollars store  .  I took out worth $31, (  6 items ). Then Return other all items , they nicely refunded $51 to me , I talk to support is the wrong amount they refunded.  And told them I ordered $269 why only refunded $51 . I keep repeat over and over again for the story , then they told me I didn?€?t send it back all the items after 2 weeks .  I was so confused, the things just hanging there because I?€?m tired to go though the different support everytime . After almost a month , I got another 2 box?€?s ( the $269 other items  and the second order $110 ) then I find out they ship with separate items . very amazing that all the items buy or return and tracking are in the system on the app  clearly, they still don?€?t know what I am talking about ,  so I end up with Have to ship back all the box?€?s , the $110 and the second box that they was mentioned it , I told them open the box please to see what I resend you back in the box and count them . So you can give me a refund, They just keep saying you return one item . Where is other box . You didn?€?t return it all ?€??€??€? it make me very crazy .  when I found support , nobody can help . They keep changing support . you need to speak your stories again and again and almost 2 month now ??? Nobody contact me back or care ,until today 12/16/22 the things still hanging there and I already tell about like 50 times of the story to 50 support .  Still  Nobody can resolve this problem . Worse customer service ever ever . After all this things and time , Dec 7th they refunded me another $41.37 and the app says I only returned one quantity , but I already return all the boxs .  They refunded $110.52 very fast .  But the $269.33 orders they just don?€?t want to refund to me , even now I still don?€?t know why they don?€?t open the box and count the items I returned. My friend told me when she see the first box , she said : oh my god , this is Our China call  swap floor sell , they only sell on the floor in the night market . even worse then dellers store , even when we was live in China we don?€?t even buy it because too cheap , what make them think in the US , US people will use it .  and they spend billion dollars for the commercial in the US trying to take over whole US market , very disappointed. Bad experience ever very shocked that the quality.  By the way their kitchen items is good .  Not beauty items . But their Facial mask I love it , Some of the items I think is still ok for use it a while , if you want to buy a stuff and use it longer, TEMU is not a choice . Only for my own opinion .  Thanks",1,16/07/2024
"Buyers beware!!! This company is out of china... Although merchandise is priced affordable, expect to either not receive your order at all, or have serious delays in shipment!! They will not refund your order. Despite spending almost $100 in merchandise from their site, I have not gotten any updates about my purchase and will only get a refund of $5. Their customer service is terrible and do not speak English. They claim to be shipping products from over 11000 locations globally, which has to be a flat out lie. I purchased multiple items so if that were actually the case, I would have multiple tracking numbers from each location they claim to have. I only have 1 tracking number meaning it is all coming from the same location... China... When I reached out to customer service they claimed to have shipped my order... But according to the tracking number they provided, the postal service still has not recieved it. Do not buy ANYTHING from this company!!",1,16/07/2024

"This site seems to have problems.  I had 3 fraudulent charges on my card.  When I looked into this further someone was using my credit card but set up an account with their email address.  Today a cheap pair of gloves arrived which I never ordered.  When I reported to Temu the representative was to email me information on how to report the fraud.  Nothing has arrived.  I would avoid this company.  Supposed to be legit but doesn?€?t seem to be.Update:  Emailed the person in the response, but nothing from them so far.  I?€?ll be posting back how they resolve this issue and the timeframe.Update 2:  After the second update I heard from Candy Wong who says all purchases would be credited.  Requested the gloves be returned but could only offer store credit.  If I open an account they would give me $10 for future purchases.  While I will not be opening an account, I will return their gloves since I did not order them.",1,16/07/2024
The children's coat and hat was perfect. The dog coats were labeled large but they were small. Gloves were all ok except for one pair that came unraveled.  This was my first order.,4,16/07/2024
"""You get what you pay for.""...with that in mind, I thought my package had not been delivered like it indicated on the tracking information.  After playing detective for a bit I located it in the garage (sitting by a lot of other boxes) where my husband put it after it was delivered by the outside of the garage and he neglected to tell me about it. I opened it to find lots of useful little gadgets which I had ordered and they were all manufactured decently and will be of great use in the kitchen.  I was quite pleased with everything.",5,16/07/2024
"In all I have ordered 3 times with Temu. The 1st order shipped ok, got it in 11 days. Looking back, I think that Temu makes sure everyone's 1st order goes smoothly so you will leave a good review or so that you will be suckered into ordering from them again. Well, I fell for it and I ordered two more times. One on 11/24/22 and one on 11/26/22. It is now 12/14/22 and the shipment update is still showing that USPS has still not got their hands on either of my packages. Temu's people always say, ""consolidating nearby packages to cut down the number of deliveries, , which is generally within 7 days and has been included in the estimated delivery time. Thank you for reducing carbon emissions with us."" If this is true, then why is it that my $260 worth of merchandise has still not moved?Temu customer service is a nightmare. The online chat will be responded to but, it is always the same response, ""We've expedited your request and are looking into your question. We'll get back to you within 24 hrs. Thank you for your patience."" 24 hours comes and goes and nobody responds, not until you try to chat again with them and get the same response all over again. If most of these items were not for Christmas, I wouldn't even bother with these people but they are and it makes time more critical. I ordered 1 month ahead of Christmas thinking it was plenty of time but, I guess with Temu I was sorely mistaken. If you cherish your sanity, do not go anywhere near this company because they will literally drive you crazy. Also, looking into this company I have read many testimonials about credit card scamming. BEWARE.",1,16/07/2024

"I received an order from Temu earlier this month and it was overall a very positive experience. All the items were as described and in great condition. No weird sizing or appearance issues with clothing items. Items were as described.Currently, I'm awaiting my second order of Christmas stocking stuffers, but they are running slower due to the holiday season. I do understand this, but it can be stressful not seeing an updated tracking number for the window of time. It makes me a bit apprehensive. However, I'm still in the delivery waiting period or I'm not worried. Their customer service has been helpful during this time as well.Anyway, I had a positive experience with Temu already and for that I am happy!",5,17/07/2024

Found temu from an ad on YouTube for a pair of waterproof gloves and free shipping for less than $10 I thought the ad looked scammy. But PayPal was supported meaning that the ad had some legitimacy. The tracking system temu uses is top notch. I ended up getting two pairs of the gloves and I felt that they were fairly decent quality at two pairs for less than $10. Decent winter gloves that fit fine. I will definitely order again.,5,17/07/2024

I couldn't wait 4 THEM, as they should have been here on the 3-4th.  I had to go & buy other items to turn into the church ,as they were due to be turned in days ago. So i spent extra $$$ due to this negligence. I wouldn't buy anything from here. You'll never get them. I could have driven to NYC faster than waiting for this crap. They also didn't apply my discount code at check out. I called daily, and service department was worthless tool. They couldn't tell me anything! Just horrible! Not worth the time aggravation or stress.  AVOID THIS WHOLE COMPANY. They offered me a $5.00 discount to buy more crap for my trouble ???????????????????????????

"Why would I order something else from your site when customer service blatantly lied to me about sending a message and refunding me for 200 G fish food. I received a message from them Stating that several days prior they sent me a message telling me they refunded me. So I scrolled up to the message thread to find that message on the date they said they sent it... Guess what it wasn't there... Pretty odd! They basically lie and cover for themselves. Don't play the fish game where you have to raise 7 fish to full completion to get a reward.. You will get 90% through the final fish and then you will stop getting fish food... Meaning no matter what you do you will never earn the reward. This happened 2 ??s to me. Then the support agent was extremely rude to me and kept repeating himself. Anytime I've created support tickets for an issue I never get responded.. I created a Support ticket waited 48 hours... Nothing happened! Created a support ticket for a support ticget told 48 hours, nothing happens. So I created a support ticket for support ticket for a support ticket, repeat. Then a support ticket for a support ticket for a support ticket for support ticket. The items I earned in fish land are a $10 PayPal card and a $20 PayPal card. However I get nothing. Currently temu owes me $30 in PayPal cards... What a joke... Maybe I have to create a support ticket for a support ticket for support ticket for support ticket for support ticket for support ticket before I get help. No matter what you do they will tell you to please wait 48 hours and they will compensate you... After 48 hours and not receiving any compensation or message you will have to talk to them again where they will tell you to wait 48 hours and then repeat that process indefinitely. Then they will change your information like your address or your log in name. It's downright horrible",1,17/07/2024

"I just received my first order from Temu, and I am over the top pleased with everything!!! I ordered Christmas gifts for children and adults, and some household products for myself. Everything is as pictured and described, and the quality is even better then I was expecting!!! The clothing is well made, and packaged nicely!

"I am absolutely BLOWN AWAY with the quality of the garments! I have ordered from other sights from other countries and have gotten what I expected and paid for, but THIS RIGHT HERE IS LEGIT QUALITY!!

"This is the same exact reply I received two days ago and STILL there has been no update on tracking. (I copied this from another response from 2 hrs ago) Everything they tell you is scripted Mine also had something about Thanksgiving and Black Friday and I called them out on it because I ordered AFTER those days.  It is very frustrating to order Christmas gifts and never receive them. I intend to report them to BBB and Facebook since FB is where I saw and continue to see their adReply from temu.com2 hours agoHello, your feedback is valuable to us. Most packages arrive between 7-15 business days. You can track your order?€?s shipping status on the Temu app and check with the merchant directly.If you find that your tracking hasn't been updated in a while since shipped, because we are consolidating nearby packages to cut down the number of deliveries, which is generally within 7 days and has been included in the estimated delivery time. Thank you for reducing carbon emissions with us.If your package does not arrive, you are eligible for a full refund under the Temu Purchase Protection programAfter posting original review TEMU responded and and gave me an email address to send all the order information. I did as they asked but never heard back from them. I requested a refund and still have not heard anything. PLEASE do not do business with this company which is NOT located in California ... the tracking info included information not on their site showing this is either a Hong Kong or Chinese business. Don't let them scam you out of your Christmas money",1,18/07/2024

"Arrived quickly: Ordered Nov 29, and all arrived exactly as described and well packaged. Fun stuff for a few $, so count me a happy camper.",5,18/07/2024
I've placed three orders with Temu.  The first arrived within the stated time frame and everything was of a great quality.  Still waiting on the second and third orders.  The prices can't be beat.  I already have 15 items in my cart for order #4!  And you can spend hours looking since Temu carries everything!,4,18/07/2024
"I made 4 different orders with Temu for Christmas and 3 of them have not been sent to USPS, but shipping label created and the last one is held up due to the supplier waiting for supplies. I asked what they were waiting for and I would cancel that item, but customer service couldn't help and said II would receive a call from a specialist today. The order was very large and over 230 dollars and I'm fearful it's not going to get here by Christmas..... I will increase my stars or decrease my stars depending on if they ship in time, if they call me back and if I receive all my items. Update: The company did call me and assured me the orders would arrive before Christmas. Three orders came in on time before the 2 week period and one order was late, but still arrived before Christmas. They also gave me 5 dollars credit because it was late. I was very happy with the products. They all came in individual packages within the boxes. Some products such as Jewelry comes in individual bags instead of the box as described. I absolutely love this website and will use them again several times. The clothing is very well made, but needs to be ordered a size bigger. I haven't had a problem with any billing issues with my bank and they have taken out 2 payments. I used Klarna at checkout that allows you to make a payment every two weeks and it's been great. I highly suggest Temu for everyone. Just remember if your looking for higher quality jewelry go with sterling silver, titanium or stainless steel.  The cheaper jewelry is not like the 25 cent gum ball machine, alot similar to retail stores.",5,19/07/2024
was seeing lots of ads on facebook so i finally decided to check it out. i actually had fun looking at all the items offered. i ended up with a 50 dollar order and decided to take my chances. i placed my order on november 28th and just received it yesterday december 7th. i had fun unboxing but did not expect really high quality so i was very pleased. only issue was a cat food bowl i ordered and the ear was broke off. overall very satisfied.,5,19/07/2024
I just received my order and I can not believe how awesome my products are !!!I was very skeptical honestly... the quality is amazing! My first time ordering anything from Temu but it will not be my last.  This is definitely the way to shop!!! I ordered on Dec.2 and got it today Dec 8.#5stars,5,19/07/2024
"I had ordered a few things from Temu and it is a legitimate website.  You do get your stuff most of the time.  I ordered 4 times from this website, and only 1 time my product did not arrive.  After two weeks, contacted Temu which they said they will refund.  It's been a few days now and still no refund.  They did said depending on my credit card company it can take longer.  So will wait for another week and see.So a few things about Temu and the products they sale.  Ordering from Temu is like playing Russian roulette.  It is a hit and miss kind of game.  Sometimes the product is very good and doesn't cost as much as from Amazon or other stores.  Other times, the product is cheaply made and you just waste your money.  I had gotten some very good items, and some not so good items.  So it is a gamble.  You can return the item if you don't like it, but if it's not your first time returning, you pay for shipping cost.  First time is on them.What I dislike most about Temu is their packaging practice.  Most of the time, like almost every time, they throw all the items you ordered into a plastic shipping bag.  When you received your package things in there look so beat up.  The item either falls out from the box it's in or if no box, it may have some physical damage during shipping.  I used to work at UPS distribution center and those package we toss them all over.  Sometimes heavier boxes sandwiched these plastic bags causing things to get damage.  Other times bigger box gets stack on top of these bags.  This usually happens when we get a bunch of smaller boxes from conveyor belt and we just toss them with these bags at the top after stacking the larger boxes at the bottom.  Note that most of these items you ordered are cheaply made items.  Once in a while they do carry name brand items or better quality items, and it's a steal.  So I say check Amazon and other stores and compare price and review there first, then check Temu.  Temu have a section for review, but most people don't give reviews. If the item is cheaper from Temu, then order it from there.  Comparing Temu to Amazon, Temu is like your cheap garage sale while Amazon is a warehouse.  So just beware that the product you order may not be up to standard.",3,19/07/2024

"I've seen some of the merch from temu my mother has received, and it seems about on par with most bootleg items from aliexpress/alibaba, which is fine given the price of most things. HOWEVER. I noticed when I signed up for an account (I did place an order -- I have yet to receive my items, but am anticipating the same level of quality) that the email I used was suddenly flooded with spam. This is an email I infrequently use and NEVER have spam in my spam email folder. But suspiciously, after signing up for temu, my spam folder is filtering 50+ emails a day, so I guess where we're at is the products for this site are fine, but they probably sell your email address. /shrugEDIT: thanks for the prompt response, temu! I feel the need to clarify: these are not temu domain spam emails. It's just generic spam. The timing was suspicious with my account creation/order, and after reviewing your Privacy and Cookie Policy it seems it's probably coincident with third party advertisers. As you explicitly state in your policy that you don't sell personal information for money, I can only assume the third party advertisers is where the spam emails came from. As they're filtered to my spam folder, it's not that big of a deal -- but people should be aware it's something that might happen. bumped up the start rating to a 4 for the prompt response -- thanks for keeping an eye on your reviewers y'all :-)",4,19/07/2024

"The site is legit, and I received my order promptly. Price and selections are very good  Return process was good, similar to Amazon's but not as smooth.  The reason for 3-star was their customer service, and shipping packaging.1. A large clock was shipped in  plastic wrapping, NO BOX.  So as expected, it arrived badly damaged. Never received anything from Amazon that was packed that way.2. The ""Support"" Chat  was a joke. The flow was terrible. When prompted to identify the item in question, it took me away from the Chat after I selected the item.. The Bot was stupid and won't connect me to a live agent.  At the end it gave me a phone number to call. It may have years of experience in online retail in CHINA, but it definitely does NOT meet my expectations, and in no way comparable to Amazon.",3,20/07/2024

I was supposed to receive a free item of my choice because of the referrals but did not. When I inquired, I was told that even though they ordered through my link, they didn't do it correctly so I don't get my free item. These people are not stupid; they are nurses, business people and teachers. They can follow instructions. Obviously the instructions were not clear but Temu refuses to contact them and explain what they need to do.  I'm very angry.",2,20/07/2024

"So, items ordered were received quickly with no hassles. The buyer must beware, however, what you see is not always what you get. Let's start with jewelry. The first image you'll see is of a lovely, handcrafted item. You will not receive that. To see what you will receive you must scroll through the images. There, most times, you'll find the actual item made in molds with inexpensive products. The price is fair for that item. But don't think you're going to get the real, handmade deal. Also, check your measurements. Oftentimes the images show a product in use and it appears to be the size you'd expect for that item. But if you check the actual dimensions, the item will be much, much smaller...to the point of being unusable. In the end, its buyer be very aware and know that what you see is probably not what you will get.",4,20/07/2024

I STARTED TO HAVE ISSUES AFTER THEY FLAGGED THIS REVIEW AND ONCE I SENT PROOF TO TRUSTPILOT OF THE ENCOUNTER I HAD AND THEY VERIFIED MY REVIEW MY ORDERS TAKE LONGER TO SHIP, AND I JUST GET SENT A SCREENSHOT FROM A FRIEND TONIGHT WHERE IT SAID ME CLICKING HER LINK DIDN'T COUNT BECAUSE MY ACCOUNT HAS BEEN RESTRICTED. They never sent me anything stating my account is restricted, and i reached out to their horrible customer service again and Carrie kept running in circles saying the games aren't available to me but i dont care about the games my concern is that they are sending notifications to my friends that my account violates their rules when I've done nothing wrong. Carrie just like the others was of zero help and obviously didn't comprehend what my concerns were just like the other encounter i had with them. While I've ordered quite a bit from them today all of a sudden I get messages to try and place 2 of my orders again after they already took the money. I reached out to customer service a few minutes ago and Aila was no help and didn't really seem to comprehend that I sent screenshots of being told I needed to retry my orders. First she told me to add the items to my cart and checkout and I tried explaining its already been paid for and even sent screenshots of that proof as well. Then she said it's normal for them to inquire which made no sense at all. I tried so hard to get her to understand what I was experiencing and she was very short with me speaking to me like I don't know what I'm talking about. I then get told ""but we have your order"" and she still didn't say anything about the fact I'm getting notifications to try and place the orders again when they're already paid and they took the money off my card. I got told she'll pass it along to management which answers nothing about the issues I'm having. Someone needs to actually respond that can explain why it's showing what I'm seeing about needing to retry to order 2 items when they're already paid for and its showing its being processed.

Love temu I?€?ve been using it for a few months I have bought over 300$ worth of stuff from them all have came on time and were as described in the website. Highly recommend temu my favorite shopping app by far!!,5,22/07/2024

"So far so good...recieved my order even quicker than expected.  Clothes seem to fit as they should.  Once I wear and wash the clothes, if they hold up great, I would love to give 5 stars",4,22/07/2024
"Actually had a good experience with this app, just check the reviews for items you want and pick out the ones that say the items have a good review, I also recently did not get a package, most likely stolen, and customer support refunded me. Bought tons of items from this app, pretty good quality also!",5,22/07/2024
"I am extremely satisfied with TEMU. My order of 75.00 came in about 2 weeks. Everything was of great quality. I ordered an array of items from clothes, makeup, shoes, kit hen appliances and pet items. Not disappointed in a single item. Can't wait to place another order!",5,22/07/2024
"THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I ORDER FROM TEMU. TODAY I RECEIVE THE BOX, IT ONLY TOOK 10 DAYS TO ARRIVED. I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS COMPANY.",5,22/07/2024
For a first time on the website I was given a chance to spin the wheel and it stopped on $100.00 coupon.  I made an order and was not given the opportunity to use the $100 but had to pay for the order.  What was the coupon for?,1,22/07/2024
Ok so I previously made a post about being nervous after placing my first order. I received my order today and I am extremely pleased with the merchandise. Everything went smooth and I love the things I received. Thank you Temu..,5,22/07/2024
"I was trying to order boots from Burlington but somehow got the webpage Temu which had the exact boots for the same price as the original so I ordered and paid thru PayPal. Then I read all the negative reviews and my heart sank because I thought I had been scammed. I got the tracking number that wasn't very up to date so again I was skeptical and very disappointed. Well today, not even two weeks later, my boots were delivered by the post office and they are the exact boots, same quality, correct size that I ordered. I am so happy that it was NOT A SCAM! I don't know if I can attach pictures but I'd love to show the nice packaging and product I received. This was my positive experience and I felt compelled to share it. I hope this helps.",5,22/07/2024
i am very happy with temu app  i received my order very fast !!!!,5,22/07/2024

"To update my previous review of temu.com, temu customer support contacted me regarding my issue. They offered refund, which was applied as credit to my account. I rated temu with 5 stars, because overall my experience has been excellent",5,22/07/2024
"I was excited when I saw the app. It seemed at first that Temu had things that sell on Amazon for 1/5 of the price. I was so excited!  I ordered about 15 different items. Baby shoes and socks?€?terrible quality. Not sure they will stay on baby?€?s feet.  Ordered decorations for the window. It is not cling?€?it is a sticker. Can you imagine scraping a big sticker off the window after Christmas?  Plus it was just shoved in the bag and was so wrinkled I couldn?€?t use it even if I wanted to. I ordered two ornaments?€?one was broken because of the packaging. The toys are described in centimeters ?€?find a ruler! Be cause the ones I ordered came back 1/2 the size. I ordered a puzzle that uses magnets inside. I?€?ve ordered one on Amazon and loved it!  These looked the same on the Temu app?€?but the paper on the outside was a sticker and will easily come off and most of the magnets on the inside have fallen off and the thing rattles.  Both are like that!  Everything I thought was going to be like what is sold in stores in the USA came small, unsafe for children and cheap knock offs.  I too ordered over $100 worth and had a second shopping cart full for a second order?€?after my big orange bag arrived?€?I deleted the app. Back to Amazon and Walmart.  If you do order?€?see what the measurements are first. And try to determine what they are made of. The product description are basically very short and not very helpful.  Lesson learned.",2,22/07/2024
"Ordered about $70 worth of infant items at the 1st of October and still haven't received my order but the money was taken off my card, and when I got a hold of them they said items had been delivered. But still haven't received nothing. Do not order from this app. It's fake. If they had a minus 5 on the rating that's what I would rate it. Scam",1,22/07/2024
1.Unable to cancel order.2. Refund only part of order price without returning tax.shown on their email..3. No refund received.They can collect back the returned items and donate to whatever organization they are interested.,1,22/07/2024
I had a order from temu for almost $300.00 they said $40.00 off because it was over $150.00 and free shipping  used my visa card and it said order couldn't be made now I've lost my bonus perks not sure yet if they have my info yet and if it will be on my statement but will update in a month very disappointing thought this was great for people living on a a monthly budget but guess not,1,22/07/2024
"My experiences with TEMU have been good!  However, I have come to realize it is safer to buy ""things"" over apparel as the sizes are often time wrong.  I have sent things back.  i am not a big  shopper but will probably stop after Christmas as I will not need anything.",4,23/07/2024
Fake transactions done in my credit card.Temu just simply do not answer,1,23/07/2024
This app is awesome as long as you're willing to share it to get the free credits. I've ordered over $1000.00 of stuff and I've been VERY HAPPY with everything I got except 3 things with they let you return FREE.,5,23/07/2024
I have ordered 4 times and am very happy with almost everything.  One small item i wasnt thrilled with but for such a low cost isnt a big deal.  Just got some pj's that are just great. Prices are awesome.  Will continue ordering from Temu.,5,23/07/2024
Placed a order the night of 11/16 for 3 women's sweaters and a winter scarf for $35. Used PayPal for the extra protection since I was skeptical about if and what I would receive.  Received the order 11/23.  The tracking showed that it was shipped and I received a text when it was delivered but no tracking info while it was on its way.  What I received was far beyond my expectations for the price.  I followed the items measurements to select my size and did not just choose my regular size.  Some items were M and some where L. Everything fit perfectly and such good quality.  One item was the same sweater as on Zulily!  Zulily price was $33 and Temu was $13 and with my 40% off coupon got it for $8!!  Plus Zulily shipping is usually one month!  Just placed my second order!,5,23/07/2024

"Have ordered serval jewelry pieces and one homeware item ,in addition I have ordered makeup and all was good quality and arrived on time.",4,23/07/2024
Thanks for offering people who cannot afford name brand that are just ? ?€? NAME BRANDS ?€? I am more than happy with each item I purchased. I read reviews saying it takes a long time for delivery? Ya so. Good things are worth the wait! I am personally grateful for Temu. To complain about HOW LONG it takes to receive ? Is just pathetic of a complaint. My socks I ordered are soft the sneakers I ordered fit PERFECTLY. The razor ? Best Razor I EVER owned for .50 No worries Temu and vendors you are doing justice for us grateful people. Doing great Temu I truly appreciate you. Bye bye Amazon ???? hello Temu!,5,23/07/2024
"After reading mixed reviews, I placed just a small order with Temu.com as a test to see if products were good and the company legitimate. The order came sooner than expected in a bright orange bag.  All items were there and in good condition when they arrived.   Temu.com has so many products from which to choose that it can be addictive.  Products are what you'd expect from a dollar store, but the price is lower.  I will definitely order again.",5,23/07/2024
"I bought several novelty items for Christmas. The order arrived in 8 days, providing transit info in the interim. One item arrived broken, a second was way too small. I contacted Temu and they issued a refund immediately. I was very pleased with the other items in the shipment. Overall a very good company to do business with!",5,23/07/2024
"While Amazon sizing issues have become much better than they used to be, TEMU sizing is actually far more accurate.  Items are of decent quality and because they aren't name brand, are much less expensive.  I've taken advantage of the free shipping for their Black Friday deals and expected much slower shipping than has thus far been the case.  All items have been as described.  Still awaiting a few orders, but no problems to date.  I think most of these reviews are from people who are expecting far too much for such a low price point on items.  Better quality than Wish or Ali Express and better shipping times.  Better quality than Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and even Five Below, unless you spend more for name brand items at those stores.",4,23/07/2024
"These people are scam artists. My order was ordered AND PAID FOR OCTOBER 31st. It?€?s now Nov 22 and it?€?s not here. Their customer service people are TOTALLY INEPT. After discussing this order with MULTIPLE employees they have no idea how to pull up those conversations and refer to them. They can?€?t find the order # even when you give it to them, they are deliberately obtuse and dumb BECAUSE they dont wish to find the overdue order OR REFUND IT as they repeatedly promised. They said they couldn?€?t find the order but AMAZINGLY found it 1 minute later and even though they agreed to cancel and refund, they sent a shipment confirmation AGAIN for over 20 items. They refunded PART OF THE ORDER FOR $2.00 and change! That entire order came to $147.00 and change and they deceptively twice said the order was shipped - once after I told them to cancel and refund my card. It?€?s a SCAM. And nothing they say is the truth. They?€?ll give you the run around. I got a message from them that?€?all they wanted to do was make me happy?€? then they BLOCKED ME FROM ALL FORMS OF COMMUNICATION. This is purely a Chinese fronted business with an ?€?office?€? in The US.##They sent a ?€?reply?€? not asking for anything. No information at all. I provided them with ALL pertinent information FOUR TIMES. THEY left out part of my address after using it successfully Three other times for other orders AND they dropped part of my email address off as well. THEN they blocked all avenues of reply to them. I?€?ve given them all they EVER asked for multiple times. All of this simply put me at the end of my patience. No way to reply to trustpilot.com but this. This is for trustpilot.",1,23/07/2024
Got exactly wat I ordered most sizes are exact but as with anything you order or buy always read the fine print something?€?s look bigger then what they are or you mite think you?€?re getting a doll but only buy doll clothes this is where you?€?re fine print reading comes in but the products are almost always as described very rare find for a affordable site I would def refer my friends and family and they have great prices on baby items and shoes go TEMU and customer service is amazing ty TEMU for being reliable and affordable,5,23/07/2024
I placed a small order as I was sceptical of the delivery speed that they had promised and of course the quality. I was amazed at both. On time delivery and the quality was fantastic. I have since placed 3 additional orders and had the same great experience. Prices fantastic also. I will continue to order as long as this company continues to meet my expectations.,5,23/07/2024
"Is a shopping app from China that sales daily product like household items, clothes, shoes, fake jewelry and etc?€? I had purchase some items from this app and is pretty easy to navigate, but products are hit and miss.  Some are okay quality and some are very bad quality( like worse than Dollar Store).  Products views are not organized like Amazon.  Views on products are hard to find n minimal. Buyers just have to take a chance if you really want something.  Shipping is not as good n fast as Amazon and so is Return.  Also refund is not given back in full if return something.  Some items will not allow you to return, so always check for return policy before you purchase anything from the sellers.  Over all, I feel like if you?€?re looking for good and high quality, do not buy from this site.",3,23/07/2024
"My order for an electric nostril hair trimmer came the other day. Took just seven days from the time I paid to reach me. The payment process was quick and painless. I liked that you can add items to the order after you paid, so you don't have two separate packages  when you can have one. Great prices. The trimmer cost 2.45$ and I checked that it sold for 7$ on Walmart. Over the course of the year, the savings can add up. Two thumbs up and will shop more.",5,23/07/2024
About the same kind of merchandise as wish.com but 10x faster than wish. Not as fast as a regular store however. I bought a lot of little trinkets and stuff and they were decent quality. Definitely cheap but for less than a dollar for each item and I didn't expect much. I am happy with my purchase and it came 8 days after I ordered it. Not as fast as Amazon but a hell of a lot faster than wish or Ali express.,4,23/07/2024
I love this app it is legit and sometimes arrive early then expected which I like I had ordered some led light they came with music you can play out of them and for the people who are just going off of what the reviews say please try it first,5,23/07/2024
"Honestly, I was not So sure, But I took the chance and I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER = I got what I ordered!Quality-made sweatpants & SIZED CORRECTLY!I was Satisfied & Surprised with The Quality of The Less important toiletries/Household Items !!I Almost didn't try it because of the W.T.F. experience I Had with W_sh! last or the year before...THANK YOU TEMU !!!!!",5,23/07/2024

"Beware if you don't receive your points from this game, they won't help you! I received over 4300 from one of my viral posts and they disappeared, after I clicked the wheel twice! I should have received 500 in credits, and all they'd offer was 50! (Which never was even applied to my account) Even after being on chat from 9pm last night, until 8:30 this morning. Absolutely asinine, just beware before sharing guys!",1,23/07/2024
"This is a legitimate business.  I got everything I ordered in about 10 days which is fantastic if it is coming from China.  I got a Snow White outfit for $3.99 with accessories!  The materials for the clothes are more thin than say...JC Penney but not much more thin than Walmart.  The kitchen item are as they described but cheaply made like the dollar store.  The prices are very very cheap so you get what you paid for.  I'm happy with my order!  I got 4 outfits for a toddler for like $20.  Some Lenovo ear buds for $5, and a really nice thing that fixes to a hanger with Velcro then has clips to hang baseball hats.  How many baseball hats does one man need?!  This will hang them all in one place and make Me happy they aren't laying all over.",5,23/07/2024
I'm so obsessed and addicted. I truly appreciate TEMU and their vendors. THANK YOU,5,23/07/2024

"I just made my 37th product purchase from Temu. Prices are fantastic, items are quality and shipping from China to me is 10 days are less. Had an issue with 2 shirts that were too big for me I didn't even have to send them back and received my refund back to PayPal the same day. Don't be scared. This site is addicting and I love them.",5,24/07/2024
"I placed my order on 11/7 and received it today. It was delivered when they said it would be. I am happy with everything I purchased. Will definitely order again! I was nervous after reading some of the reviews until my order was delivered. It's sad the world we live in with some trying to scam others, but I feel I can trust Temu. I am purchasing a few more things now.",5,24/07/2024
Customer service. Ease of ordering. Ease of purchasing. Delivered as promised.  Blouses fit as should.  Bottoms are not sized properly. If you are over 5'5 inches don't buy the bottoms.  Too short. Also I am a 10.  Couldn't get their size ten past my behind. They are made WAYYY small for a skinny petite. Blouses are made well and with quality and true to size. Kept every blous. Pajamas are not made true to size. Too small.,5,24/07/2024
At first I was nervous about ordering however I was happy with the quality of the things I ordered and it came pretty quickly! ???? I will be ordering again!!,5,24/07/2024

"I really don't understand why everybody says it's a scam. Yeah the stuff comes from China but it's EXACTLY as they advertise. Very good price and really did not take that long, not near as long as some of my orders from other companies have. I paid $17 for all of this stuff. Tons of Christmas gifts for the kids, all came very well packaged, all on time, all here. I am very pleased! This was not a scam. I did a test order to make sure and now I do plan on ordering a whole bunch more stuff. Please note, I'm a very real person, not a robot not an employee of theirs. My name is Deziraye Wald. I live in Denison, Texas, I work at the lake. You can look me up on Facebook. I'm writing this review because I don't have much money and like to find deals like this online to buy people stuff for Christmas. I'm a mom of 3 and I looked at tons of reviews and almost didn't order from them because of the reviews. I was very skeptical before buying from them because all the reviews kept saying it was a scam. Well I'm glad I checked for myself because it definitely was not a scam and everything turned out exactly as I ordered.",5,24/07/2024
Tried to order from temu website but my bank declined the transaction. Spoke with my bank in the AM and was told it was declined due to numerous issues with temu and my bank. Fraud alert was sent to my phone regarding this transaction. Buyer beware,1,24/07/2024
My experience was positive. The shipping was fast and the items were good.No problems. I would order again.,5,24/07/2024
"Never received my package although I received many tracking updates stating the package was in route for delivery. Reached out to the company and was advised to contact USPS. Went to my local post office for assistance. The package never left the region where it was processed. I was issued a refund and received an email stating I could keep the items I ordered, although I never received them. The company did not honor this statement, instead, the company had the audacity to offer me a $5 credit for my inconvenience which was a blatant insult. I asked the company to resend the package. They want me to place another order. I will not be placing another order now or anytime in the future. Fair warning?€??€??€?.stick to Amazon and Shein this company is not up to par",1,24/07/2024

My first order came in quickly and I liked my stuff then I put in about 4 I think orders and I've been watching the shipping I'm now getting nervous. USPS I have on my phone to track . It says it right in my area I get excited and then turns out tonight it's in Kentucky totally miles and mile away.  I'm upset I'm scared that this place is a scam,4,24/07/2024
"Don't order!  Their website says they will refund the original payment source but then they give you a Temu credit.  I've been on Live Chat for over an hour and a half and they won't see reason.  They are scammers.  The products are cheap cr*p and when returned they won't refund your money.  Not worth the aggravation.  I am disputing through my bank now.  They won't win.  I've cancelled the credit card, new one has been issued.ETA: I've sent Joy.lee all the information she requested and haven't heard back at all.  Refund not processed.",1,24/07/2024
"Haven't ordered yet, just wanted to inform people to ALWAYS use PayPal if it is an option!  The company does not get any card information using this, just a confirmation code via PayPal!

Temu is LegitI?€?m happy my with orders so far. Got more than 20 packages delivered to me in the last 3 weeks and still shopping for more!!!!,5,24/07/2024
"Update after talking to Temu representative I need to change my review I'm also less upset lol, Got my package as promised in 8 days which was nice surprise,I bought a couple of items very cheap and didn't believe they can be good but I like to give a shot, so I paid for my car Christmas Horns less than half of the same item on Amazon , couple different items what have the same quality as other stores but the price is not comparable, the refund was free for the first return I miss understood the rules, I do agree with Temu take if you want to return more items and you sending multiple packages the nest return for the same order you should pay for since they not making much if they pay for couple return of the same order that will destroy the business.the prices are nice but those guys are not honest about the return is not free, you pay $7.99 for a return which makes it not worth it. The item is cheaper than the return ...",5,24/07/2024
"I have been so pleased with Temu!. I ordered Slippers with bunny ears. Red size 8. and 2 pink Cat dreamcatchers. A few days ago. I am not sure why their order confirmations went to my main email address, but they did.  I could not find them because they went to spam. and believe that is why they are not listed with purchases on my acct: because different address.I do hope to have them consolidated!",5,24/07/2024
It?€?s been a month purchasing from TEMU and in my surprise and i am experiencing the best customer service and shipping and low cost price. Also a few items were missing during this time because I purchased multiple items from the same seller or different seller after i claim it I received my refund in minutes. Not even half an hour. It takes 3-5 minutes to receive the refund through pay pal . As of now very satisfied,5,24/07/2024
I placed my first order.  Within a few days I got notice it was on its way.  I could not believe it!  Items were more than satisfying and better than expected. The cherry on the top was the fast shipping. I have now placed several orders. My Christmas shopping is now a breeze.  The packaging could use some help as my box came in crushed but other than that perfect!!,5,24/07/2024
"Everything I have bought from Temu has been awesome. My very first purchase was a pare of sneakers, they looked great online but I know how that can be very deceiving so I didn't really expect much especially since I paid less then $4 for them. When my purchase arrived I was completely surprised, the sneakers were extremely well made and looked exactly like the pictures on the website. Every time I order they send me a receipt through email and send me a tracking number through another email letting me know my purchase has been shipped. So far I have no complaints about anything I have purchased and I have been purchasing through the Temu website for over a month now.",5,24/07/2024
"Wow, I just got my first order and let's just say every single clothing item I ordered was high quality and EXACTLY as pictured!! I got a few toys as well and they're great! I got a ton of stuff for just $20. Amazing. I feel like this place is the best kept secret.",5,24/07/2024

"Ordered last week, got updates when shipped and with tracking.  It came the day it was expected.  Prices do reflect quality but with these being a novelty item that will only be used occasionally I'm not upset by it.  I got 5 ugly Christmas sweaters for around $45 with a coupon that worked fine.  I also got free shipping.  I am going to place another order. I want to post a picture but can't.",5,24/07/2024

"I would like to say when I joined I got three coupons for 30% off for three separate times I would place orders. I used two of those coupons and everything was fine no issues with anything. Now it's Black Friday sales going on now and it says free shipping during this time, well I placed a large order and it used my last 30% coupon instead of giving the free shipping they promised for Black Friday and it still has 5 hours remaining before it runs out. I can't find an email for this place so I am very upset I feel like they took advantage of me. Which is sad because I would gladly keep ordering from them so would the 15 people I referred but now no one wants to do so because we don't want to be treated like that or be lied too.",3,24/07/2024
"Temu is total fraud. They showed my item shipped from Los Angeles on Nov 13 by USPS but USPS doesn?€?t have it. Also, I am only an hour away from the ship location in LA.

"final update;they requested for further information or my review will be removed... so as per previous update, i spent about 5 hours talking to customer service to try to get my referral credit back for a mistake THEY made by providing false information, today i just received my credit in the credit bank for the lower value item instead of the hairdryer. Miraculously the item that i originally wanted (hairdryer) but was out of stock yesterday when i completed my referrals is now back in stock.... at least i got partial credit back therefore changing my review from 1 star to 2 star. Note to company, if your customer service agents are not able to fully understand what a customer is asking, they should clarify or direct that customer to a different agent... not give FALSE/INACCURATE information.first update: the John guy...aka customer rep that lied about the credits reappearing...suddenly disappeared along with my credits and another agent Molly appeared and took over the conversation, initially she said that I required 12 instead of 6 referral to get the item which is NOT TRUE because I have PICTURES of the tracker that said I only needed 6 and then she had the audacity to say that the people I referred were not real people and that I had 0 referrals when there?€?s even profile pictures associated with my referrals. Additionally I know every single one of them and they?€?re either friends or family, the reason it showed 0 was cause the initial incompetent customer service agent (JOHN) told me to cancel my order resulting in me losing my referral credits?€? after 5 hours of back and fourth this agent stated she would credit me back the second items value but it takes 24-48 hours ?€? so I?€?ll keep everyone posted. But as a first time customer who recently placed an order to have to deal with something like this for 5 hours in order to get some type of resolution is unacceptable. Had I been told ""sorry you can?€?t cancel your vest to get credit back I would have been fine and kept the vest?€?"" but don?€?t provide false information to customers when you're customer support.... you job is to assist and provide support... don't just disappear, very unprofessional (John )original review:I believe this company is fraudulent, they offered the hair dryer if you refer 6 people after 6 of my friends completed the referral it said the item was sold out, I accidentally selected chose another item instead of getting the credit value for it?€? I decided to contact customer service spent OVER AN HOUR talking to a guy named John and customer service told me to cancel my order and my credit for the value of the item I originally wanted will reappear?€? so I canceled it and never saw my credit in the credit bank?€? afterwards he goes oh I can only offer you $5. Like this is unacceptable, how are you going to offer me $5 after you told me to cancel an item worth $17-20 saying my credits will reappear. If I don?€?t hear back from customer service I will be reporting this to better business bureau. I have pictures of my conversations with customer service as proof",2,25/07/2024
"Just to test the waters, I ordered a neck and head cover for cycling in the winter. They sent a tracking number promptly and I was able to track it the whole way. I'm very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy from them again.",5,25/07/2024
"I ordered several items.  My first order came in 4 days.  I loved everything.  Can't wait to receive my 4 other orders. I ordered large wagon wheel door decoration, can hardly wait t o see this.  I noticed Walmart had same thing at twice the price.",5,25/07/2024

"I have ordered twice and receive both orders, and I am happy with each and every item. I went in with eyes wide open, knowing that many or all of the items would be sent from other countries. I have been so impressed, that I shared both orders with coworkers, so they could see the quality and feel safe about ordering.I do have a small issue. There seems to be an ordering cap on several of the items I ordered. For example, I bought a pair of athletic shoes that are extremely comfortable.  I would love to order all the colors, however, there is a cap of one pair per customer! I would also like to order matching outfits for my grandsons. Again, one set per customer. Other that that, overall excellent experience.",5,25/07/2024
"The ordering was easy, so was the payments. I am having a BIG problem trying to make this last payment. Temu is not taking my card all of a sudden. I have put in 3 other orders. Card went through with no problem. Now it's a problem. I really want my order. H E L P...",5,25/07/2024
I ordered for the first time and spent $20. honestly I wasn?€?t sure if we would get our stuff cause reviews are mixed.They sent me a email with a tracking number. I was able to track it and today we received everything we ordered from them. We didn?€?t have any issues and everything we ordered was really cute. We ordered a bunch of stickers and a bunch of different sticky notes for our daughters.I would post a bunch of pictures but I don?€?t see how to.,5,25/07/2024

Kept asking me for screenshots &more info. Got the runaround including this unknown telling me, You don't speak English, you don't understand me. Their prices are so low with free ship, how can they sell sneakers for $6 or $8 with free ship.  I think they are hackers SCAM. I have reported them for internet fraud.  I think the 5 stars are Bots.  I doubt they have any inventory. Whats their game. Watch out!NOW, As to this Temu.com answer. They don't do anything. Why because they are frauds. Watch out. They have to be up to something. I have seen complaints of not getting product, no C.S.  & $1,000s being charged to the account.",1,25/07/2024
"Hi, so I discovered temu through a youtube advertisement or whatever so, I ordered clip on earrings and jewelry on November,1st 2022 and it delivered on November 12th but that's not the issue, I'm confused on the return policy and if there is one. The ""clip on"" earrings that I bought were ""zircon clip on earrings"" It was falsely advertised and my ears cannot be pierced because of their condition, I love the other jewelry and all but I want to return my earrings because they ARE NOT clip on earrings as the title never stated, maybe I should've looked a bit harder at the photos but I'm dissatisfied with my earrings and they are all the same, it's a rose gold pair, a golden pair, and a different pair but the title also stated that they were ""Clip On earrings"" Is there any way that I can return them or get my refund?",3,25/07/2024
"I bought lots of things. I do believe it is like wish or it is wish but sold in US. Everything is made in China. I bought about 50 items. Some cheaply made some made ok. A few lightly damaged boxes but I recommend it. I got the first delivery in about a week. Tracking numbers for everything, Things are smaller than they appear so watch for that.",4,25/07/2024
"I ordered some items and honestly, I had my doubts based on the reviews that people wrote. Half my items came today that were expected on November 17. The rest is on the way.

"I ordered two (2) items on Oct. 20th that I never did receive .

"I was skeptical, like everyone else. We've all seen the ""what I ordered"" compared to the ""what I got"" reports. So I did a small order just to test it out. I could've just been lucky, but my experience was great! The item came quickly and was of good quality. I wouldn't hesitate to order from Temu again.",5,25/07/2024

I think the company is fantastic from everything I've ordered. my packages arrive fast and just as described in the picture. they even went out of their way to issue me a credit for a package that didn't arrive on time and I didn't even have to bring it to their attention. I thought that was so awesome and just remember don't knock it till u try it. u will have a good experience...but u gotta place a order to do so.,5,25/07/2024
"I've had good luck with my orders from temu so far.  However, I think if you are going to sell to the US, you should make sure your vendors include instructions in English as well.  I ordered a lockable travel bag, for documents, etc and I can't lock it because the instructions are in Chinese.  Can someone help me?",4,25/07/2024
"I was so skeptical when seeing the prices and free shipping. I also thought it would take forever to get my order.FALSE! I?€?ve loved everything I?€?ve ordered and got every order within 2 weeks. I check their site first now to see if they offer what I want before ordering elsewhere because you will kick yourself if you don?€?t.

"I bought my g-son 2 shirts, I was not happy with this purchase. The customer service response was immediate, and I was refunded the money in less than 24 hours. Thank you!",5,25/07/2024
"I am only speaking as to my shopping experience and not on product quality or shipping as I only placed my order yesterday. The app has everything you can imagine at dirt cheap prices. Reviews of specific items seem to be positive overall. I have been seeing some reviewers say they were concerned with fraudulent charges and other issues of the sort. My way around that was by choosing to pay with Klarna. Klarna is a ?€?pay over time?€? app that?€?s pretty easy to be able to qualify for. This way I don?€?t have to submit my card information directly to Temu or other shopping apps. I?€?m also seeing negative, low star reviews from people who haven?€?t even ordered anything and are writing a review based off of other reviews they?€?ve read. That?€?s not how reviews work. You are supposed to be writing about your own personal experience and not piggybacking off of what others have said. That is not helpful and makes for inaccurate information. Just because other reviewers have had certain bad experiences doesn?€?t necessarily mean that you will. And if you are weary after reading people?€?s personal experiences, just don?€?t order from them. No need to negatively impact the apps overall rating just because you?€?re unsure. That?€?s my rant for the day. Thank you ????",5,25/07/2024
I'm very pleasantly surprised by Temu. Great prices and fast delivery. I'm a happy customer in San Diego.,5,25/07/2024
Will I still get my free stuff if I don't have my card,4,25/07/2024
"I have not bought anything. I just want to say that every single person who left a 1 star rating because they read a bad review is quite simply brain dead. This is not how reviews work. So...you saw a bad rating and that scared you so you left a bad review? With no actual interaction or experience of your own? Yeah, lots of people going through life this way these days. This just shows how brain dead people are today.",5,25/07/2024
"I have to return 2 out of 5 item on my first online purchase here. The reason is quality of product is not as I expected. I following all instructions very carefully. From my purchase order history, I click on the 2 items for return, then confirmed it with a new page to print out a returning label. I thought it was an easy process just like Walmart.com or Amazon. After confirmed on USPS tracking that merchandise was received, I chatted CS on refund status on my CC. Twice I was assured refund will show up in a couple of days. Then I notice in my account I have a credit balance appeared. Then I chat with CS third time telling him what I saw a credit balance. He then told me it is a credit to my account, not refund to my CC. I asked to talk to a supervisor. Hailey joined in and said there was an ""application page"" for refund method selection. I told her in my refund request process I did not see such a page. And I am not a happy custom to return for more shopping, the credit in my account is useless. I just want my money back. The chatting process took a lot of time. Either they were working with multiple customers or they are waiting for translation or something. I have done many online shopping and this is a first time dealing with a Chinese online retailer for refund. I doubt they will survive in the US online business for long. The store credit will be worthless. I am heading to my CC company for charge dispute now.",1,25/07/2024
I can't believe all the negative reviews that are all of a sudden popping up this week. I have ordered over 30 products from Temu and I have been 100% satisfied with every purchase so far. I was very skeptical when I made my first purchase so I just purchased a few items to test them out and I am glad I did. The shipping is not as fast as Amazon but the prices are much better than Amazon. Of course I look at individual reviews on each item before purchasing just like I do any online purchase from any company. I just find it strange that this company has been heavily promoting their business and is starting to get recognized and then these negative reviews are one right after another bringing this company's rating down. There are small businesses that are dependent on this company's success and they are trying to help bring value at the best price possible and that will be almost impossible if everyone leaves horrible ratings without giving them a chance. I know so many families who will depend on Temu this holiday season with the cost of living being so costly and I wouldn't want families to not trust this app based on reviews that could have been handled in a different manner.,5,25/07/2024
I never ordered from this company but was going to order something for my great niece until I read the reviews These companies like Temu and ALL other foreign companies are simply fake and lots of false advertisement USA should ban them ALL from social THEY ARE NOTHING MOR THAN SCAM ARTISTS!!! They take you for a run for your money and I no longer trust or believe in crap companies like that Get a real life and get off our social media You don?€?t deserve the chance to make so many people so unhappy with your business You should be banned from our country PERIOD????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!!!,1,25/07/2024

"This is my first order with the company, maybe the last. I placed an order 8 days ago. Today I discover they are holding my order to minimize their shipments. If this is the case I should have been informed that this is something they do.",2,25/07/2024
"So far so good. I am really happy with Temu.com so far. I decided to take a chance on them in early November. So far I?€?ve placed four orders with multiple items on different days. I?€?ve received two of my orders, waiting the others. I decided to take a chance on them November 4th. So far I?€?ve placed four orders with multiple items over time and I?€?ve received two of my orders.  I have no complaints. I have bought 2 20,000 mah power banks that so far worked great. Everything has been packaged well and tends to come in multiple packages. One thing I like for example is that I ordered  multiple items last night. This morning I decided to add three more items as it has not shipped yet. Under your order it gives you the option to add to order, I love that I?€?ve been able to use multiple discount coupons. The prices are amazing. I have one return I just did this morning for a pair of shoes that I ordered and they were too big. I thought I?€?d have to ship them back but in the app it gave me two options to return. A store credit or return to my credit card. They said to keep the shoes or donate them to charity which is nice because I didn?€?t have to send them back. The shipping said it would be free but I haven?€?t had to use that option because they said I could keep them. If  have any problems I will definitely update my review. Some of the items that I?€?ve ordered don?€?t have any reviews yet so in a way I took a chance on a few things but boy this is save me so much. I just retired and things are so tight. Moneywise I will definitely be buying from them in the future.Update: Dec 8, 2022I wrote my first review on November 13, 2022. I decided to come back and update because I have placed 7 or 8 orders with Temu. I?€?m waiting on a couple of orders that I recently placed. Everything has come that I have ordered within the time frame they mention. I?€?m glad if it?€?s going to be late that I?€?ll get five dollars off. I am trying to leave reviews on certain products that I get so it helps others. Shoe might fit a little differently depending on the style. There is a sizing chart in shoe listings. I?€?ve ordered 5 pairs of shoes. Three I had refunded because they did not fit well. Easy process. I can at this point say I really recommend them. Lori",5,26/07/2024
"I am very disappointed with all the clothes, poor quality material and very thin. Same goes for the car seat covers it?€?s so thin it like putting a cheap bed sheet on your car seat. Everything is cheap because it?€?s like shopping at the 99 cent store. Will not be buying again. Will have to return all items. I would be embarrassed to give these item as  Christmas gifts. Will not be recommending anything to anyone. Too bad I can?€?t send a picture than you all can see the car seat cover is so thin you can see my hands through the cloth because it?€?s so sheer and thin. It is probably made for one to two uses only. The shirt I bought looks like it was sewn inside out and someone took a scissor and cut the edges unevenly.",1,26/07/2024
"My order was ""lost""...I have to work like a mad man to try to fix it !!! kept calling customer service.they assured my order was being resent .. finally spoke to an agent 2 weeks later.she said that was not possible.the only way to resolve is to ask for refund.very dissatisfied.and I have ordered from them again ..some stuff is missing.told them about the situation...they just laughed like I was kidding...was not credited for ANYTHING...BUT vary good quality on what I did receive",3,26/07/2024

"First order was fairly easy and shipping was alright. But after only getting to play the daily credit giveaway for a couple days suddenly I can't play it anymore, for over a week now, I just keep getting ""this function is under construction please stay tuned"". Customer support chat is no help as they just go by a script, after 20 minutes in chat I'm told that not all customer's get to play the credit giveaway, that's just a lazy way of saying we don't want to fix it. I doubt I'll be ordering from here again.",2,26/07/2024
"Maybe two packages a little damage, just the box, so no big deal,...one light bulb didn't work, no big deal...OTHER PRODUCTS WERE GOOD AT NICE PRICE, HAVE ORDER TWICE AND ORDER A THIRD TIME TODAY..SO IM PRETTY HAPPY",5,26/07/2024
I order some merchandise and used my credit card.  My card was declined.  So I went into the sight and canceled the order.  Someone keeps trying to push the payment through.  I would like to know why?,1,26/07/2024
"I placed an order on November 7th. On November 9th I receive notice that it had shipped November 9th. Today is the 12th. On checking  the tracking number I realize that my package has been sitting in their warehouse for the past three days and when I called their CS number, I was informed that I will receive it by the 19th. So for some reason it is being held in their ware house for a total of ten days. Why??? After receiving Temu's response blaming either international shipping or USPS I need to clarify: the warehouse in question is in Los Angeles two hours from me by car. It had not been released to USPS.",1,26/07/2024
I?€?m really hoping I can back this 5star up! Was very excited to place my first order and then reading these reviews made me nervous. ???? I?€?ll update when I get it and hopefully I don?€?t have any issues.,5,26/07/2024
"What is your time worth?  According to this company my 9 hours was $20.  They lured me in with a 40% coupon.   When I went to use it.  It magically was expired.  Sounds like a scam.  Then they wouldn't honor the discount.   But offered $5. after saying thats the only thing they can do.  It went to a $20 credit.    So many lies caught in the text messages from them.  They couldn't answer my questions for over 9 hours.  I asked why, again no answer.   It felt like such a fraudulent experience.   I keep wondering why none of my questions could be answered, what were they hiding? As per customer service,  they suggested I share my experience.",1,26/07/2024
"I literally went crazy on the site because everything was so cheap. I?€?m a 59 yo female and I know better y?€?all may think. Lol! I received four boxes in all, and I?€?ll be returning about half of it, if not more. The items are like something you?€?d get at the dollar store. But I have to say they do have some items on there that are of decent quality and I?€?m keeping those!I look forward to writing up an excellent review of them on this site as well as Temu after I get my money returned. Try not to get too overly excited  on this site.",2,26/07/2024

It's been over a month and I haven't received my products. It is almost $86 worth of stuff. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone,1,27/07/2024
I have purchased many products from this site and for the most part they are of good quality and the prices are very very good.  I had a little issue with the credit and refund policy and after some communications I was able to chat with A great representative named Dada and she was very helpful and accommodating. And because of her I am pleased with this company once again.  The mailings are good and the communication and when they are coming are superb!!,4,27/07/2024
"Regarding returns, Your website says this: ?€?return shipping is free on your first return for any order,?€? which was the case with me. It says when you do a second additional return on the same order, you have to pay $7.99. I did not do a second return on the same order. Therefore as I already stated, I want the full amount refunded.  Also, why is someone contacting me for my PayPal account information? What kind of place is this?",1,27/07/2024
"at first the delivery was well! fast and only a day after the expected delivery day. Now, it?€?s 2 days over the expected delivery date and it?€?s nowhere near USPS!!",3,27/07/2024
"My experience with them great. I at first had problem- the inflatable doll I ordered had a hole in it, not inflated no matter what I tried. I needed it to drive high occupant lanes here in LA. So I contacted Dada from tamu. She contacted me right back and we met that evening. She offered to make things right, and boy did she do that ever. I m one high satisfy puppy. So upgraded stars to 4 (minus one for original hole in the doll). Now Dada is riding with me - passenger seat - in high occupant lanes. Problem solve.",4,27/07/2024
